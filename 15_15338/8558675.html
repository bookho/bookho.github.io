			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard the invitation of Leonard Mitchell, Emlin was not afraid, holding a silk hat and glaring at the smile. Entered the house calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t take off his coat, because “Professor” always carries a lot of auxiliary items, which is not so beautiful after losing his cover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin sat down in a tuxedo like this, leaning back against the back support, and leisurely said:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, it doesn't have to be so troublesome.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, report the price, no, just frankly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, I am sure you have it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He chuckled, bright red The eyes reflected that Leonard Mitchell did not care about the neatness of the clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of I know that you have any secrets, and the scenes that you have no understanding of me make Emlin feel comfortable and superior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard combed his black hair with his fingers and sat freely on the opposite chair, smiling without any panic and doubt:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At least I have to know who I want."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe me, maybe my friend." Emlin lightly lifted his chin and smiled gracefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard rubbed his eyes and leaned over his head as if thinking about something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, he laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, since you have already taken this The badge is coming, then I will answer you frankly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I do have a magical item that can steal other people's extraordinary abilities, but only one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you want to buy, £7,000, do not accept counter-offer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7000 pounds ? Similar magic items are so expensive? Although he didn't have to pay for himself, Emlin was shocked and couldn't keep the bloody style. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has automatically converted the money into how many dolls and how many sets of doll dresses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In two seconds, Emlin smiled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think about it, these two I will give you an answer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Leonard Mitchell hooked his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The house at 7 Pfister Street, Emrin seems to have never happened, hired a rental carriage to the steam station in the North District. Return all the way to the south of the bridge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remove the hat and look back at the carriage passing through the pedestrian street. Emlin laughed and walked into the harvest church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of a street tree and iron black gas light pole, the inconspicuous shadow suddenly floats, and Leonard Mitchell, who is black and green, emerges. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He appeared silently and did not attract any attention from passers-by. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The people of the Mother Earth Church?" Emlin frowned, as he said to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He paused for two seconds and left the rose flower street where the harvest church was located. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"7000 pounds? Why didn't he grab it?" On the other hand, Klein, who heard the return of the "Moon" Emlin, almost blurted out and made a sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the "Golden Dream" No. 3, "Flower Bow Tie" Jederson's reward amount, Klein speculated that the price of similar magical items is around 5,000 pounds, even if the premium is as high as 6,000 pounds, who knows, Leonard. Chel opened 7,000 pounds directly! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it a legacy of the higher sequence, stealing the extraordinary ability of others is only one of the effects? No, if that's the case, how can the price start at 10,000 pounds... The poet classmate, I didn't know how you were a profiteer before, you obviously acted freely, don't care much about money... Klein couldn't help but sigh A few words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since there are clues, seeing the dawn, and using money to solve, Klein does not want to seek other channels, so as not to have an accident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly calculated his own net worth and found that it was affordable:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Counting the pharmacist's prepaid commission of 300 pounds, the 'smartwriter''s bounty of 5,400 pounds and the money found on the body, deducting the 200 pounds paid to the 'Magician' lady, I now have a total of 12,767 pounds plus 5 gold coins, this is not the change of 3 Sule 8 pence.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition, Miss 'Justice' will pay 2,000 pounds before the end of the week. And the cost of the £1800 'psychologist' feature, I am much richer than I thought, even in Beckland, it can be called a rich man. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took a breath and no longer hesitated, letting the banknotes fly over the top of the debris pile and land on the table.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He carefully counted £7,500 in cash and put them aside – £7,000 for magical items, £500 for Emlin “risk” fees.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哎, I’ve worked so hard, I lost most of it... Klein has a “world”, let him put out a prayer, telling Emlin that there is no problem, and after a quarter of an hour, a ceremony is accepted. Mr. "The Fool" is given a transfer.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, Klein also let the "world" 叮嘱 "the moon" Emlin, do not rush to complete the transaction after getting cash, I have to wait until tomorrow - he is afraid that the Zoroastrian family in Leonard Mitchell will notice the fog on the banknotes, and want to have a "smelling" process, just like giving Em Lin’s badge is the same.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A quarter of an hour later, Klein’s eyesight is reduced by half the thickness of the remaining The Golden Pounds, sighed and returned to the real world.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, it is already 10:40 on Friday, and there are still passengers arriving at Olav Island. 8 hours or so.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s time to intimidate the “probability” again... Klein whispers, holding a ceremony and bringing out the “all black The eye of the iron cigarette case.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He guessed that the fat pharmacist Dirkwell had any doubts about this, so he deliberately got the scorpion into the bathroom Handling.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See "The Probability" re-quiet, Klein quickly handled the "All Black Eyes" and the iron cigarette case, long and comfortable Tolerance, the time is calculated: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It should be able to reach the connector person who handed it to Dakwell, no need to do anything else. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Klein is quite worried about another question:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 'The Eye of All Black' appeared in front of the 'real creator', and there is also his spiritual pollution, so take it out every few hours, maybe it will be locked by him, send the strong to come and look for it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"However, every time it takes a minute or two, the problem should be small. Even if you notice, their sense of position will not be too precise, hey, involving ' The real Creator, can't use divination to determine, can only improve the alert, but fortunately, this is the last time, and only seven or eight hours to the destination... Why should I give myself a Flag, hey, just now I didn't think about anything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein picked up the "probability of ambiguity" and returned to the living room, seeing the fat pharmacist squatting in the easy chair, The owl Harry is picking up and doesn't seem to need a break. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time passes by, and the bright sun at high altitude gradually moves westward and lower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Klein, who is keeping his eyes closed, suddenly straightens his body and feels that a strong danger is about to come! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This goes beyond the spiritual intuition of the "Divination" and the dangerous premonition of the "Clown", as if from the invisible fog that appears strangely around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are enemies! 'The Swallower' Ulothus or the 'Aurora' of the Holy One?" Klein opened his eyes and thought seriously. Take countermeasures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, whenever there is a mistake, he has to consider the matter of resurrection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the fat pharmacist Dirkwell and the owl Harry, it is absolutely impossible to escape! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He first hopes that the only ones can only blur the induction, can only determine a large range, not necessarily find themselves or "probability of the ambiguity", but Considering that this is a ship, there is no sea of ​​people nearby. The goal seems to be not difficult to lock. At that time, the trouble will be even bigger, so I have to give up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the passenger ship, the void suddenly tears, revealing an invisible door full of complex symbols. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two slightly pale hands stick out from the crack in the door and slammed back, letting the whole body come out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wears the black bonnet and classical dark robes that the old man likes, but he looks less than forty, and the brown hair is slightly rolled, giving people an unusual Hard feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He seems to have countless illusions in his dark eyes, and it seems to hide a world of chaos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s dangerous feelings grew stronger, only the expression changes, and it was scared that Dirkwell and Owl Harry did not dare to move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He no longer hesitated, based on the plans made in the past few days for similar situations, leaning forward and picking up the "probability of probability." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just judge the behavior of the malicious person who just arrived, I want 1 point!" Klein whispered, throwing out the milky white scorpion, and subconsciously Pray to the goddess in my heart, hope that the nephew who has just been intimidated will not be able to obey and can play a role. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, he performed extremely calmly, lest the scorpion sense its own tension and take the opportunity to make trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the collision sound, the "probability of the cockroaches" rolled a few laps, fixed at 1 point of bright red blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The passenger ship was over the air, and the man in the black robe of less than forty had already reflected the entire vessel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He spread out of spirituality, glanced around the circle, and the detective grasped the void in front of him, slamming open a door that was almost invisible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strongman stepped inside and disappeared into place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first class of Klein suddenly felt dangerous and had gone away, and it was difficult to contain it quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stared at the "probability of the probability" on the coffee table, could not help but feel a sentence in his heart:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "If this scorpion does not have such a big negative effect, it can be fully utilized, it is simply an artifact!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is not a seal of '0' level, but it is The uniqueness of the 'monster' route..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Just now, what happened just now? "Fat pharmacist Dirkwell found his courage and asked cautiously.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein kept his posture and responded calmly:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't need to know. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand, I understand that the more you know, the more dangerous. Dakwell wiped the cold sweat on his head.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
