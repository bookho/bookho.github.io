			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind blew from the body of Bishop Miller and propped up his dark blue priest's uniform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click here! The nearby road branches were broken and flew into the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Donna’s body was involuntarily lifted, thrown a few meters, fell to the ground, and suffered from pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only her, Cecil, Denton, Dimodo, Harris, etc. were also taken by the wind, fell to different positions, only Kerry Weiss, Teague and Uldi, or because of long-term exercise weight is not light, or because of obesity and heavy body abnormalities, just fell to the ground and rolled a few laps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a continuous reversal and backward movement of Miller, the bishop of Miller, to escape the oncoming wind pressure slap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein and Daniz didn’t go to the hard-resistance, and they followed the trend, drifting like a kite, and they were about to fall down, but they finally managed to balance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hurricane just stopped, and the six figures were revealed in the mist that was blown away. They all wore black cloaks, lost their heads, only the neck Still bleeding, only the swirling breeze propped up the hood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holly! Lotus! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are buzzing sounds in their throats before they are ready to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗖! Hey! Hey! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thin, sharp wind blade shot, leaving a distinct, deep gap in where Klein rolled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;蹬蹬蹬! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the lantern, the dark blue priest's robe gently raised on both sides of Bishop Miller, six headless people rushed to Klein, Elland and others. I stepped on the ground and swayed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A headless blame is hard to deal with, now comes directly to six...and there are obviously polluted bishops! "Flame" Daniz saw this scene, could not help but some scalp numb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a flash of brass flew in front of him and he flew into the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When, when, when, Azick copper whistle fell to the ground and bounced a few times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a cry, the six headless people changed their direction at the same time, rushing to the position where the Azick copper whistle stopped, leaving Bishop Miller alone. People stand in place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein seized the opportunity, lifted his left palm, and pulled off the "sun brooch" in the coat and threw it to Captain Allan, who is closest to him. And succinctly shouted: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pour spirituality, five seconds, holy water."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He did not care about the silk hat that was blown away. He leaned down halfway and rushed to Bishop Miller from left to right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗖嗖嗖! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind blades are intensively shot, all aimed at Klein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ground instantly reveals many traces of knife-cutting axe, and Klein either rolls over, or flies, or holds the ground with his hands, jumps up and hides After the first round of fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark red glow in Bishop Miller’s eyes was more vigorous, and he raised his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗖嗖嗖嗖嗖! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the attack of the wind blade is like a machine gun, and Klein has only had time to hide most of it, and the body is torn and turned into thin and light paper. Chips, flying in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein emerged in the other direction and continued to rush to Bishop Miller, to bring the distance between the two to the level of fitness! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alan, who caught the "sun brooch", immediately felt the heat The taste, I can't wait to take off my clothes and jump into the water that is about to freeze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little bit of the words left by Gelman Sparo, he took out a tin-iron square jug from the inside of the garment, unscrewed the lid, and poured out the full part of the stalwart inside. The scent of wine quickly spreads around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Flame" Daniz looked around in a circle and had a certain grasp of the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He licked his knees on one knee and his palms pressed against the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two red-hot fire snakes emerged from the air, spreading against the surface of the place where the Aziq copper whistle was, and casting a blazing fire wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He originally wanted to throw a fireball and bow to Bishop Miller, so that Gelman Sparrow could easily jump to the other side with the help of flames. After attacking, but after watching the violent wind in the area surrounding the bishop, he rationally gave up the plan, preparing to clean up the headless monsters first, to prevent them from interfering with the real strength of German Sparrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crivis, Cecil, Teague, and Harris have now stood up again, recovered the guns, and will be Urdi, Donna, Dimodo and others are protected in the middle, guarding other monsters that may come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their experience tells them that it is best not to rush into the battle that is not human, without training in advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;蹬! Hey! Hey! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The six headless people don't care about the burning of the flames, smashing the red walls, hungry dogs rushing to grab the Azick copper whistle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gave Airland time, allowing him to calmly infuse spirituality into the "sun brooch", waiting for the holy water to condense and flow into the square jug. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz sees the group of headless people rushing into a ball, the heart is fretting, half down and back, his face is red and the right palm condenses a handle The tip of the blazing flame rifle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stepped forward, turned his arms, and threw the flame gun out, screaming and hitting a headless man and nailing it On the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blazing fire leaps up, and the small half of the headless person turns directly into ashes, and the rest is burning, and the black and green gas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing the attack succeeded, Daniz was about to make persistent efforts, but suddenly realized some crazy, terrifying hunger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This moment, he seems to have come to the abyss, only one step, will fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that Galman Spalo no longer suppresses the crazy soul in the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After using the paper man for three times, Klein finally entered the scheduled distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gloves of his left palm burst into a hunger that suppressed for a long time, and he squirmed and grew a dark gold scale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein's pupils faded as if they were erected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, in his nephew, the bishop of Miller, who was swaying in a dark blue robe, was shown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In silence, the middle-aged man who was about to make a lot of wind blades suddenly leaned back and solidified for a second. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of his dark red light have lost his sense of reason and are full of madness. His skin has become smooth and colorful, just like some aquatic The epidermis of the creature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He made a sigh of relief from the depths of the sea, and suddenly a slippery, disgusting tentacle under the blue robes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Psychologist" "Frenzy"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein originally wanted to interrupt the other side’s attack and create opportunities for subsequent control. However, after the frenzy, Bishop Miller lost control directly! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long-lost or contaminated opponent lost his mind as the last shackle and immediately stepped into the abyss out of control! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing this situation, Klein's pupils shrink, no longer hesitate, switching the driven soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the other side of the madness, the gloves of his left palm were dyed with gold, his expression became majestic, and his eyes once again locked in Bishop Miller. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his pupil, two light-emitting lights flashed in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huo Ran, Bishop Miller made a scream, both palms and tentacles, all recovered, grabbed his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The piercing of his spirit has produced an indescribable ultimate pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Interrogator"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein stood up with his right palm and stood up, his left hand then brightened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he leaned back and opened his arms as if he was hugging the sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A large, pure, blazing brilliance descended from the sky and fell to Bishop Miller, completely covering him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a white hustle and the wind was blowing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sequence 5, "The Priest of Light"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Müller’s body began to evaporate, first the epidermis, then the tentacles, and finally the flesh and blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the brilliant beam disappeared, he was not adult, and he became a monster composed of white bones and flesh and blood, and his breath was rather weak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he has not died yet! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The uncontrollable vitality of an uncontrollable person is unprecedented! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s expression did not change, and he rushed to the side of Biller’s remnant, kneeling down on one knee, leaning forward, pressing his left palm The beach is fleshy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He does not continue to use the "light priest" ability, in order to leave food for "squirming hunger"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The palm of the glove position, silently broke a gap, which grows two rows of illusory, white-sounding teeth, madly swallowing flesh and blood, White bones and spirituality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Bishop Miller is still struggling, he is solid and fleshy, has grown a few new tentacles, trying to wrap it around Klein and pull him into his own embrace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein lost his cane, pulled out the revolver, pointed at the monster, and fired five shots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰砰砰砰砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or light gold or brass or silver bullets hit Bishop Miller, igniting a flame of different colors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Miller once again screams from the soul, no longer able to counter "squirming hunger", even the flesh and blood with the soul all turned into a rapids, put it into A greedy mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In two or three seconds, only the pieces of clothing left on the ground, the wreckage of the banknotes, and the dark blue with a little slow condensed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the difference between "swallowing" and "grazing." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein wants the latter more, but there is no other food here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Captain Allan has made two waves of holy water in the square jug. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz quickly shouted at him:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Throw in the past!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alan did not hesitate to throw the jug to the headless man who was robbing the copper whistle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cough, Daniz cleared his throat and stood up straight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He left his palm leisurely, his right hand pushed straight forward, and quickly gathered a red-colored fire crow in his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These semi-illusive fire crows flew out and followed different routes, hitting the square jug at the same time, just in the group of headless people. top. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
