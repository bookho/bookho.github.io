			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am no stranger to Mr. "Gate"? In addition to the "Foolish Man", I am no stranger to the Seven Gods, and only entered the church of the god of steam and machinery... "Magic" Firth is confused, while thinking back to the high level that he can reach. High personality exists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the number is very small, she quickly ruled out other possibilities. Suddenly, her eyes lit up, she thought of something, and she thought of the first time with "fool" "Some of the contents of Mr. Dialogue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked at the top of the bronze long table covered in fog, and the voice shook slightly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Yes, who made the full moon slang?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein laughs and says:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full Moon Proverb... What is this? "Justice" Audrey and others listen to you, I see you, just like ordinary people who have just entered the occult world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have never heard of the so-called "full moon slang" before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, Miss "Magician" is not very simple, even knowing Mr. "Men", clearly related matters, my initial judgment is no problem... although The level of extraordinary materials she needs is low, but there are too many possibilities... The "hidden" Jia De Li Ya micro-invisible location is down, and I plan to ask Mr. "Mr." questions in detail when I want to communicate freely, and I am willing to This comes at a price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One can make Russell’s solemn mention in the diary, let the “fool” Mr. Mouth’s relatively formal existence, will inevitably involve many secrets, never simple ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, "Magic" Firth breathed a sigh of relief, feeling that he was one step closer to solving the "curse". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least, I already know who the slang was at the full moon... She lowered her eyes and sincerely said to Mr. "The Fool":<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your reminder."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein did not say much, nor did he point out that Mr. "Men" suspected the Abraham family The ancestor Bethel, looking around, said in a relaxed tone:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You start."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;When he finished, he immediately manipulated the "world" and hoarsely said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have two magical items I want to sell."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two magical items... Mr. "World" has been able to come up with something of great value at every recent gathering...not the leader of Mr. "The Fool"..." "Agreement" Audrey also sighed and amazedly turned his attention to the bottom of the bronze long table, and looked forward to waiting for the "world" to display items and introduce capabilities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"""""" """""" The secrets of the island were all traded to each other, and they silently sighed and were frustrated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are five hours to arrive at Paso Island. He can’t wait to fly over, finish his duties, then leave there, find the Obnis Sea monster, and promote to the ocean. singer". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, he can explore the original island with the "world" and get the corresponding harvest to ease his "financial crisis"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And "Sun" Dairik, "Moon" Emlin and "Magic" Firth have some curiosity about magical items, but lack The necessary desire to buy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of them is because of the sequence 4, they can apply to the "six-member council", pick one from the magical items accumulated in the silver city, one is thinking Hunting competitions will be rewarded. For the time being, it is not clear what is specific. Blindly buying items outside is prone to duplication and waste, and two or three thousand pounds of cash on the body are still prepared to pay for the clues, and one is purely no money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If appropriate, and does not conflict with the two magical items on her body, she is willing to buy it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two big customers in the expectation are more or less motivated, and the "world" is low and laughs:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One piece is 'Lucky Balance', this is my own name..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said to the "fool" Applying, there is a silver necklace with an ancient coin-like pendant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction to the magical effects and negative effects, he looked at "Justice" Audrey, especially reminded: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This necklace is not recommended for those who lack sufficient combat power to buy. Although it can make people avoid deadly attacks, the subsequent explosive reversal is equally dangerous. It must have enough combat power and be sensitive enough. Only have the opportunity to survive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking that I am more biased, more control and influence, and no practical experience, "Justice" Audrey Feeling lost, I said that Mr. "World" is right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. "World" is still very good to me for the members of the Tarot Club. I am willing to make such a reminder that this will hinder him from selling goods... Li adjusted her mind about the "world" in her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "hidden" is more and more familiar, the effect of "lucky balance", she seems to have seen it before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A picture quickly flashed back, and finally settled on a few scenes, Jia De Li Ya's light shrinks, slightly stunned: <br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Senior?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This should be "the blood will be" Seignona The root necklace looks very similar and the effect is basically the same! Where did Galman Sparo get it? What did he do again? The "Future" has not been docked these days. Have I missed any important news? "The Hidden" Jia De Li Ya instinctively suspected that the "world" has made a big deal! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein thought about it, manipulating the "world" and laughing low:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is dead "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He does not preclude Miss "Justice" who initially knew that Gelman Sparrow is equal to "the world", anyway, there are already two clear, and This identity is also not intended to be used frequently, only occasionally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A strong and frequently shot member will make others more interested in Tarot! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is dead...German Sparo has killed Senigal? When I last fought with him, there were only some advantages... The "hidden" Jia Delia found that she could not see the strength of the "world" more and more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the bounty of "blood above" is higher than her, it is mainly because of the bad things that are done, and the strength of the magical items itself, Jia Deli Ya is slightly stronger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--She and Seniool did not have a conflict, and they had the upper hand several times, but could not reinvent each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for Gilman Sparo, when the "Future" meets, she thinks that the other party is not as good as her own, and may not even be able to win the "good disease" Lieutenant General" Trey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the crazy adventurer completes the promotion and hunt the "slayer" Gilshies, she judges that the other has a true pirate general strength, and is in himself One level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, this is only a week later, and Gilman Sparo completed another hunting, killing the top three in the pirate generals. "Senior! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This thing, "hidden" Jia De Li Ya asked himself can't do it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dead? "The blood will be above" Senegal is dead? Galman Sparogan? Is this a sequence of 5 in a week? And it's still stronger than one... even if it's the "fool" Mr., this strength is too exaggerated, right? In particular, he has not yet reached the demigod... Will it be done by other leaders? The church should have a corresponding file, but my current status is not eligible for reading... "The man hanging down" Alger was shocked and could not help but think of a reasonable explanation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
