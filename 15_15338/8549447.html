			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking on the streets of Zouteland, blowing a hot breeze, the high-spirited Klein suddenly thought of one thing:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only 3 pence of change left on the body. It takes 4 pence to return to the Iron Cross Street in the public carriage, and take 1 gold pound of banknotes to find the other party, just like taking 100 pieces before crossing. Like a bottle of low-priced mineral water, there is no other way to really pull the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sit 3 km with 3 pence, the rest of the journey back?" Klein stepped into the pocket, slowing down and thinking about other ways. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No!" Soon, he vetoed the previous idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the journey is light, and it’s been a while, and it’s too unsafe to have a 12-pound “big money”! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And before worrying that the revolver was confiscated by the "night of the night", today deliberately did not bring it on the body, I really encountered the danger caused by the death of Welch, will No resistance! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let’s change bank for change in the neighborhood? No, no, five-thousandths of the fee is too extravagant!” Klein shook his head silently, thinking about it. I feel distressed when I think about the possible handling fee! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way they were excluded one by one, Klein suddenly saw his eyes and saw the home coat store! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the most normal idea is not to buy the right price to find the right thing? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; formalwear, shirts, vests, trousers, boots and canes are all on the budget, buy early and buy later! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, it’s very troublesome to try on clothes, and Banson knows better than me, and he will pay more, so he can wait for him to come back and think again...<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where to buy a cane? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes! There is a saying that is good, the cane is the gentleman's best self-defense weapon, can be used as a crowbar, a handgun is a civilized fighting style! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the thoughts, Klein made up his mind, turned his body and turned into the "Wilkel clothing store." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The layout of the store is very similar to the clothing store before his crossing. The left side of the wall is a row of formal dresses, and the center is shirts, pants, vests and ties. On the right side, there are leather shoes and leather boots in the glass cabinet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. What do you want to buy?" A male clerk in a white shirt and red vest greeted him and asked questions politely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Kingdom of Lun, because of the status of wealthy gentlemen, like to wear white shirts, black vests, black trousers, black dresses, the color is quite monotonous, so men The maids, clerk and waiter class are required to be bright or multicolored to distinguish between the master servant or the noble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In contrast to this, the ladies and ladies have different shades and are decorated in a gorgeous manner. The maid can only be black with white or white with black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of a male clerk’s question, Klein thought about it:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A little, harder."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kind that can blow the other dog's head! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clerk of the red vest looked at Klein in a hidden way and led him into the store, pointing to the row of canes in the corner:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The root with gold is made of ironwood, very heavy, very hard, 11 Sule 7 pence, would you like to give it a try?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;11 Sule 7 pence? Why don't you grab it? Is it great to set aside gold? Klein was shocked by the price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His face is quiet, nodded slightly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Klein had just taken the cane, he felt heavy and tried to move and found that he could not wave smoothly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Too heavy." Klein leaned his head and let out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is no excuse! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red vest clerk puts back the ironwood cane and points to the other three lanes:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is walnut, made by Mr. Hess, the most famous canesmith in Tingen, 10 Sule 3 pence... This is water, wood, hard as steel, 7 Sule 6 pence... This is white The tree heart of the Boli tree is also made of silver, 7 Sule 10 pennies..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took the test and found that the weight is more suitable Then, he slammed and knocked, roughly grasping the hardness of each cane, and finally, he chose the cheapest one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the root of the sinking wood." Klein pointed to the silver vest in the hands of the red vest clerk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, sir, please pay with me over there. If this cane is worn or smudged, you can give it to us for treatment. Free.” The red vest clerk led Klein to the counter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took the opportunity to unfold the four golden pounds in the palm of his hand and take out one of the smaller two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello, 7 Sule 6 pence." The clerk behind the counter smiled. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein wanted to maintain the gentleman’s decent appearance, but he couldn’t help but open his hand when he held the left hand of a gold-credit banknote:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can it be cheaper?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr., this is handmade, and our cost is high. The red vest clerk replied, "and the owner is not there, we are not qualified to help him cut the price."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clerk behind the counter followed the road:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sir, sorry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Klein handed the notes over, from the red vest clerk Take the black cane with silver on the pole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waiting for the gap in the change, he stepped back a few steps, pulled the distance, and tried the waving effect of the "deputy weapon". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜! Hey! Hey! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind was heavy, the texture was broken, and Klein nodded with satisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He re-projected his sight to the front, preparing to see the banknotes and coins, but suddenly found that the red vest clerk was far away, and the counter was retracted to the corner, tight The double-barreled shotgun hanging against the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kingdom of Lun has a semi-regulatory policy on hot weapons. If you want to hold a gun, you need to apply for a "full-scale weapon use certificate" or "hunting certificate", but No matter which one, you can't have military control things like bursting rifles, steam high pressure guns and six-barrel machine guns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All types of weapons use certificate" can buy and store any kind of civilian firearms at will, but it is extremely troublesome, even if a certain position of the merchant may pass the review "Hunting license" is relatively easy, even if the farmer in the suburbs can get it, but this kind of license is limited to the use of shotguns, and there are a number of restrictions, many people with thin assets will apply for one, in case of emergency. Self-protection, such as now...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... Klein looked at the two guards who were alert and twitched, and he laughed and said:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, this cane is very suitable for waving, I am very satisfied."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See him without attack intention, behind the counter The clerk relaxed and looked up and handed out the banknotes and copper coins that he had just found. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took a glance and saw two 5 Sule, two 1 Sule notes and one 5 pence, one pence Copper coins, I could not help but nod. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After doing all this, Klein put the banknotes and coins separately, took the cane, helped the hat, walked out of the "Wilkel's coat store" like a gentleman, and took the extra-orbitless public carriage near the luxury. After a transfer and a total of 6 pence, I returned to the apartment smoothly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close the door, he repeated the 11 pounds 12 Sule's banknotes three times before putting them into the desk drawer, and then finding out the copper wheel, Pistol with wooden grip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;叮叮当当当! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five brass-colored bullets have fallen on the desk, and Klein will have a silvery "hunting bullet" with a complex pattern and a dark emblem. The pieces are stuffed into the runner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, he only stuffed five, leaving space for preventing accidental shots, and the rest was stored in the small iron with the five normal bullets just removed. Inside the box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wheel is closed, and Klein Horan has a lot of security. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He happily put the revolver into the armpit of the armpit, firmly buckled, and then practiced the action of unbuttoning the gun over and over again, the arms are sore After a while, I will continue until the sky is dark, and the voice of the tenant moves in the aisle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call! Klein vomited and put the revolver back into his arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until this time, he replaced his formal attire and vest, put on a daily brown-yellow coat, and did his arm to relax. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哒,哒,哒, the footsteps are close, the key is inserted into the keyhole, and the twisting sounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melissa, wearing a soft black hair, pushed in and the nose twitched invisibly, her eyes swept over the stove that was not lit at all, in the eyes The color of the gods suddenly dimmed a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Klein, I cooked the ingredients left over last night, and Banson might be back tomorrow." Melissa turned to look at her brother. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein put his hands in his pockets and leaned his thighs against the edge of the desk, smiling:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, Let's go out and eat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go out to eat?" Melissa asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How about the 'Silver Crown Restaurant' on Dessert Street? I heard that it tastes great." Klein made a suggestion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, but..." Melissa still didn't figure out the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein smiled and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Celebrate me to find a job."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you finding a job?" Melissa's voice didn't consciously grow bigger. "Yes, but the interview at the University of Timing is not tomorrow?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Additional work." Klein laughed and took out the stack of paper money from the drawer. "They also paid for the salary around me."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melissa looked at the one gold pound and Sule, and her eyes were very big:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Goddess...you, They, you, what job are you looking for?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This...Kline looks awkward and considers the language:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A security company with a mission to find, collect and protect antiquities, they need professional consultants, five-year contracts, £3 a week."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"...Are you worried about this thing last night?" Melissa Shen Silently said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein nodded in a hurry:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, the faculty at Tingen University is more decent, But this job, I prefer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
