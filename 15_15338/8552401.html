			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein subconsciously smashed both hands into the pocket, one holding the "Yangyan Charm" and one holding the "Azick Copper Whistle" . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is keenly aware that the latter’s cold but soft extraordinary touch has disappeared and seems to be being suppressed by invisible forces, while the former is still warm and reassuring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this kind of peace of mind, Klein enters a semi-meditation state, eliminating the panic and no longer has any luck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned his head and gave Leonard Mitchell a look and sneered at Meco. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he relied on the ability of the "clown" to control his expression and laughed at Mega Koos:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want coffee, or black tea, or don't you want anything?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Megosuo stroked his stomach as if listening to something: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A cup of warm water, I suddenly want to talk to you about Lanerus, I feel that you know a lot."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who is this telling you?" Leonard had not seen the usual swaying and swaying, and he was quite stiff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mego Ossie giggled: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My child told me that he Know a lot, he is very smart!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... Klein resisted the rush of the swearing, turned to the partition, and signaled Leonard to stabilize the Meco . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard forcibly lifted the corners of the mouth and pointed at the sofa area:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is It’s what I want to say, and we want to talk to you about Llanus.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luoshan at the reception desk is slightly stunned and puzzled With all this, I suddenly found that I didn't need to do anything myself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Klein stepped through the partition and directly unscrewed the door of the Dunn Smith office and slammed it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the first amazed and dignified Dunn, screaming:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain "It’s a big deal!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know what 'Lam' is what Lairus said!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Den is standing up and pointing to the outside:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Megos?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He obviously heard Leonard’s horrified voice, but couldn’t see the two players’ faces full of cold and sweaty eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein nodded and explained very quickly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I tried to open I watched Mei Gao Osi, and confirmed her mental condition, but my spirituality stopped my attempt, constantly 'telling me, don't watch, don't look! I will die!'<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This reminds me of a sentence, 'Do not look directly at God'. The baby in the belly of Mei Gaoousi is definitely a mythical creature, even if it is not the evil spirit that tries to be born, or the child of the evil spirit. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain, reminiscent of the black altar in Hood Eugen's memory, reminiscent of his 'psychologist' ability, associated with Lalwu The tragic world described in the letter, I think my guess is likely to be close to the truth: Llanus gets the ritual magic associated with the 'real creator' from the members of the Aurora, with the help of Hood Eugen, let Mei Gao Osi became a carrier of a certain force, and this force will rely on resentment, depression and gray flying around the factory. Growing up until maturity, or the ritual itself must be able to succeed with these resentments, depression, and darkness!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Den seriously thought about it for ten seconds, expression Dignified nodded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course, we can't do nothing. You tell Leonard, hold Megos, try not to let her leave the company, and then inform Mrs. Oliana and Rosanne to let the non-combatants evacuate! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will go behind the Chanis Gate after the telegraph, we must do the worst, that is, the helper of the church has not arrived yet, and The baby in the stomach of Mei Gaoousi was born."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My captain of the night squad of the city of Tingen has the right to use the holy race at a critical juncture Linna's ashes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ash of Saint Selena...the ashes of the high sequence strong...The seal core of the Chanis Gate...Klein is slightly settled Some of them, the thoughts are turning: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain, we can also ask for 'deceased' and 'mechanical heart', they should have similar holy relics ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speaking of this, Klein suddenly flashed a flash of light and muttered to himself:<br /><br />& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lalhous' case was attributed to the 'deceased' process... They just had a senior member out of control during that time, and I and Daniel helped..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In whisper, his voice suddenly becomes bigger:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain, you ask again" "Patient", asks if the player who lost control before has tracked or monitored Mei Gaoousi?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You suspect that his loss of control is due to Mei The pollution of the baby in Gao Osi's belly? When I re-examined it, Mei Gaoousi was also responsible for them...” Dunn solemnly replied, “Can't delay any more, you go to Mrs. Oliana, I take time to shoot. The telegram first asks for help from the church, then gives the 'deceiver' and 'mechanical heart', um, but also to the police department to telegraph, let them find ways to excuse the evacuation of the surrounding people."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Klein walked a few steps and suddenly remembered one thing, that is, Meco Wire "visit" is so sudden such a coincidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a red chimney house in the mind, and he was busy turning back to Dunn Road:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Captain, there is still something, do you still remember the coincidences I have said? There are clues to the Antignus family notes in the house opposite the kidnapping case. Riel Bieber did not escape from Timing, Henas in time. Van Cente was exposed for a coincidence, another Aurora member happened to meet me, lost his life directly, etc., etc."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" These coincidences are relatively invisible and hard to detect. Today, Mei Gaoousi’s sudden door-to-door after we found the letter from Lalhous is too obvious and too direct. This coincidence is already naked and undisguised! I think The one behind may be on the stage!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And, why is Mrs. Shelen going to risk killing Maynard? Is this also a coincidence? '?'<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dun thought about it and replied solemnly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I will add this to the telegram."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein didn't waste time, pulled out and went straight to the opposite accountant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Oliana is making a budget for the last three months, wanting to finish ahead of time, lest the captain forget this thing, failing to submit it in time, she saw gram Ryan came in and smiled and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Little Moretti, what are you going to reimburse this time?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein breathed a sigh of relief:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mrs. Oliana, today, go home, go home immediately."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Olianna snorted and stared blankly at the opposite face filled with dignity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few seconds, she stood up in a panic:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well!" Oliana almost did not do anything to pack, took the bag, and ran to the door of the accounting room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After entering the corridor, she turned around and looked at Klein deeply, drawing a blushing moon on her chest:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You will be blessed by the goddess!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you... Klein responded silently and passed the partition to the reception hall. I saw that Leonard was talking to Melous and talking about all kinds of things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein leaned over with Rosanne, flipped the cup and lifted the thermos, then whispered:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Go home, it's dangerous, come back tomorrow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rosanna opened his mouth, but slowly closed in Klein’s serious and solemn expression. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She tidyed up for ten seconds, took the bag and left the reception desk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she passed by Klein, she bit her lip and pressed down the voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "In fact, how much I hate to be extraordinary, there are more people who worship the night..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all the civilian personnel were evacuated from the Blackthorn Security Company, Klein will warm up to the front of Meco, and bend down and put it down:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "I still have things to deal with, wait for the next one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he got up, he got his way to Leonard’s ear, from his throat Spit the voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stabilize her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard licked his teeth, He licked his mouth and continued to chat stiffly. He found that Megakos gradually became a little annoyed, and his mind was sometimes concentrated and scattered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein returned to the captain’s office and found that Dunn had gone to the ground. There was a translated call from the "Punge" team on the table: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes. We will come over immediately."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes...that is out of control" The punisher "because it is because Mei Gaoousi... Kline is difficult to calmly walk to the corridor, I wonder if he is waiting for the captain to come out with the holy ashes, or waiting for the arrival of the reinforcements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哎, I don’t know if the high-level powerhouse knows how to transmit... It shouldn’t work... He’s been around for a few laps, and suddenly he feels both physically and mentally And found that the gas lamps on both sides were stained with blue.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dim and deep, Dunn walked out along the underground ladder, holding a palm in one hand Square casket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This box is both made of pure silver and gives the bones a feeling of a mysterious pattern. The closer it is, the more Klein is. The colder the feeling, the more cool it seems to infiltrate the blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dun's face is reflected in the blue light, to Klein:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" After you go to the Chanis Gate and take an aggressive seal, choose which one to choose. According to your own situation, I have already confessed to the singer and the internal caretaker, paying attention to avoiding hidden dangers, among them, '2' There are three seals, which are..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, I took away the ashes of St. Serena, and the Sika and the internal caretaker could not leave. Their position."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Frye and the lofty Loy Yao are helping at the Cohenri family, preparing for the funeral, and the Church of St. Serena The bishop went to the country to preach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay." Klein didn't hesitate and turned to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he reached the crossroads, he suddenly stopped, because he knew that most of the seals behind the Chanis Gate in Tingen belonged to "3". Level, it is difficult to affect the baby in the stomach of Mei Gaoousi, the lowest is also a mythical creature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
