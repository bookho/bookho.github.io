It is bright and the outline is not too deep, as if it were in the southern part of Intis and in the areas of Rumburg and Segal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just seeing him, Klein has a picture flashing back in his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When entering the "Flying Fish and Wine" bar, he looked around professionally to find out if there were any objects that needed attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer at the time was no, the other party was drinking, curious, and no different from other guests. The appearance was not unique, but the black cloak gave grams. Ryan left a certain impression, so that he recognized the tracker in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to do?" Maintaining his own Klein slightly lowering his back, as if he were ready to be a giant cat creature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black cloak man laughs again:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The fighting skills and treatment you just showed The method is very much in line with my aesthetic. I want to ask if I catch up. Are you interested in joining us?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although the guy named Logan just did In the fake Lutheran's informant, but the 'White Shark' Hamilton is really associated with a number of pirates, acting as a disgraceful character, you who hit him in his bar will definitely be remembered by him. There are certain troubles in the follow-up, and I can help you solve this problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are an adventurer, you must dream of treasure, we are a group of partners who are looking for treasures to gather together, chasing the 'ghost empire', 'Solomon The legends of 'the legacy of 'the secret of the old spring', 'the key to the god of death', 'the sinking of the Laurel' and 'the secret of Russell', walk through the five seas, to this day, although the main purpose has not been completed First, but also found many missing pirate ships, huh, this sounds similar to the mouse just now, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He cleared his throat道:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Frankly speaking, we are a group of pirates, a group of pirates composed of adventurers, but we only rob the merchant ships when we are particularly poor. Passenger ships, and will not harm innocent people, our main energy is looking for treasures, and often there will be gains. Really, I used to sleep in a bed of gold coins. If you encounter other pirate ships, we will also strike them. To get supplies.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&& Nb; "Right, our captain stipulates that we must explain our program and treatment before recruiting new people. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Program? Your captain is a bit interesting... Klein deliberately softens his tension to test whether the opponent will take the opportunity to attack.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black cloak man smiled easily:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Before the program, then I will talk about treatment. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This guy is very arrogant... Although it is not an "audience", Klein can also judge that the other person is very confident and does not take the scene in front of him seriously. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We don't have a weekly salary, no annuity, but as long as we find the treasure and plunder the wealth, it will be distributed according to the status. Under normal circumstances, luck is still When it's not bad, the lowest level of sailors can also be divided into two or three hundred pounds a year. I heard that this is on land, equivalent to middle class? Oh, if you can find the ‘sinking Laurel’, all of us will become rich! "The black cloak man casually introduced, "Depending on the status, there are different days of holidays every month, but they can only accumulate together and stagger the rest. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he spoke, he suddenly whispered a curse: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shit, the year before was because the captain was on vacation, we missed the best to find the 'ghost empire' Opportunity!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pirates still have annual leave? Klein was a bit surprised at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He only felt that the pirate group described by the other party revealed a strong and funny atmosphere, reminding him of the spoofed Somali pirates who had seen it in his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing each other seems to be scared by their own words, the black cloak man smiled and added:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As an adventurer, are you still chasing the legendary forces that transcend nature?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As long as you join us, you have a chance! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, he coughed a bit:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Forget yourself. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His expression turned serious, no longer as witty as before:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Iceberg Lieutenant General's subordinate to Edwina Edwards, the fourth sailor of the 'Golden Dream', Flame Daniz. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After reporting the nickname, real name, and identity, Daniz patiently waited for the other person's expression of panic and fear.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a second, he heard that the adventurer with a sinister appearance and a slightly crazy action was quiet and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Golden 3000 pounds of 'flame' Daniz? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz just wants to answer, and suddenly there is an illusion that the other person's incarnation in the dark alley becomes hard to describe, full of hunger The monster is coveting his own soul and flesh and blood.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danizi clenched his fist and lost his body, and the body was slightly shuddered. Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His inspiration tells him that he is facing an abyss full of madness and bloodthirsty!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In this state, Daniz does not know how much time has passed until the other party opens again:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why are you here? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I, I am on vacation..." "The Flame" Daniz's dignity made him disdain to answer this question, but the instinct made him spit out the reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, he felt the other's eyes closed, and the hunger that bites his flesh and soul disappeared.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood in the same place, watching the young adventurer wearing a black coat, wearing a half-high silk hat, turned his body and went to the other side of the alley, Stop at the corner, half-headed road: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where is the 'white shark'? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He, he lives on No. 1 Haidi Avenue, but most of the time he will stay on the second floor of 'Flying Fish and Wine', and today is the same. "Flame" Daniz answered the other party's question truthfully.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the figure disappeared in the distance, Daniz straightened his back and pulled it down. Cloak.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A terrible guy..." He sighed silently.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he I found my thoughts and said to myself in my heart: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I must inform the captain that there is a terrible guy at sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a guy who looks like a gentleman and is like a madman. If you don't have to kill him with determination and grasp, it's best not to deal with him." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz pulled up the hat of the black cloak and decided to go back to the hotel to sleep, waiting for the telegraph office to open the door tomorrow morning and pass the information to the middle liaison who lived in the Rothde Islands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the "white shark", he does not care at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the corner of another secluded street, Klein stood in the shadows and looked down at the black gloves on his left palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He found that "squirming hunger" was sealed by Mr. Azick, but the desire for flesh and soul still exists in the essence and tries show out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under normal circumstances, Klein is not worried about what will happen to the sealed item, but when he himself has the urge to kill, it will be affected accordingly. So that the hunger that can counteract itself is filled. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just now, when he heard that the other party was a famous big pirate on the reward list, the soul that had long been craving had an instant killing and letting "squirming hunger" It is as active as a fish getting water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, Klein has always had good self-control in this regard, judging from the previous words of the other party that he is not the kind of sinful pirate. Easily converge on the inner impulse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "With 'squirming hunger', there is no loophole in the people of Galman Sparo..." Klein slowed for a few seconds, 掏A gold coin was produced, and even two divinations were made. One was whether the "flame" Daniz was lying, and the other was whether the "white shark" Hamilton could cause harm to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first revelation revealed that "flame" Daniz does not need to lie, and the second time shows that "White Shark" Hamilton can not cause harm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein put away the gold coins and slipped his palms while pressing the hat, stroking the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He instantly changed his appearance, blonde blue eyes, ordinary facial features! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, Klein untied the button on the coat and pulled the shirt inside, so that it was no longer tied in the pants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simple changes have changed. After wearing, Klein’s forehead without a cane sweats, and the lips dry out to identify the direction and return to the “Flying Fish and Wine” bar! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the road, he once again met the "flame" Daniz, the other party just looked at him, he took back his sight and went to the hotel on the other side of the bar. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After examining the wall of the reward, Klein calmly reached out, pushed the door open and walked in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, it’s less than ten minutes before he escaped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lot of guests scattered in the bar, but there are many drunks around here to watch the fun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their eyes brushed to the new guests, but they recovered again, and Klein went all the way to the bar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw the bartender standing beside a fat man with a scary white bandage on his forehead, a soft paper on his nostrils, and a lot of silt on his face. green. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man is tall and big, and his skin is white, as if the real white shark swam to the land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He touched his shiny bald head, wearing a dark red coat on the other side, with the captain’s straight sword, Elland Road:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Someone told me that you know the guy just now?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are three ships arriving in Hong Kong today, strangers Foreigners don't have too much, don't try to lie! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aerlan took a hilt and smiled easily:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, He is my passenger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But today's problem is clearly on your people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, I I just want him to come back here, apologize to me and compensate the damaged bar." The tall white fat man frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aylanhaha smiled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"White shark, my hometown has such a proverb, Don't hate the passing wild dogs because of the mice in the warehouse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...justland, this is your attitude?" "White Shark" Hamilton narrowed his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
