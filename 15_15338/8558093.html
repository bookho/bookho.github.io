			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is, what do you suspect? Klein looked straight at Edwina's eyes, did not look away, no flashing dodge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Know is there after knowing that Daniz has revealed his sacrifice to Cavi Tuva before he died. The corresponding preparation, if it is not standing on the ship's side, but sitting on the sofa, he will definitely pick up his right leg and lean back, giving calm and calm answers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled a little on his face, raised his left palm, and introduced his voice easily:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "My gloves are called 'squirming hunger'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein believes that Daniz, who has witnessed his own battle, must have informed him of the specific details. Captain, so, and "Hurricane Lieutenant" Qilingus also called "Iceberg Lieutenant" Edwina is not difficult to guess that he has obtained "squirming hunger", in this case, the initiative revealed more obvious than being exposed by the other party Can occupy a psychological advantage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he suddenly mentioned that this matter contains two meanings. One is to tell the other person concealedly, there is an organization behind me, one can kill the "Hurricane Lieutenant" "Director Kavitova's fall and replace it with the believer's organization. Second, warn Edwina, don't try to investigate, don't delve into it. Otherwise, the "Hurricane Lieutenant" is the second example of being spiked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Klein still took care of the people of German Sparrow, did not directly threaten, nor did he swear, but one The plain statement contains a crazy statement and a simple response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edvina. Edwards gently decapitated and suddenly shifted the topic:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I I intend to provide some assistance to the Rebels in the Rothde Islands, mainly food and cloth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aid? Is the power behind her hostile to Lun, or is she simply thinking of a disgusting storm church? Klein converges with a smile and calmly answers:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This has nothing to do with me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I Will not leave a little handle... He silently added a sentence in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edwina leaned over her head and raised her arms to point to the "flame" Daniz in this direction while drinking:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will entrust him with full authority, including contacting the Rebels, determining the time, and arranging private ports. I hope that you can provide some protection."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;噗...Deniz’s mouth spewed a golden waterfall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;haha, hey, hey! The two pirates sitting next to him smiled and bent over to pick up the deck and spit out the beer they just drank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have a deep complexion, like a layer of iron, a thick waist, although the whole is not fat, but there is no line at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edwina took back the sight of the past and made a quick and unsatisfactory sentence before Klein’s opening:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are an adventurer, I don't think you will reject the good price."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is really a good job for me. The excuse... Klein smiled and replied: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not ask the other person What is the reward, Edwina seems to have forgotten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This intellectually beautiful pirate general has a moment of silence:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Senior makes people It was reported that he was willing to pay 5,000 pounds to buy the key that belonged to the giant that I had discovered before."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means being promoted as the "key of death" Almost, let Daniz lose the huge black iron key in Baiyam. Klein suspected that it not only originated from the dark Second Age, but also had a certain relationship with the giant Wang Ting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The implication is to ask me if I want to pay a price? Klein was a glimpse, and suddenly he couldn't help but groan in his heart: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"5000 pounds? I don't know if the key can be used, Is it really related to the giant Wang Ting! If not, can you return it?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And this information has no pre-positional information. Even if you get divination on the fog, you can't get effective revelation.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, a simple The reasoning is that if you don't involve the giant Wang Ting, it involves another treasure that I don't even know. Then I can't use it if I buy it. The only advantage is that it destroys the plot of 'blood on the top' and hurts others. If you are involved in the giant Wang Ting, 'the blood will be 'even if you buy the past, there is a high probability that you can not find the target location, because that is in the 'land of God', and my plan is to hunt him, then, no need to spend money Being able to get the key is equivalent to helping him buy it and keep it for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This idea is ideal, but it is not impossible to achieve..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Klein has been indulging for a few seconds: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It may contain a lot of secrets."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp He deliberately put forward such a sentence, so that "Iceberger Lieutenant" could not bear to sell the huge black iron key to "the blood will be" Seignor, lest the latter in the first case is fast because of the treasure Strengthening, stepping into the semi-god field, it will bring no small disaster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edwina listened quietly, did not continue this topic, half turned and pointed to the cabin entrance:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Prepare for breakfast."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you." Klein took off his hat and took a gift. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the way to the "Iceberg Lieutenant" to the cabin, he quickly relived the conversation just now, looking for the real thing that Edwina invited to come over to see him. intention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From the identity issue of German Sparrow, to the magical items suspected of 'squirming hunger', to the sacrifice to Caviteu and The fallen 'Poseidon' is still responding to believers, and these things are strung together, and it is really easy to think of a hidden, unknown organization behind me.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "And the "Bingshan Lieutenant" belongs to the forces that are very alert and very interested in this, so let her face the interview to find out about me, see if there is any gain? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are still more kind, and providing assistance to the rebels is an expression. It seems to be more inclined to cooperate with the organization behind me to a certain extent. Of course, Unknown is always frightening. If you don't know enough, you can't grasp it. 'The Iceberg Lieutenant' may be very low and low.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, if They know that the secret organization behind me has only been established for more than half a year. Counting the 'world' and Miss Hugh, who has established contact but never pulled in, no more than ten members, will they be angry and directly out of control... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the thought room, Klein entered the cabin and walked through a dimly lit aisle between a wooden door.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He followed Edwina to the ladder and came to the brighter second floor.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before entering the pirate restaurant, They passed a half-open room.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein sneaked in Eyes, I found that the huge black iron key was placed on a wooden table so casually.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the proof of the harvest of our previous treasure hunt, they have It’s just a commemoration, and some haven’t shown their value yet, and they have to be studied. "A De Wenna seems to be cold, but the explanation is very detailed. It is very afraid that the other party can't understand. I don't understand the spirit of what happened.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When referring to the word "research", her light blue eyes like a clear spring are obviously brighter.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proof of the treasure hunt? Klein couldn't help but look into the inside.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Edwina took the initiative to push the door more open, went in, introduced casually道:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the gold coin of the Solomon Empire of the Quaternary. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein's gaze turned and saw a coin placed in the frame.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;It is dark gold overall, as if it consists of two semi-circles of inconsistent size, extremely asymmetrical, its surface is engraved with a pointed crown, and the top of the "King of the Five Seas" Nast head Very similar.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edwina is like a master who likes to show off her collection, and introduces the items in the room in turn, which makes Klein think of an acquaintance, that is, the "eye of wisdom" old gentleman, big detective Essinger Stanton . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At the point of showing off the collection, they are very similar...Is there such a good person in the collection? Wait, Mr. Stanton went to study in Rumburg. After four years, the description of 'Iceberg Lieutenant' also includes 'Edvina Edwards from Rømberg', which is the capital of the Church of Knowledge and Wisdom, and Mr. Stanton has acknowledged I changed my letter to the 'King of Knowledge and Wisdom' during my study abroad... Isn't the power behind the 'Iceberg Lieutenant' is them?” Klein listened thoughtfully until Edwina stopped at the huge one. Iron black key before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As seen in previous dreams, this key is as big as a lyre, and normal humans have to hold it, and the whole is dull and ancient. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surface pattern is similar to the style of Silver City, with obvious giant characteristics... Klein nodded and was about to look back, but heard Aide Wen Na said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can study it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me study? You probably don't know how many potential problems I have detonated. Let me let go of the research. I am afraid that I can't see the "Golden Dream" when I wait... Klein spoke two words, stretched out his right hand and reached out to that. Put the black iron key belonging to the giant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He only feels cold, no matter how infused with spirituality, it has no effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, you can’t take it directly to the fog... Klein retracted his right hand and shook his head invisibly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He moved his eyes and saw the book on the same table with this parchment. The dark brown cover had a line of ancient Fossack: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grossel Travels<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This comes from a submarine shipwreck, soaked In 165 years, there is still no damage,” Edwina said. “It tells a story. A giant named Grosell decided to go to the country of frost to hunt the 'King of the North', a powerful ice giant. On the way, he met a companion, a female elf, a devout monk, a Roman emperor, and a soldier from Lun. The story just progressed to their positive encounter with the 'King of the North' but suddenly stopped, not to say No, but the next few pages are difficult to open in a variety of ways, you can give it a try."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a travel-type note, but a novel? This novel is quite strange. Putting together the roles of different eras and different eras, it should be a modern product... Klein flipped the book and let the yellow sheet of paper slip through. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The content inside is not much different from that described by Edwina, but the storyline is very awkward and full of splitting, always let Klein wonder if he is Look less for a while, for example, the protagonists have become familiar with strangers after encountering them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, he browsed through the last few pages and found that they were really stuck together and couldn’t be opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This effect should be handled above the fog... I don’t know what will happen... Kline looks sideways at the "Iceberger" . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edwina silently said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you want, I can sell For you, I have been studying for many years, still have no gains.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But I have a condition. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What conditions? Klein asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edwina snorted:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What have you studied, please be sure to tell me the results, so that I am no longer confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as you agree to this condition, I can sell it to you very cheaply."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Klein suddenly had an interest:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How much?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"8000 pounds." Aide Wenna said calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
