			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dangdang! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein rode a few bikes on the lawn behind his house on a bicycle that Repad had just completed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not bad, as I expected, but there is no need to make a rattle alone. When the situation is met, it is difficult for the rider to pull out his hand. The bell can be combined with the handlebars, which is more convenient and simpler and more in line with the development of things.” Klein squeezed the brakes with his right hand, making the bicycle slow down quickly and stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, he put the rattle in his left hand back to his original position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Repard contemplates a few seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, it should be like this, I am just pure Imitate the carriage rattle and forget that we are a brand new means of transportation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, he looked at Klein skillfully and got off the bus. Get the support:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The feeling you gave me was that you used to ride a similar vehicle and ride very well... I am sure that the market is not good. There are big flaws in the bicycles, and there is a clear difference between this and my car."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Share a bicycle to learn about it... As a "clown", I should actually ride a wheelbarrow Klein silently spoke a few words, slightly smiling: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This has nothing to do with experience, excellent balance and athletic ability is the key.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately opened the topic: "But listening to your introduction, the cost is quite high, and there is no contradiction between the positioning of our products, you must Fast to come up with solutions to reduce costs, you know, aristocratic, wealthy and so there is the identity of the gentry certainly would not choose their ride, this disgraceful, more than 300 pounds in the middle class, too. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Our goal is a small staff member, a postman, a so-called worker aristocrat, that is, a class between 70 and 300 pounds. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is just a 'prototype', um, the words invented by Russell the Great, the cost is normal, and if the subsequent factoryization is smooth, I think It is not a problem to get below 6 pounds. If you can find cheap materials that can replace natural rubber, it is even better. This is the most expensive part. Repard replied with long thoughts.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, the world has not found oil...I don’t know if there is...the refined coal tar can Instead of it, does it play a role in this? I don’t understand at all, I am neither learning this line nor a generalist... Klein thought: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the cost can be controlled below 4 pounds, then we will get rich. As for the cheap materials to replace natural rubber, you can go over the Russell manuscript, maybe he has a certain idea. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Repard gently "hmm" and suddenly said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" From this incident, I only thought that there will be a memorial exhibition of Russell the Great next week, just in the Kingdom Museum! Organized by steam and mechanical churches, it is said that there will be original inventions and various relics of Russell the Great. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inventing manuscripts and various relics? Klein listened with enthusiasm and immediately asked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "What time is it? I am very interested. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Next Tuesday to next Friday, every day from 9 am to 6 pm, although Russell was once the enemy of the kingdom, but his legendary life Charm will not weaken a bit. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will take the time to see this exhibition. Klein swelled his bulging wallet and took two 10 pounds and two 5 pounds of banknotes. "This is the second installment. You use it to study how to reduce costs and do the most complete work at the patent office." Apply, if you don't have a familiar lawyer, I can introduce one. The last 20 pounds will be given to you next week to find new investors and complete the factoryization of the products. Of course, I will also help people who are interested. . "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not think about the profit of monopoly bicycles, first of all, the lack of money for large-scale production, and secondly, he did not think that he had three parts in the factory, promotion and sales. Enough people, barely doing or hiring people, time-consuming and laborious is not necessarily successful, and may even lose money. In this case, it is better to introduce new investors with similar resources and channels, professional things to let professional people do.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the more important point is that, in this way, he has the opportunity to realize a certain amount of shares in advance, and accumulate part of the cash for the resources needed to promote the “no face to face”, so as not to encounter the money but not the money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I have never thought of being a bicycle tycoon. I am sensitive and become a "faceless person" before I can stay away from things that may become social focus... I Will play "magic", not "businessman" and "factory owner"... Klein lamented two words in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know several lawyers." Repped muttered and took the second investment. "Why don't you go to the bank to apply for a loan? To patents, I believe there are certain banks that will lend us money, such as Beckland Bank, such as Bhaut Bank."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We introduced more than just Investment, as well as channels, relationships and abilities, understand?” Klein explained with a smile, then put on his hat. “When you apply for a patent, send a letter to me, you know my address.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the sea in Sonia, there is an island with an extinct volcano. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A row of masts with sails hanging on them, filled with the not-so-small dock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pirates’ voices, snoring, laughter, roar, cheers, and endlessness make it seem like a sea of ​​carnival. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Inverted" Alger Wilson walked down the "Blue Avenger" and climbed the cliff not far away, quietly looking at it all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Besides the four kings and the seven generals, the other pirates were the ones who got the event a week ago, and most of them simply couldn’t catch up. In the defense of the navies of the national navies and the major churches." Alger spirit did not concentrate on watching the pirates move out of a barrel of ale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that the Kingdom of Lun already has an epoch-making ironclad ship, but he is not worried that he will meet here because it has only passed four months, and in propaganda The invincible fleet also needs more armored ships. It needs different types of ships to cooperate. It needs to train officers, sailors and gunners. Without more than one year, it will not form a real combat power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the occasion of the distraction of Alger's thoughts, the pirates on the ships and the pier suddenly screamed, some rushed to the depths of the island, and some rushed to control The boat, away from the dock, is like avoiding demons and plagues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In just a few minutes, the lively scenes were left with nothing but silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger turned his head to the sea and saw a ship painted in black, with a huge white skull painted with a skull on its mast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The skull is dark and the blue flame is burning in the eye socket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Black Death..." Alger whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He understands why the pirates had to avoid it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The disease will be" where Trey is passing, there will always be someone who is inexplicably sick! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Black Death" slowly landed, wearing a white linen shirt, wearing a dark red coat appeared in the bow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a pretty beautiful lady, but also a very energetic lady. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her black and charming curls are high up, wrapped around a white headscarf, and her legs are fitted with beige trousers. The shape is slender, but there is no shortage of wonderful men. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most attractive thing for this lady is the long, straight eyebrows and sharp, bright blue eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between her hopes, the blind man occasionally loses the focal length, which is fascinating and extraordinarily attractive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bard who was caught in a pirate did not know when he came to the edge of the cliff, with a sly tone:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is always a girl."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She really brought the disease, hey, I am sick, in my mind It’s all her.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
