			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meat quality of the barbed fish is definitely not comparable to that of the fisherman, but the variety of spices is not chaotic, and the layered features still make Klein quite admirable. I still want to eat if I eat it, I can’t stop it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, there are really extraordinary people in the local area who want to withdraw from the dangerous circle. If you live a normal life, you can go to Bakerland to open a Rothde-style restaurant. The grilled fish is inclusive in the metropolis, and the business is definitely not bad. The only problem is that the price of many spices is definitely not as cheap as this one, the cost will be high, and the target group has to be positioned well..." Klein put down the pair For the rough chopsticks, while wiping the mouth with a napkin, I was thinking about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his view, many times the civilians can’t find a way to get rich because the eyesight is not enough, but the eyesight is confined to the education they receive. And the daily experience, bound by the hierarchy, is really difficult to jump out. To break this limitation, it is the most effective way to try to pursue a better and higher level of education, and secondly, dare to take risks and sway everywhere. Of course, this is a big risk, and many people are dying on this road without a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This meal, Klein used 2 Sule 5 pence, the price is not cheap, but in terms of food, he has always been willing to spend money, and the most recent major The overhead has been contracted by Daniz. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pulling the collar and putting on the hat, he took the black cane and walked out of the old John's restaurant, just to see a police officer driving the wanderer on the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The indigenous people of the Rothde Islands, the skin color is deeper than that of the southern continent, close to the bronze that often basks in the sun, their hair is mainly dark black, all Natural micro-volumes are no different from the colonists of the Kingdom of Lun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This place was completely colonized for less than 50 years. Originally, Lun worked with the Aboriginal Chiefs in the name of the Central Indonesian company to extract economic benefits, but later The management of the Central Indonesian company was quickly corrupted, fighting for power, even provoking the enemy for personal gains, and starting the war. The most ridiculous thing is that they also reported to each other that the competitors accepted bribes. To this end, they each looked for the members behind them. When the House meets, they attack each other and almost go to court. (Note 1)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The local indigenous people can’t imagine that they can make the prince’s chief squat down, kiss the upper, and send a car and a car gift. The big man, in Beckland, is a small role that is not a member of the Lian. - Although most of them come from aristocratic families, the inheritance is very late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the dispute, the king reached an agreement with the Prime Minister to redeem the stock, end the Central Sunia Company, send the fleet and the military to fully occupy the Rothde Islands, and implement True colonial rule. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, the rule of the archipelago is the Governor’s Office, the Parliament and the Court, and the top ranks all belong to the Lun, and some of the middle, parliamentary and magistrate’s judges are The original descendants of the princes of the princes, the ground floor is open to the local educated indigenous people, including the police officers below the police. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one who wields a short stick and drives the tramp is a local policeman. His goal is also to have the obvious characteristics of Rothde. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seeing a double-breasted long dress, wearing a half-high silk hat and Klein looking at the black civilization, the police immediately put away the short stick. Stand straight, close your legs and do a trick:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Noon, sir.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you need any help? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein feels a bit complicated and gently nods:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no carriage here?" ? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Governor's Office stipulates that this street is not allowed to enter the carriage, you must go to the street ahead. The policeman said with trepidation and enthusiasm.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Thank you. Klein casually praised, "Your Lun speaks well." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police surprise was a little excited:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think, I think, this is done A must-have, a must-have quality for a policeman. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein secretly vomited and slowly walked to the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw along the way that the local clothing style is very different from the mainland cities such as Beckland and Tingen, and even the ports of Damir and Banxi, which have been colonized for more than two hundred years. It’s not the same:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decent people from Lun are wearing gowns, wearing high hats, bow ties, carrying civilization sticks, so that the people around them are unassuming, no Dare to look straight, dare not touch, the rest of the indigenous or mixed-race, like the jacket-style thick coat with wide-leg loose pants, plus the cap from the mainland, do not like black, advocating brown, brown and light gray, for Klein, This is indeed a bit weird, but it also gives him the feeling of coming to foreign countries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the higher-status indigenous and mixed-blooded are also imitating the wearing of the Lun people, thinking that this is the expression of civilization. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 pm, "Swordfish Bar", recognized adventurer Assembly point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time there were not many alcoholic guests, and Klein easily passed through a table and arrived at the bar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He found that the most different thing here is that there are three blackboards supported by wooden frames on the side of the bar, with a white sheet of yellow The notice, the contents are varied, strange, there are hired bodyguards, there are requests to help find people, there is a survey of the situation of an island, there is a high price reward for a pirate head, but also claimed that they have obtained a treasure map, want to form a team In short, the affairs that have been divided by private detectives and security companies in the Kingdom of Lun are still adventurous here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A cup of Zarha." Klein knocked on the surface of the bar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a local malt beer, cheap, good flavor, loved by adventurers, Klein from the "flame" Daniz mouth know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"3pence." The bartender glanced at the guests at random, and there was no change in attitude due to the strangeness of the other face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After getting the beer, Klein sat on the high chair in front of the bar, snoring in a small mouth and quietly listening to the chat with the surrounding alcoholic To find valuable goals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After nearly an hour, the number of bar guests increased, and Klein finally heard a topic that might be useful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is energetic and more focused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was four people sitting at the table less than 3 meters from him, and he was deploring a man named Winter:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I always thought that Wenter went out to sea. I didn't expect that he was at home and was very ill."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"唉, if I knocked on the door two days earlier, and he wouldn't die. You don't know how terrible the room is. There are mushrooms on his body, one piece, white."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dog! Don't tell me! Didn't you see me eating sausage?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, Winter The room is full of insects, moths, flies, butterflies, bees, cockroaches, storms, I can't believe this is where humans live, the police coming back is scared!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sentence of conversation passed into the ear, Klein frowned slightly, feeling Winter The death is not normal. After a few days of death, the body is full. Mushrooms, the room is still flying with a variety of insects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Related to an extraordinary event? This level of anomalies, the police will certainly report to the "deceased" team... It sounds like three or four days ago, the processing should be done... Klein seriously consider whether to look at it At least the man named Winter, who was alone in Baiyam as an adventurer, did not have any companions who wanted to pass on his death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listening for a long time, he initially grasped the place where Winter rented, just in the nearby apartment at No. 47, Heijiao Street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
