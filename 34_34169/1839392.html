Of course, he knows that the Manchester Medical School will be where he will stay for four or more years: "This is not a secret, it is not open."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "They married God." The boy with a demon name said. "Crime is the root of mankind," his best friend and brother said: "The ancestors of mankind have stolen fruit from the tree of wisdom - their descendants It was born from the crime."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The street lights on both sides of the road flashed twice and opened, and the gentle yellowish ochre lights blew past them like a breeze. The body of the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A body crouching in the grass was awkwardly moved, causing the attention of Besib. "It's a bit familiar," he said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is my roommate, called Richard White." Sasha said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard. White looked up and looked at them in a panic, he brought his eyes, a big flesh-colored border, black legs, eyes Enlarged by the lens: "Good evening, Sasha." He groaned and looked at Sasha and looked at Besib. The appearance of Besib made him a little bit afraid. He was already taller than ordinary adult males. The muscles of the body can be seen even in a jacket: "You too... good evening," he stuttered, reaching out to grab the base of the streetlight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you need a favor?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No...no, thank you," he Say: "I still have a little more to finish. If I stand up now, my calf will be very painful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing? Besib asked, he took two steps forward, and Richard White suddenly screamed and scared him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't stop don't..." Richard said hard. Because he had to shrink the abdomen when he shouted out the word, he was squatting: "Be careful!" He paled and eagerly waved a hand forward - the strange thing was that his feet didn't move: "Be careful with those Snail."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib bowed his head, and at his feet, the two snails were carrying their colorful shells and swaying their translucent tentacles on the plane of the stone bricks - looking like some undiscovered new species. But no matter what kind of new type of snail, it will not carry a pattern on the body like the shell of the Manchester school badge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am coloring the snail." Richard probably used all his courage in just a few seconds, he said The voices of the voices became low and vague: "There will be people who don't accidentally step on them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishb looks at those who have One-fourth of his big palm snails looked at them and found that the patterns on them were different. Some were dark blue background with golden anchors, and some were three-color or four-color rainbows. Some are colored, some are camouflage, some are big sharks, zebra stripes and faces, and there are a few cans of acrylic paint under the bench against the streetlight. Richard White had a paint brush in his hand that he could see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No wonder he always smells the oil before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your roommate is an environmentalist?" asked Besib. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone on the Western continent is now an environmentalist."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You understand I mean, I mean, radical animal protectionists?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Probably a little," Sasha said, remembering those animals with human eyes. "But I don't know if it is radical."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His smell is very bad," Besib said: "It feels full of mold spots. And dry up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, you are biased against him.",<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe Because he has a relationship with my position."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fair. I have not attacked your roommate."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's because Quinta is not bad, but this guy, I am worried that he will get up in the middle of the night to add some chemical additives to your shared water dispenser."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“General chemical additives are useless to us.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Poseidon Island people can never think that the attempt is worthy of discretion "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay..." standing in their common living room. Sasha couldn't help but grabbed the shoulders of Besib. He knew that Besib. Bissand had been a little nervous since he was separated from him. Yes, they are also one room in Poseidon and Grande, but Now, or as Besib said. Another person shared his friends with him - many boys would indeed be friends with people who lived in the same room because they were too close. It will be a painful and dangerous thing to become an enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But we are not friends," Sasha said. "We are brothers." He smiled. Pinch the neck of Besib: "Do you think Quinta or anyone else can be your brother?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait for hell to freeze "It's impossible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Very correct," Hopkins said. "You know very well - your uneasiness is because we finally got rid of the sea god island - Here, it’s too far from Poseidon Island.” He’s not referring to distance, but because of Manchester, a place full of power and wealth in the future, than Sangdi and Hopkins can reach one or two fingers, but This will cause a lot of people's uneasiness, and their uneasiness can be directly poured into Masoye and the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the two dads have taken a wait-and-see attitude and a conservative attitude together, but fortunately these two children are big enough, don’t need to say, even if it is Sasha Hopkins is already a character that cannot be underestimated - he never kills, really, in the dark world, doing this is harder than killing people, but no one dares to provoke him. Not only because he is standing behind the mulberry, but also because this little blond boy who is very hands-on, once started, will lead to a hundred times worse than the original possible - he has the hot and spicy of the Poseidon The patience and patience that the people of Poseidon did not have (Bessib had ridiculously called it "mother"), he was interested in everything, especially good at "ask" those savage villains - he used to be a hostile family The iron hoe talked for a while, then the guy not only said what they wanted to know, but also cried when he saw someone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, Old Andriana had not even cooked a pot of coffee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the people he handled were still alive, but everyone who had seen them agreed that they were still dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib didn’t talk, Sasha Hopkins was always sharp – he remembered the little boy who took off his pants and proved that he was not a girl . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a bit...not comfortable, he has wanted to get rid of the shackles of Poseidon Island many times. But when he really got out of its arms, he felt cold and trembled. At this time, Hopkins, who had always been inseparable from him since he was a child, lived with others, and replaced him with a dark-skinned stranger. Although Besib does not hate him, it is difficult to let go of his intimate vigilance and alertness. In the first few nights, he didn't fall asleep—plus the pressure outside of school and school, even Besib, a versatile person, felt a little exhausted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha should feel something, so he would be invited to complete the extra "homework", which is one of the best ways to relax. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now Sasha Hopkins simply poked it out, which is a good thing for Besib. The pressure accumulated over the past two months is like a slow exit that has found an exit. His father is still watching him, and his brother is just two walls apart, and his roommate, if he is really I know what Biebu. Bisangdi is. Then you can't sleep, you will become him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is really funny, whether it is Quinta or himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But we still have friends, that's why we have to leave here at Poseidon Island," said Bessie, who calmed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha nodded and agreed: "Quinta will not be your brother, but he can be your friend - Chekale. Friends, his success often comes from this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was already late for Chaw White to return to the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The animals stared at him with human eyes. He used paints containing luminous ingredients to paint the colorful irises, which looked very bright in the dark. The meager skylight stretches out a thin tentacles from the thick curtain gap. Casting on the blanket of his roommate, he seemed to be asleep, looking calm. Both hands are placed outside the blanket and the posture is correct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard didn't take a bath, just wiped the body with a wet towel - it was purely personal, his mother didn't bathe him, because putting bath water was a very troublesome and wasteful thing, in order to avoid odor on his body. . She wiped her body with a wet towel dampened with perfume, just like the nobles of the fifteenth century. She said this, giggling - she would only ask him cold in front of people. Innocent, people's appreciation of the eyes will make her body fluttering, but as he grew up, these tricks did not work, she began to nitrite on his biscuits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stole her powder and sprinkled it all into the white brandy coffee of Cha Lisi. White, for which he didn’t have a panic and awkwardness, he She also closed the door of the box and covered Chris's head with a pillow, lest her call for help be heard by outsiders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the whole process, he followed the teachings of the respectable doctor and hid the cd in his clothes. He still remembers the hard state. The cold metal touches the feeling of your stomach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lost his mother and became an orphan, but he was adopted very quickly. That person was a doctor’s patient, and he also suffered from The doctor's favor, so he is willing to give a little effort, Richard White has a rich and safe growing environment, but in the past two years, excessive intake of nitrite affected his body and IQ. Development, he is a weak and small in school, looks ordinary, introverted gloomy, no matter which aspect is not worth mentioning - fortunately he has a doctor, the doctor inspired his talent in painting, this The talent hides all his shortcomings and makes him radiant, even Manchester's demanding and highly recruiting officials are not immune to its temptation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An admirer has deliberately opened a gallery filled with his work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But these are not the concerns of Richard White. He just wants to know if the doctor is proud of him... Of course, he knows that the doctor has a son, but he He will not marry him, because he loves doctors, and the things that doctors love are all he loves. He will follow the doctor's arrangement and become another credible arm of Sasha Hopkins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he is so beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ricture draws plants, draws stones, draws rivers, draws animals, draws insects, but he never paints people, and people who are jealous think he can't draw people . Only Richard White knew that he didn't paint because most people are too ugly, and there is no way for him to raise his pen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You seem to have forgotten me." Richard said in his heart: "But it doesn't matter, we can start over."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened himself in the bathroom The laptop sent a short email to Dr. Hopkins, who was far away from Poseidon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doctors deleted the email and closed his laptop . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that everything is fine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manchester is not Grand. It is impossible to allow dangerous people like Anthony Hopkins to become a member of the school, and because of the war, Anthony Hopkins finally recovered after he reached adulthood and should inherit from his father and grandfather. His property, he did not study and further study in Manchester, so he is not always able to enter and leave Manchester's old alumni, he can only manage to arrange a credible person to stay with Sasha. Richard White is a good helper. His brain may be a bit slow, but loyal enough, and his talents ensure that he can get a Manchester admission letter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s still not a matter of keeping up with Mr. Hopkins’s mind, maybe a cup of absinthe is a good choice. He found the wine and the cup, but there was no sugar. He went downstairs and went to the kitchen to find it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Andreas is collecting and wiping the entire set of silver cutlery, those silverware cutlery engraved in ancient times can be done in Chekal. The great-grandfather, who was said to be part of a ransom paid by a respectable cardinal, came to visit the Governor but was warmly hosted by the Sangdi family for a whole month. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cold or hot?" asked Old Andriana. It takes a spoon to drink cold, because cold water needs to pass through the sugar cubes placed on the spoon and penetrate into the absinthe. Throw the sugar cubes directly into the absinthe, then immediately pour cold water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give me a spoon," Hopkins said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Andreas handed over a flat spoon with a name engraved on the end of the spoon, which may be a baptismal gift, the name above is baptized Child's. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doctor placed the spoon of the sugar cube on the absinthe glass when he was about to pour cold water. A swift black shadow slammed down from above. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spoon hits the cup and gives a crisp clang. It jumped up from the cup and looked like a swordfish hooked by a hook. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It stabbed straight to the shadow. The black shadow and it collided in the air, both Old Andrina and Hopkins heard the dull snoring, but it was not like being pierced - the black shadow land was left old Andriana wiped the light on the stainless steel countertop, and the spoon hit the countertop, making a louder impact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God," Old Andriana shouted: "What is this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "One hand," Dr. Hopkins said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a solitary hand, they are familiar with the hand, fat, but the fingers are flexible like oil, nail construction The flat mouth, the ring finger and the thumb are all wearing a ring. It should be dragged with a flesh-colored flat tail where it is connected to the wrist. It stands and jumps against the "tail", and the fingers swayed firmly against the spoon and turned on the table. turn to. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It found the target, the sugar scattered on the table, the spoon fell out, and there was a large plate - that was the old Andriana did not put Going back, it threw away the spoon and threw it on the pile of sugar cubes, cracking a bright red mouth and sucking it greedily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, it seems that you have found it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chegaler Bissan Standing at the door of the kitchen, he said, he was wearing pajamas, his legs quickly melted and stretched out, forming a fine net in the air, accurately holding the little bit of sugar that gave up the rest and preparing to escape again. Right hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter," he said comfortably. "I think it's just a little hungry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; That hand frantically bit the net. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the blood dripping, the net melted again, and with the hand in the net, it retracted, like a rewind lens in the movie. Retracted into the pajamas, Chegal raised the empty sleeves, and the new right hand re-extended from the bare ends, wearing the two rings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
