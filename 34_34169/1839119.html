			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18:28. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head sits on his big, terrible desk, like a boy under the age of fifteen, with one foot and the other hanging Under the table, there was a roll of stuff on his knees that looked like a piece of plastic paper less than a centimeter thick. The size of the "Babel Tower" ruled up at the fingertips, cautiously and carefully Moving above... The plane of the "Babel Tower" is unfolding on this new concept tablet, which is only part of the test article. The place where the red and blue dots flash is opened and the head can be obtained from the ubiquitous monitoring probe. The immediate situation in the place - which is basically in a different degree of chaos, the green means safe and sound, I don't know how long it can last, the gray can't open it - that means the monitoring probe in that area has been damaged ,Not available. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g District is in a dark, seemingly dead, but the head can imagine how lively, the monitoring equipment in the corridor has not been engulfed by fire At the time, he had already seen the poisonous criminal in the 18th room tearing the metal electromagnetic door and the reinforced glass door inside, and took out their little guests. Without much recognition and analysis, he knew that this was the guy, didn't he? Although the face, and the fingerprints and palm prints of ten fingers belong to another person, as long as you look at the arrogant eyes, the means of cleanliness, even if there is a bullet chasing after the ass can maintain the elegance. He also thought that it was the Ghoul, Anthony Hopkins, who had a noble blood and belonged to the demons of the last century. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head took a candy from his pocket, peeled the sugar paper and stuffed it into his mouth. It was a lemon sandwich and his head was sour. Lips and eyebrows - he was deeply surprised that he had not been able to pick this snake out of the grass in the first place. Fortunately, this did not constitute a crime or a handle. The institution was established for a long time, but it was still fresh. It has not been allowed to occupy a position that is too important for the bureaucracy, such as the FBI or the state legislature. The above people will not care about one or two small mistakes. As long as they can be recovered in time, the head believes that they can do it— —Anthony Hopkins is indeed an awkward guy. The intelligence department thought he could pinch his tail through an “anaesthetist”. Who knows that he actually in turn tempted them to make a completely wrong judgment through the same person – no After another investigation, the head can already be sure that the sudden attack half an hour ago was a bait thrown by the ghoul, but he still couldn’t understand the change. Why did the doctor want to let a large group of high-risk action members Full of blood Followed by a corpse and a doll running around... It’s no good for him to trigger an alarm – in the case of such a situation, the g zone will first be completely blocked, and its solidity will never be inferior to the world’s largest vault, ten minutes. Of course, others can't go in and stop him from getting his children out of the room, but in the same way, he doesn't want to get out of it. Ten minutes later, the periphery of the g zone will be spread over the members of the action group and the guards of the guns. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The information that the "anaesthetist" gave him absolutely included this part. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What exactly does this bastard want to do? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head peeled another piece of toffee again, the soft candy rolled between the tongue and the teeth, and the saliva quickly made it sticky, he bite open It found that this is a durian sandwich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s awful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flame flaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire sprinklers on the ceiling are constantly rotating to spray cold, transparent dots, which meet the flames of unknown origin and create a strong mist in the air. Residents of District G, standing cautiously against solid walls, lowered their bodies slightly - instead of squatting in the educational film of a fire escape, that posture might not let them be smog, but it was very They might have a deadly guy on their back or back of the brain—they could see the shadows not far from each other through fog and flames, but at least for the first two or three minutes, no one spoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is tormented by their own desires and strengths, but no one wants to be a victim of others' desire to dispel their desires and exert their strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We have to go out first." Unexpectedly, the first voice is a woman. Her voice was full of tiredness and horror, but it was still very attractive - it made people want to listen to her. "We must leave here first," she said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Hopkins found that she cleverly used two "firsts" in succession, and slightly aggravated their weight in the pronunciation, these two The words seem insignificant, but they are good at directing the attention of these beasts to the aspect she wants – whether it is freedom or her own safety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This can't be done."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Hopkins said, in the other voice In the silence of the fall, the ghoul’s squeaking voice is particularly prominent. This murmur has been there since he spent eight years in silence in a state violent mental hospital, even after that. He has not been able to correct the days that he has been lingering for many years, but the same as the previous female voices, this kind of sound has the charm of trembling and listening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Destroy here, destroy everything," his voice echoed in flames and water vapor: "This is a wonderful thing."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha’s little arm licked his neck and could feel the male’s throat vibrating happily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The father is making a bad boy again, he thinks, and then falls into a deep sleep with peace of mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest is like a wooden board, lying straight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not a veteran of sleeping psychiatric hospitals and prison cots like Dr. Hopkins, but the beds of monasteries and seminaries are hard enough and small, so he It’s also comfortable to sleep in this inconspicuously heated sleeper, although it’s not what he wants to sleep for more than twenty hours a day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agency did not immediately hand him over to the police or the rewards for reasons that could not be made public (if the latter, he will undoubtedly Being smashed by those angry parents), but what deeply afflicts the institution is the priest’s ability, exceptionally powerful, powerful and difficult to suppress – whether it’s a prison or a jealousy, it’s too much for him. Multi-effect, the doctor of the last institution gave him propranolol hydrochloride (one of the b blockers). Unlike other sedatives, the main function of this drug is to lower the heart rate and not enter the brain itself. But because the heart rate slows down, like deep breathing, it shows the brain that a non-stress state predominates—that is, the parasympathetic nervous system is working. Such a neurological division will only begin to operate if we do not need immediate survival as a top priority. It allows humans to relax and digest food without sweating, or to expand the trachea to increase their breathing, and to maintain a high degree of alertness to respond to rapidly changing conditions... in short, it It can make human beings docile, slow, and amiable, like a piece of linen that gradually relaxes under the steam of the iron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No light, no sound, no smell, even the touch has become nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth." The priest whispered in his heart: "The earth is empty and chaotic. The darkness of the earth. The Spirit of God runs on the water... God Say, if there is light, there will be light."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
