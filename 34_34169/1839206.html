			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little party soon ended, and Boa followed Miss Marcia. When she passed by Jane, the assistant doctor gently stopped him: Boa," she said in a gentle voice: "Doctor Douglas wants to talk to you for a while."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bao looked at Miss Marcia from under her eyebrows. Marcia shook her head vigorously: "Go, Boa," she pushed the boy's shoulder: "Come to me at seven o'clock, we have dinner together." She didn't realize that her voice suddenly changed, or Said to return to the extent that can be described as loud. Jane tried to push down the urge to lick her ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This appointment is a good relief for Boa, he sighs like a troubled adult, his hands in the pockets of linen trousers, Follow Jane to the depths of the huge flower garden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Masia watched them leave, the place of the tea party was on the edge of the flowerbed, a narrow, leafy open space, the dark green grass was long and dense, in the middle It grows thyme, mint, musk, large glazed grass and lemongrass that people have just tasted; in the place where they meet the forest, the darker colors of the shrubs are lush, gooseberry, burdock, clam, thorn pear, son-in-law, French holly, myrtle, is said to be able to drive away the elder's elders, most of which are in the flowering period, pink, red, purple and golden ochre flowers gather together intensively, from east to west, continuous, Like a delicate and gorgeous Persian miniature painting; it is difficult to count, and the four-leaf ramie that stretches like a cross is under their feet, covering the land with a little gap, and the shadow cast by the trees above is gradually covering them. - The sun is falling, the aroma of the flowers and the blooming flowers becomes thick and heavy, making people a little breathless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doctor Douglas saw that he didn’t speak when he was a child. He first nodded to Jane. "Thank you, Jane. You can go back and take a break," then he Only turned to his nephew: "Follow me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They walked along the mossy, soft and comfortable small radial direction, Boa heard the sound of water flowing It is the living water that is drawn from the tributary of Grande. It is artificially excavated, and the flowing water in the channel like a spider web. Through human design, their watershed covers the entire garden. At the end of the journey, all the water flows are gathered. Together. In the still unnatural stone pit, a deep and small lake is formed. The bottom of the lake has a dark passage connecting the downstream of the tributary. So even if you encounter heavy rain, you don't have to worry about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Talk about it, dear nephew," Dr. Douglas said. "What have you been doing recently?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In doing bad things," Boa does not think about it. Answer, "My dear uncle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas opened a gray-white branch that blocked the way. Take a few purple-red fruits from the top and put them in your pocket: "Including treating a lady rudely and pushing her to the ground?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regret," Boa said coldly: "I don't think that such a guy can be called a lady - she is slow and just like a sloth - only one of her, always standing where she shouldn't stand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are still targeting Sasha Hopkins." Dr. Douglas calmly pointed out: "My nephew, your recent behavior and thoughts are as childish and ridiculous. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Masia looks at him differently."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What makes you jealous?" Douglas The doctor said: "As a teacher. I think I have to tell you that you are a useless and false emotion. It is of no benefit. It will only make you suffer and feel empty, and..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And, admit, I admit that the guy is stronger than me." Boa quickly picked up, his eyes surging More mature and complex emotions than ever: "He is indeed better than me. Uncle, thank you for your previous reminder, I managed to get his transcript, he will be a very difficult enemy." He broke with disgust A doctor who almost swept to his eyes, Dr. Douglas frowned. "I don't want to tell my father in the second year, I lost to a hybrid of unknown origin - no matter what class or swimming, So I gotta..." He paused: "Preventing problems before they happen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Douglas family motto," Boa sings like a play: "Early Discover, try early, deal with it early, and be safe early.” The young man’s sharp eyes searched for a precocious peach in the dark and deep branches, and immediately stretched his arm to pick it up. The peach was white, only with a pointed A little red, hard and hard, it is not very sweet to eat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then choose a good method," Dr. Douglas glanced gratified at the peach that was thrown on the ground when he took a bite: "Not like a It’s stupid and futile to scream like a young child under three years old to push him, bite him, kick his calf.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am willing to do it the way I do," Boa snorted slyly. "I can beat him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't think you still have More time," Dr. Douglas said. "Tell you a bad news. Hopkins's instructor and ninth grade instructor are preparing to recommend him to apply for a 'Outstanding Diploma' (Note 1), that is, the next semester He is very likely to be a member of the gifted class, just like you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boa’s face sank suddenly, "...I should have You can go to Wellington College, and you, my uncle, you should have been indulging in a chaotic and dirty public hospital, around 365 days a year, around twenty-four hours a day and tramp I’m going to get one or two pitiful green tickets from the tax every month – why do you think you can be here? With a generous salary, work is easy, and there is only one that belongs to you, huge and unimaginable The flower buds... the ungrateful fool," the boy smiled viciously A moment: "My dad got you here because I can get the best care and the most discounts, instead of letting you stand on the side and doing nothing to rush at me - you haven't had the right to direct me, on the contrary, You have to do what I want."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stopped, and after the peach, he started a good double-flowered gardenia, he Pull it off the branch and tear it apart, he knows that his uncle loves the flowers, he just wants him to be upset, because the bad news he brings makes him very upset. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have any way to stop this?" Boa asked irritably, he pulled the gardenia and went to provoke the hook. The hook was not so good, he was stabbed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Quality class qualification? Sorry, even if your father drives me back to a public hospital, I can't reverse the thoughts of two people at the same time. Johnny is fine. Old Cory has always been stubborn and makes people have toothaches, not to mention other teachers, such as... Miss Marcia," Dr. Douglas gently poked like a dangling: "Grandri, excellent athletic performance. The child can be put on the counter as far as I can see. As far as I know, the unconventional Besib. Bissau has an extraordinary talent in rugby, and his coach is also applying - this is not so good, etc. They enter the vision and shelter of the school board, and you can't do anything more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Boa is silent, he knows what his uncle said . The Douglas family has an unusual meaning for the Grande Boarding School, which once belonged to Douglas, and they donated it to the monastery hundreds of years ago. So the school board is willing to give the Douglas family some convenience at some point, but that doesn't mean they can cover the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Douglas sighed softly. "How can I reward your father? Boa? If your final grade - as you said, his big donation to school is not to see other children succeed. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give me some time." Boa insisted: "I can win."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bitter whip made of calfskin, hung in a dark corner with a few sharp corners hanging from the tip of the whip Small iron sheet, used to increase the suffering of self-criticians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hand pulled the light line and closed the only small light in the room. Now only the small window hanging high on the wall is available. It’s better than nothing. The hand is shrunk back, and the twin brothers with his twin brothers have untied their master’s clothes. There’s not much, only a brown-brown long-haired shirt with a small iron thorn so that it’s worn. The day and night are tumbling - the back of the skull is exposed, the buttocks are dry, and a belt ties the cross with the black pattern on the outside of the thigh with almost no muscles. Its tip often scratches the touched skin, where The wounds are always good and bad, bad, and nothing stops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went to the corner, picked up the whip, and returned to the front of the small altar with the cross, kneeling, giving respectfully under the watchful eyes of the Lord and the saints His own back - the whip is slammed on it, the sound is crisp and loud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After playing a hundred times, it’s less than Jesus’s outside the walls of Jerusalem—he doesn’t think he has this honor and the sacred The same bitterness, he sang the scriptures when he whipped himself, low but clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two black monks at the door waited anxiously, waiting for the people who had suffered the whip to come out, they were prepared to go forward and wait for the doctor outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you panic?" the deep voice said: "My physical and mental filth has been washed away, I have redeemed my Sin, I have never been so clean and happy, and my spirit is paralyzed." He swayed his arm slightly, pushed the support of the monk, took a few steps forward, and pushed the door to the outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun was projected, and Stefan looked up, and the tears of real tears flowed into the blue-gray eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
