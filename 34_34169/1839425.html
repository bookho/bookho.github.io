"They have a helicopter business."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red brushed white striped helicopter The low roar rose rapidly, and in a few minutes it hovered over a mountain that had taken off the snow coat. Two men in dark green ski jumped down and the man on the helicopter passed the next one. Folding the wheelchair, then a man with a windshield, a scarf, a black coat and a hat glove, in the process of putting him in a wheelchair, the scarf fell off, revealing a half of a meat mass similar to melting. The black hole in the meatballs sprayed a white mist, and the strange sights of the mercenaries who had experienced various horror scenes could not help but pause for a second, or two seconds. Their customers didn’t seem to notice or noticed, he didn’t care, he was in a wheelchair, after The person pushing the wheelchair turn directions, a military telescope will be placed in front of his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you see? Mr. Wharton."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Clearly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin jumped from the cable car and smashed the ski poles and skis. He heard Jesse calling him and he did not respond. He had hesitated whether he would bring Jessie together. After all, today will be an important big day, but a single man can be less common in the ski resort. He can certainly find one, but he never trusts those biaozi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He brought Jessie, dressed very normal, no sloppy words or patterns on his tops and trousers, wearing a black helmet, duty It’s like an old fool who has been studying boarding school for 20 years. Catherine didn't recognize him, she didn't have any little hybrids - he was proud of his little tricks, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took off the gray mirrored red windshield. The helmet, when a staff member tried to stop him from entering the cable car room, flew him directly. After a few seconds, his colleague also fell to the same situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin found the cable that would keep the cable car's traction device running. The amount of current emanating from him instantly burned the box that protected it. Its ferocious fellows immediately flowed from the broken cable to his body. How much electricity would the big guys who could drive 40 cable cars with a weight limit of 500 kilograms? Martin's math is not very good, but he never thinks too much. He walked out of the machine room and placed his hand on a rickety cable car in Jessie's horrified gaze. Countless screaming snakes climbed the cable car and surrounded it. Then, on the steel cable that is pulling it, it gathers again into a big dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A flash of blue and white light, the squeaky whip come. The entire cable car seat was drawn into the high air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas clearly heard Catherine’s screaming screams, and initially he was so relieved that he found himself in midair, he was from a height of thirty feet. Go down. The cable car filled with electric light is close behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was hit, the current slammed into the body, biting every skin it could find. Every bone, every muscle. Each viscera, every nerve, every cell, flows through each blood vessel, and then slips away from the toes—his body is completely uncontrolled, he can't see, he can't hear, and his brain is blank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He fell in the snow, his legs folded, and he had to live for a while before he knew he was still alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Lor is thrown out of the seat by Besib. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current wrapped in Besib, he was deformed, it became extraordinarily huge, even overflowing the seat, the current burned his skin and muscles, and squirted Stinking, they flow on him, passing through the cable car, trying to find the next target. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besib is behind Sasha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He yells in the pain, the elongated arm is wrapped around the steel cable, the current follows the shape, the arm is tightened to the cable, the current is burning, and the cable is not For humans, all the cable cars are shaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The uncaptured killer is steep forward, only a few feet away from its most important target. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cable is broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cable car jumped up, the cable whistled in the air, and the remaining current hit Sasha and Brian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cable car was planted in the snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martinie snorted with dissatisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His body is also in pain, wondering if it is often allowed to pass high-voltage current through his body, his body becomes more and more fragile, the last action After he found dendritic electric shock spots on his thighs and chest, it took a few months to disappear. This is not unusual for the abilities, and it is not a good sign, and his ability seems to be weakening. He can no longer send a spherical lightning that can move freely. No matter how much current is stored before, he can only light a 65-watt light bulb in a few days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had accumulated a little money before, after he knew Jesse, but the money was too little, not enough for him, Jesse and their children were comfortable. After serving the land for a lifetime, he is ready to take another vote and hide himself and his family in a warm and peaceful town. Maybe his ability will be restored in a while, when Jesse takes the child at home. He went out to work to earn money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went out and hesitated while passing the snowboard. It was too time consuming. He didn't want his enemy to recover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jessie followed him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Killing." Martin said he almost laughed Come out, these are the people he most wants to kill, except for Anthony Hopkins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He first found Catherine, who was crushed under the cable car, was embarrassed, seemed to be in a coma, or died. Her little lover was next to her, still alive, and one leg was unnaturally bent. Martin remembers that Catherine's little lover is a versatile person who can control plants. Unfortunately, the cable car's path is treated too cleanly. The pine forest is two miles away, and the snow under their feet is about a dozen feet. Under the snow is a hard rock formation. He wisely kept a distance from them, looked around and there was nothing around him that could induce current. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he still has a gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the gun was pointed at Catherine, Martin grinned. "We have to make a quick decision, brother," he said to the air: "There are too many movies because The villain who issued the victory declaration and was attacked by the protagonist's Jedi counterattack."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jessie is still yelling, Martin does not care. He pressed the trigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bullet penetrated Catherine’s arm and the pain caused her to wake up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin snorted, but it doesn't matter, he has bullets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin collects a ring, a silver ring, worthless, And very small. Not like the size of Martin. Inscribed with the name, "Dolores Kent." Jesse initially thought that this was a former lover to Martin, she also secretly smashed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One day she went to the police's intranet. Unexpectedly saw the name of Dolores, she is still a little girl, the report said that she was killed by lightning, and someone had sexual relations with her after the death. She told herself that this would not be done by Martin. He is just a bit bad, a bit sloppy. She checked Dolores' death date, and she comforted herself that Martin might have changed a bit, but at least he didn't kill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop, Martin. Otherwise I will shoot."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin turned back in surprise, he saw Jesse, and Jesse’s voice was shaking. The hand holding the mini gun was steady, and her nails were embedded in the trigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please, Martin." Jesse said, she felt the throat filled with snow: "I stopped immediately, Martin, otherwise I really want to shoot." - You know that this gun is capable of killing people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," Martin said scornfully: "I still give it to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go your mother's egg." He said, turned and went. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jessie fired, the fire-fired 2.34 mm calibre bullet, three shots, shot into Martin's neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She groaned, her eyes stunned, she didn’t seem to know what she was doing, and she pointed at her mouth the next second. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining two bullets were given to herself by her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine gasped in pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was chilly, confused, fell from a height of thirty feet, was hit by a cable car, was shot through the arm - but also concentrated, using Ability - a grassy hair with only the thickness of the hair, white and almost transparent, was pulled back in the snow, and it was quietly placed in the ear of Martin's girlfriend a few minutes ago as a medium - - Catherine received Jessie's emotions, and unexpectedly and fortunately found that the girl was still a good one. Great, Catherine fed back her emotions and enhanced her aversion and rejection of Martin. She fired and killed. Martin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go... look," she said to her people with difficulty: "Look, Sasha."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people around me didn’t say anything, just when Catherine was anxious to give him a risk of aggravating the injury, her lips were gently touched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hopkins is fine," Boa. Douglas said softly: "There is something for you, Catherine."<br /><br />&nbsp The fragile grass roots plunged into Catherine's nose, itchy, and then it penetrated the diaphragm and got into Catherine's brain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A group of idiots." Mr. Wharton said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took the remote from the mercenary and pressed the red button. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cockroach that was hidden under the snow exploded, the crack appeared on the snow surface, and the snow that broke into pieces began to slide down, more and more, the more The faster they come, the more they roll down when they are tumbling, it’s unstoppable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
