			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine stood up from the bathtub and wiped the foam on her body - she looked through her suitcase and found that the box was all Anthony Hopkin The clothes that Sis bought for the purchase, not silk, satin, no pants, the only one that allowed her to slightly resist the cold wind at the end of October, only a smocked jacket with a thin and thin skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two pairs of shoes, one pair is satin, the other pair, thank God, is a hollow lambskin shoe, and the heel is only two inches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She hurriedly stepped on the pair of lambskin shoes, put on the longest skirt, put on a blouse, put on a diamond bracelet, grabbed and threw it on the bed. The little bag ran out of the room, squatting down the stairs, and the waiter curiously looked up to see who made the noise of a furious adult rhinoceros in this quiet little hotel: "Ms. Stalin," he asked restrained: "What happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine couldn’t wait to say that she took the money out of her purse - Hopkins had about a thousand dollars in it. The new banknote, the one that has not been used, can make a loud noise in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please help me keep things in the room," Catherine said. "The extra is a tip for you."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she finished, she rushed out of the door, as if the devil was chasing behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hans touched the banknotes, the wonderful touch, the room rate and the custard add up to less than one hundred dollars, Ms. Catherine left two hundred dollar bills: I wish you all the best," Hans murmured. "No matter what you are going to do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he went to appease those sudden noises The guests are gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agency’s car was waiting outside Catherine outside the hotel, and Abel opened the door to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you also here?" Catherine asked, and then she knew she was stupid, and Abel was the person who followed and monitored her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The car is hot, the ceiling light is on, the orange-yellow light is surrounded by the smell of the leather and the rose deodorant in the car, she spits With a sigh of relief, I took off my suede jacket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young male sitting in the co-pilot immediately whistled, and Catherine found herself picking the wrong dress. This skirt is indeed the longest, but its material is also the most transparent, of course, the important part is covered with fine gold glitter. She did not notice at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abel pressed the window, the cool breeze passed through the car, and Catherine put on her blouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The passenger of the first officer gave a vague voice, but he did not dare to be too much. Abel and Catherine were the old people of the organization. In addition, their abilities were also It is daunting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What else can you see?" Catherine asked as she wiped the insecticide ointment. "I remember there was only a basement left. "It's still burning and exploding." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They hope we can have new discoveries," Abel said. After Katherine wiped all the skin that he could touch, he picked up his partner and wiped the place she couldn't touch. "We can have new discoveries, right? Catherine?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine didn't speak. She was a bit slack in her last assignment, and she was more fascinated by the scouts of Sasha Hopkins than the researchers who studied the bugs. The agency took a glance at this because the job was originally forced to be dispatched, and there was no real benefit. They couldn’t stay in the name, they couldn’t save the files, and those people used them as police dogs and tools. Even the experiments in the Tower of Babel wanted some locusts, after they discovered that the Institute of Biology was related to “Samuel”. Only got a small box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, it is because there is only a small box, and the locusts that have spread out have not caused too bad consequences. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is anyone dead?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not available yet," Abel said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine breathed a sigh of relief. She likes her colleagues, except for a few of them, such as Martin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You will be out soon." Martin said: "But To be on the safe side, you'd better not go home, and don't contact your former colleagues and friends. But I can help you give your old aunt some money."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesse looked at him suspiciously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, baby," Martin shouted. "You are really hurting my heart. What are you thinking? Don't tell me that you are Do you suspect that I sold you or irresponsibly thrown you out?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Or both." Jessie said with a smile: "I know that you are a new and boring bastard. Maybe you think this room should be a dull person. A younger and pretty bunny?" She stood up and walked to Martin, using a sharp nail file and screwing his neck. Pale loose skin. "Where are you going to fool around? I smell the disgusting smell of the child. Look at the mirror. Isn't it a satisfying thing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;;; Martin turned his head, he really looked at the mirror, "Well," after making sure that he did not leave any obvious traces, he put on an innocent look: "I just went to work." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Also go to play with women." Jesse said wickedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Also go to play with women." Martin admitted shamelessly: "It's just a little pastime - are you really not going out?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The way you transfer topics is really bad, Martin," Jesse said, and she picked up her arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But it works." Martin said, "Okay, let me tell you the truth. If you follow my plan, you probably have to stay here for the year." But suddenly, before jumping out of a big man, he is willing to provide protection for Avery Famo and his parents - you are by the way, but very lucky. But really, I think you better still can dive Deeper, I can get you the whole set of documents. Do you like the beach, the forest or the farm? I have real estate in those places."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Real?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s true." Martin said: "You are the only woman I want to marry you, you will be the mother of my child."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jessie has a few seconds of urge to snarl at him - since he wants to marry himself, why can't he tighten his zipper? ! But she knew it didn't help, she had tried it too many times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
