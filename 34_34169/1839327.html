			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black smoke and odor followed them out of the hole, and the escape is the exit or entrance to hell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishb helps Charlie get his dad out, he is still alive, breathing, very weak, Sasha must suspect that this man is also an ability However, he is still just an ordinary person after all, and his chances of survival are like dust in the sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They moved the head from the baptismal hall, although only one-fifth of the baptismal hall was left, and the remaining broken wall still exceeded the height of the general room. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corpse of the leader had only a few pieces of falling rocks. They also saw the two soldiers, one trap that died of the enemy, one murder that died from the companion, one The boy's hand is exposed from the pile of gravel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There should be one or four in the martyrdom. Besib remembers that the leader brought a total of seven people, so there are still four people. One of them should be the one who sent Boa. Douglas back to the barn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They didn’t hear it, and they didn’t see anyone here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can there be any way to get outside?" Besib asked, his pronunciation was a bit strange, he pressed his mouth and some teeth changed position. He tried to change them back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They didn’t think of going to the Dean’s room to take the phone, the leader was more than a word, but he would not forget to isolate the communication with the outside world. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is also a launcher for emergency contact in my room." Lila woke up, no, it should be "Billy", he talks I always loved the corner of my mouth - it was a chain with a photo box. Lila took it off when she was looking for a locust. When the soldier suddenly broke into her room, she could not find it. The opportunity to get it back - it can't be used for dialogue, but just open the photo box and press the button, Dr. Hopkins will get the news, he will come over immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I still can't move," "Billy" said: "I will go back soon. Marianne is also very tired, Lila is also, so only It’s a bit timid to let Lulu go. But when it comes to enduring pain and manipulating power, it’s okay.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There may be soldiers in the monastery." Sasha said: "Be careful. Do you still hurt?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lulu" is ashamed, small Shaking his head, I don’t know if it hurts or hurts, but her face is really pale. When she barely supports her body and penetrates the wall, she arches her back, puts her shoulders away, and shrinks herself very much. small. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib and Sasha took Charlie and his father to a niche standing in the Brazilian sage, a flower in front of the niche for the worship of flowers And the stone table of the scriptures. The sculpted snake and lizard-shaped dripper climbed up along the four feet of the stone table, and the tails intertwined with each other covered the lower part of the stone table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie leaned on the saint’s robes and let his father sleep in his arms. He rubbed the leader’s arm and chest in vain and whispered in a low voice. With. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is almost as good as his father. Only the brown eyes were lit with light, and when his eyes fell on Sasha, Bessie gently licked his tongue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prayers in those eyes are about to condense into substance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know what will happen," Sasha said. "I'm not sure..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Help me." Charlie pleaded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lulu" went in and replaced it in the corridor Pull, after all, only she knows the exact location of the room and the pendant. She successfully found the launcher in her room, opened the photo box, pressed the small portrait inside, and the pain during the burst did not make her coma again. "Billy" has always encouraged She took over the body immediately after she completed her task. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked through the wall from the other side of the room. A few minutes later he found Besib. One of Sasha's hands held the head's arm, floating, and the faint light and heat surrounding the man's body. "Billy" leaned back uncontrollably. It’s like a cold and hungry traveler who saw a pile of burning bonfires in the wilderness of the winter, and a large pot of broth on the campfire – no thoughts, no reason, pure instinct Dominate the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib pushed his face away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Billy" was a little more awake: "I saw a soldier," he said. "It is already dead."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The fifth one." Besib said: "There are three more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope that the two are not obedient Baby." Sasha said that their leader is an unquestionable change. Even if he said it was very pleasant, the thing he did was simply a slap in the face. Sasha did not doubt that he would give him soldiers before he arrived. Released orders to kill everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You mean," Besib said: "Will they escape if the mission is unsuccessful and the leader is dead?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is the best situation," Sasha said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you think anything is swaying?" "Billy" said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The ground?" Besib said: "I feel that I am already familiar with it, and I am almost ready to get engaged." He satirically Said, and in the next second, his face suddenly became bad: "I was thinking about one thing, Sasha." He said: "You said that the monastery was built on a 'tongue'?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes," Sasha said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They are being hollowed out by them, are they?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes Said Sasha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of this sentence, Sasha also understood the meaning of Besib, he put his hand on the ground, the vibration is getting stronger and stronger, the stone is laid. The ground cracked and the crack spread quickly to the sides and exploded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hate the monastery." Besib said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are also locusts." Sasha added that he reached out to "Billy", "Billy" was a boy, and Lila’s body was still Girl, and she is still sick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
