			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The child responsible for reporting to adults quickly climbed the slope of the stone, which formed a white base on his hair, arms and back. The constant sweat smeared his chin, and he panted, and it was difficult to speak consistently within a few minutes after being blocked by Don's "lady" - fortunately, what he needed to express was not that complicated: " 'Nail'... something went wrong!" he muttered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's the matter?" It was a young and cautious young man who reached out and touched the boy's face, which was as hot as a pancake on the stove. Burning people, "Speak clearly, what happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He was smashed by the jellyfish, and he screamed." The boy licked his lips: My mother has already rushed with baking soda and vinegar.” The black eye turned and he was a little nervous: “I went to the 'nail' home but didn’t find his mother – so I thought maybe I could find his father. - He may be here... is 'nail'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man nodded, "Okay," he said to the boy: "You Wait, I will help you to see if he is really here." He thought about it and added: "If there is nothing important, he will come out soon."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He handed the boy to a companion, who was alone in the rugged small stone road into the alley, the door of the alley Open it up, and he went inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tang’s courtyard is as cool and noisy as ever, trusted people scattered in the hyssops and olive groves, they are like a planet around the sun Galle. Some people have the privilege or privilege of being able to approach him casually and talk to him - his nephew, heir Mei Yalei, his beloved beater Toto (the father of "nails"), priest Anji, old Andri Yana, recently added - Dr. Hopkins, a strange inlander, is hard to say that it is because of certain needs or preferences. Most of the time, he is standing behind Tang, and his elongated limbs are almost completely The shadow cast by the huge body of the leader is annihilated. Occasionally, people will see the gray-blue eyes in the gaps left by the tangled gray hair of the Tang Dynasty. No one likes these eyes - they will make Reminiscent of the sky before the hurricane or the undercurrent of the seabed, the same soft, clean, and unpredictable, but there are hidden traps and threats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the eyes look over, they will prematurely divert their attention or walk away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They don't like me," said Anthony Hopkins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I remember you said to me," Chegarer sniffed his nose: "Only gold will be liked everyone." He slid his eye and glanced at it. The man around you, "And you really don't like it, you have to admit that you have at least not been cute." He paused and said impartially: "Many people are not as cute as him."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, he can be said to be horrified to find that Hopkins rolled up his lips: "I can't deny this." The child's father proudly confirmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changaler twisted his face and made an unbearable expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have to make a statement first," he said softly to himself. "I am definitely not because of what... of course, children...if I If there is a child... my performance will not be so stupid, I swear." As if to escape from this naive situation, Chegal suddenly stood up and walked towards the center of the courtyard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This morning, Tang decided to move the marble table from the center of the courtyard to the left side, so much to get a little shade of the olive grove, so people acted - they Remove the gorse and rose that occupy the new position of the table, sprinkle with grass seeds, smash the ground... All goes well, but it is stuck in the tons of marble table - they sent six young men, Pushing and dragging, moving only three feet in less than two hours, some people suggested to get a small crane, but how to put the crane connected to the heavy truck on a steep slope and squeeze into the narrow alley In the end, it is an unsolvable problem to finally push the door for the two people to walk in and out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A group of sighing idiots!" Chegaler complained loudly: "No one thought about how it was placed here?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He strode to the crowd while taking off his shoes, shirts and hats, revealing the fat and moist pale flesh, and people let them go in awe. Watching him walk to the front of the table, bent down and drilled in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chugaler’s feet were tightly stepping on the grass that had just been trimmed, and the broken grass stem stabbed his sole. He made several deep breaths. Having his head, neck, shoulders and waist under the table - he lowered his head slightly, his back arched, his two thick arms sticking out, his fingers clutching the edge of the table, and the warm skin clinging to the rough bottom of the marble table, he The knees are bent, the trouser legs are rolled up, and the calf is like a huge stump of two flesh-colored... "Hey! Hey! Hey!" He loudly reminded the young people standing next to the table: "Attention... Ok! Let We get up...start...come!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins is obsessively observing, this is a very rare phenomenon, not all people's fat can become muscle in just a few seconds - muscles swell and roll up, and soften in a blink of an eye The fat, the skin becomes tight, thin and smooth with their help, and the large and small blood vessels are clearly visible, especially on the neck and limbs - the old Samson (the powerful warrior in the Bible) straightens out slightly Legs, the four tables of the marble table carved into shells left the ground with dirt, "now...in." Tang gave instructions under the table, his voice screaming like a lion roaring in a deep cave: "Now ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray-white stone table is like a living, deformed giant sea turtle, rising again in the eyes of people who are surprised and admired, and then extremely slow but Steady moving toward the left front - the young assistants who are responsible for guiding and assisting are a little busy, but fortunately they don't make the wrong direction or stupidly put their toes under the table when they land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Celegal got out from under the table, his hair was dripping, his face was as red as a burning lobster, he didn’t sit down or stand up immediately Moving, but slowly swaying in the courtyard, slowing down breathing, moving hands and feet and body, quickly, the muscles disappeared, the skin relaxed again, and he changed back to a soft old look - except for the cheeks Hot flashes, a little bit of temper, he gave him a big glass with iced wine, he drank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Today's dinner is ahead of schedule," Chegal said with satisfaction: "Add some roast chicken and tender beef."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am afraid I can't participate." Toto said: "My son was smashed by the jellyfish."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Celegal I cast a surprised and concerned look: "It's too bad," he said. "How is the situation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It shouldn't be too bad," May Yalei interjected: "I heard that they have already wiped him vinegar and soda."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For safety reasons, let the hospital observe it," Chegal Made a gesture: "In addition, Anthony, you go with them - if I am not mistaken, you have research... those things?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp In fact, about 50% of the world's poisonous plants and creatures have been very familiar and familiar with Hopkins, and there is no shortage of dangers in the moment. - Since the boy did not die immediately, indicating that the little thing is not mild or insufficient, it is likely to be the latter, because children living on the beach should have been accustomed to slight stings and bites, which can make them panic. There are too few things that yell and scream but are not fatal. Less Hopkins can almost immediately list a simple and clear form and indicate the solution later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But obviously, some people are not willing to accept this situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't think it's necessary." Toto said that he and his son are not very similar - not so much that he is a big nail or a screw, not as good as Said to be a hammer, short and strong, dark skin, Hopkins found that he clenched his fist when he spoke, his heart fell slightly, as if he had to be with someone at any time, but his eyes were hanging down, he I dare not look directly at Tang, because for whatever reason, he has violated Tang’s will to some extent: “A little trouble...he is your friend.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Celegal looked at him with a gentle expression. "No," he said. "My dear Toto, no, you are wrong. He is not my friend. He is our friend." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have to remember this." Tang looked around and stressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The father of "nail" is not wrong, just a little trouble, Huo Pukins inspected the little boy who was extremely imaginary. It was basically confirmed that it was a cyanide jellyfish, that is, the tentacles could reach 60 feet in length, commonly known as the lion's mane. Its toxins were very strong, if it was It has been “snapped” directly, even a strong and powerful adult can not help but die, but fortunately, the small “nail” is only swept by the edge of its tentacles, so it is not hurt too much, of course, stay The observation of the hospital is a must. The viciousness of the cyanide jellyfish is that the pain and injury it brings will be strong for a while,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;after listening to Hopkins The report, Chegarha pondered for a while: "Let the boys do activities... a group of two, driving a boat to the surface of the sea, 50 yuan per person per day, find cyanine jellyfish or other dangerous things. Children counted by pounds, one hundred yuan per pound, from me - just like this, otherwise children We can't help playing in peace - I think you have warned everyone on the island to let them know that it is not allowed to go into the water before it is thoroughly cleaned and cleaned?" He asked this In the words, the line of sight turned to his nephew. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, Don." Respectfully said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Excellent." Chegara snorted with satisfaction: "I hope they can do this quickly, but accurately."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
