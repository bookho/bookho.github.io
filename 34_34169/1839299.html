The red-haired young man said that his little finger on the steering wheel carries a mosaic The ring of blue-green tourmaline, the ring is very large, almost covering the entire second joint, bright in the morning sun is like a water taken from the deepest part of the ocean. "More than a hundred years ago, it didn't even have a name. No one thought of coming here, it's only a little better than hell. The yellow sand everywhere, the land is barren, the clean water can only be found from the animals and their own bladder and blood vessels. .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until someone found gold here.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold quickly digging out, some people Going, more people stayed, they continue to dig copper and sulphur here - oh, mining is never a good job, hard, boring, monotonous, dangerous, and the mines and stones except the black holes are A man who is as hard as himself, rude, dirty, illiterate, never going to church, no parents, no children, no place to live, only the devil knows that they are coming out from there - except the criminals A group of wild dogs who will become criminals; wages are meager until you want to eat, don’t think about women, of course, there are very few women coming here - it’s too dangerous, everywhere is strong but forced to at least a man who has been abstinent for a few years And the eyes and fingers of the law and morality have not yet fallen here - even the oldest, ugliest and most loved money 女* women don’t dare to try to see if they can leave with a lot of money or after a few days. The bare land is thrown directly into an abandoned mine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No one knows when and where the first gambling took place," Judah, heaven The new owner of the palace continued: "In short, there is a smart person who feels that it is too wasteful to let those strengths and flesh and blood be wasted on the yellow sand outside the bar. At the beginning, everything was very simple, two bastards playing Together, when you hit another one, you can't move or die, even if you win, the banker who plays the gambling game taps. The winner gets money from the dealer... Hey, maybe not money, anything can be used. Mortgage, wine, meat, bread, pants, shirts, ores, even buttons, dentures. As long as you want to get it, you will be put on the table. As long as the dealer and the gambler recognize it - someone who has pushed him from the outside Got to the table."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;& Nbsp;&nbsp;He slightly adjusted the rearview mirror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He won, but it’s a pity that the person who won won always wants to win again, the second time he loses, even the previous win Something and his younger son." Judah smiled slightly, revealing the white canine teeth: "The dealer at the scene was very generous. After the gambling game, all the gamblers who got the gambling were given a cheap opportunity to approximate the white delivery. , including his father. It is said that the child screamed all night without interruption, which is really rare, to know. If the record is not wrong, he is only eight years old, and is seriously malnourished - record this matter It’s a priest who wants to save the lost lamb. When he first arrived, he was run away by the really hellish hell. Since then, his toes have not been touched by a little. Special dust, he died 50 years later, his diary was swayed many times, and later was given to Lafayette, I saw this record in the mining museum... Aha!" The steering wheel was violent Turning, turning from a wide driveway into a narrow pony "Look. This is really a bad thing," he said to himself. "Well, let's get back to the topic, my dear friends - I just want to tell you, I am going to bring you What we are looking at is the legal boxing gambling that is officially licensed and supervised (he is legally accented). Organized books have been recorded for more than 150 years, and have a longer history than Lafayette. ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Note: Lafayette is made by the town of the town)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the second day of Christmas, they pass through a community, snowy, central and residential The road has been cleaned. The grayish black cement is exposed, and the snow on both sides is piled up very high. In front of each house and in the hallway, the colorful Christmas decorations in the courtyard are also shining, and the sharp eyes of the sand are captured. A snowdrift on the head of Santa Claus is sitting on a fat squirrel, the purpose of which is the pair of scorpions that are filled with Santa's eyes. The vigilant little animals move fast, and in a few seconds, the sacs on both sides become bulging. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it’s a legitimate boxing match, everything is of course bright, and Kleks of Judah is parked in front of a building that looks like a lively little theater. There is nothing to be surprised about. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole building is old, and the electronic display screen placed on the right side of the door is quite advanced. You can see the game arrangement for nearly a week. The winners of each boxing competition last week, as well as the brief information of the champions of the quarterly and annual competitions, and then the details of the players who are about to start today, with photos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the top of the screen is the "Yvli Gymnasium". Yvli is a local word, meaning the place where the wild boar fights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who greet them have the pale yellow ochre hair and brown eyes of most Western men. He is a man about 50 years old, but There is a female name, Abby, who is unusually small and thin, almost two-thirds of Judas. When he walks in the hallway and is surrounded by a deliberately enlarged photo of a boxer, it is like being surrounded by giant guards. The gnome king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He spoke in a whisper, walked a little bit and jumped a bit, his eyes were innocent and like a child, it’s hard to imagine him. It is the big boss in Lafayette who has the most boxing gambling games and controls the most boxers. "God," Abby said sweetly. "In Lafayette, boxing is legal, open, clear, and me. I admit that I have a gym that can legally open a boxing gambling game, but I have never controlled any boxers. I don’t have any boxers in my game. No, no one. Every boxer who is willing to go to the stage is Free and voluntary, they are good citizens who are law-abiding, have a healthy marriage and family, do not take drugs, are not jealous, rarely drink alcohol and smoke. This is a healthy event, the upward event is full of wisdom, The game of strength and humanity is better than basketball, better than football, better than baseball. I have never seen a game that is more touching and tearful than boxing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He did not say anything wrong. The boxers are indeed not allowed to take drugs and shackles. The wine and the smoke will also be restricted, because all of these will affect their performance," Judah said softly. "But this is only part of it. In other parts, the unregistered 'blacks' are not someone who care too much about these issues."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is no way Things, gentlemen." Abby made a helpless gesture: "I said, this is a good sport, everyone loves, when those young people come here, ask to participate in the game, God, look at their Eyes, full of courage and longing eyes, how can I refuse them? I am not the kind of heart-shaped person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You certainly won't Refused them," said Red Hair Judah, "How can a gambling game without death come worth every fifty yuan?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Every boxer." The gnome king said coldly, "Whoever is going to fight in Abby's arena, you have to sign an agreement. I admit that there are some young people who are not very good, but since they If you want to stop them, who can stop them? Some of them Xu is eager for such an ending, a brilliant, vigorous, and dying in the praise and admiration of all. Like a real man, the death is no more than a lonely, full of pipes, and dying in the hospital Is the bed better?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a subtle smile on his face: "They like this, I know." He whispered like this. After one sentence, I hurriedly said something again: "But." He stressed seriously: "I must say that some people in the outside world always misunderstand the boxing match, and no, no, the death rate of the boxing match. Not as high as they think, there are experienced emergency doctors on the scene. The well-equipped medical ambulance is always parked at the door. As soon as the slamming sounds, the referee raises the winner's hand and the injured children immediately Can you get the most timely treatment... What? I can only say that some children are just too unlucky, but can you tell me what sports can guarantee no disability and death? No, no, even Playing cards Chess can't be waived, so why don't they apply for exempting poker and chess games? This is totally a form of discrimination."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abby Deep I sighed: "Please forgive me. As long as I talk about this, I am always a little uncontrollable. I have to know that I love the sport so much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did say too much, during this time, they have walked through a long corridor and went up two flights of stairs to the arena. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since it is a legally open and innocent gambling game, the venue will naturally not be set in a gloomy basement. The building has a high floor height and a large glass window in the south. In addition to the bright natural light, there is also an artificial light source. In addition, every corner is clean and clearly identifiable. The center of the rectangular field is a regular boxing ring, a silver-wrapped guardrail, a gray ground, and a pair of logos with a twisted human shape in the center, which is orange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you see what it is?" Abby asked happily: "Remind, it's about what we're going to see."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Theusian boxing," Sasha said. "Two people sit face to face and box each other until one dies."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abby’s eyes widened, “Amazing knowledge!” The little hands slaped in surprise: “I like you,” he said earnestly: “Really, You must be a child who loves boxing, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha did not respond, just as the first impression of the building’s appearance, here It is indeed a theater. The stage has been dismantled and the stepped seat has been changed to surround the boxing ring for a week. However, the box hanging on the three walls was retained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The audience are taking a seat, and Sasha slightly estimated that there are about 500 to 600 people. The previous Judah has already mentioned that the ticket price is about fifty. Yuan, then this event can at least income from 25,000 yuan to 30,000 yuan, but since it is a gambling game... Abby's real profit is still behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone will bet." Abby said: "One hundred, up to one thousand," his cheek muscles twitched a bit: "This It is legally prescribed, but we are trying to raise the ceiling. This is a good sport... Oh, please go here, the above view will be better."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;He took Judah, Sasha, and Besib to the front of a small box, and then proudly and respectfully picked up the velvet curtain: "Please come in, my guests, please come in."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somewhat unexpectedly, there is already another person in the box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God," Abby screamed in a pretentious manner: "Look at my memory, I am sorry, I forgot to tell you, one The guest is earlier than you arrived - please let me know, this is Konstantin. Crovin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
