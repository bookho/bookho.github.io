			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha and Besib returned to the room, they were very tired, but fortunately the bathroom in the villa did not allow them to use a shower mixer at the same time or Bathtub, but they still choose to sleep on a bed, this is not for Besib, but for the sand, the air in Las Vegas is still in danger and uneasiness, no one can expect the next moment will happen What are you doing? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little Hopkins is able to deal with most adults, even some abilities, when he is awake, but he has to rely on instinct when he is asleep, but he It was impossible to open a barrier between the fingers like Besib that was strong enough to resist the close-up shot of machine gun bullets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The children slept very hard, and Shasha couldn’t remember when he fell asleep, just as he didn’t know how he woke up, he opened his eyes. Adjust your breathing and wait for the brain and body to be fully awake. They didn't put down the light brown gauze at the bedside before going to sleep. Its hanging posture on the pole made Little Hopkins think of the vines wrapped around the tropical trees without any reason. He had hundreds of times. That's how they watched them wake up - only that he always slept in his father's arms, otherwise the mother with a red beard would try to steal him - it succeeded. Sasha looked at the ceiling covered by the cloud-like tent and smiled softly. Besib was by his side. His body was always hot, and his body became colder than he grew older. Sasha is at least two to three degrees Fahrenheit. The heat is constantly transmitted from the boy's dark brown skin and the inside of the body. Even if you don't touch it, you can feel the strong and vigorous vitality. Sasha tentatively moved his finger and touched the skin of Besib - almost immediately, Besib's heartbeat changed. The thick black eyelashes flowed through the golden light very quickly, and Sasha touched it. Touch him. The touch was soothing, and the muscles of Besib relaxed. He bent his lips lazily, rolled over, and buried himself in a fluffy goose down pillow, expressed in a silent language. I still want to sleep for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha slammed into the bed, and given the extraordinary hearing of the abilities, he went downstairs and finished the washing in an empty room. He also found new socks in the closet of the room. Although it is worn by adult males, it is not a big one because of its excellent elasticity. Sasha sat on the clean and soft bed and dressed them - the floor of the villa, whether it is marble, floor or carpet, is equipped with a plumbing system, 365 days a year, twenty-four hours a day. Tons of hot water flow in pipes buried in concrete slabs, ensuring that the surface materials covering them are always maintained at a comfortable temperature - but Sasha likes to wear socks (except for Besib) Soaked in sea water or a bathtub, when sleeping on a bed), cotton or wool, elastic, the feeling of being gently grasped and squeezed allows him to calm down quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The small clock on the bedside table indicates that it is now around 4:30 in the morning. As Sasha walked through the living room, the sky outside was still dark, and the lights in the courtyard were extinguished by a large part. But there are still about half a dozen lights on, their light is mostly projected on the bushes and the water of the swimming pool, and will not affect the guests' sleep. The hidden better atomizing nozzles have started to work, at high pressure. The diameter of the water droplets ejected below is only ten micrometers. By the time the sun rises, the rapidly evaporating water droplets at a sharply elevated temperature can cause the surrounding environment to drop by about 3-7c in a matter of seconds. In addition, the dust and debris that permeates the forest will be caught by these small water droplets, forming a thick white mist - when the fog is dispersed, the surrounding air will become clean and moist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the daytime, the villa’s kitchen looks bright and spacious, and everything is in order. In the dark, it looks a bit sullen, cold and impersonal, mirror or The brushed stainless steel floor and the wall are spotless, there is no finger print on it, and the number and type are equally amazing. The knives and pots stand in their respective positions like strangers, and the reflection on them is like a blinking eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine sat by the window, there was a table for the final set on the table, with a bottle of wine close to the bottom, the bottle facing in, Sasha I can't tell if it's wine or whiskey - but he quickly realized that the bottle is square, and there are very few wine bottles in this shape, it should be a bottle of whiskey. There is no cup, next to the bottle is a bright white porcelain plate with a few bare olives and dark ash, rows of neat black cigarettes, and the kitchen is full of aromatherapy oil-like fragrance Smell, Sasha carefully sniffed, only a cigar named "Black Devil" from the southern archipelago of the western continent would have this smell. This cigar is not expensive, it seems that Catherine's recent economy The situation got a pretty good upgrade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Institutions" have always been generous and generous to people who are useful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine, who had been looking out the window, heard the voice and turned her head. When she found her identity, she could say that she would be reflectively placed on the index finger. Between the middle finger, about one-third of the cigars left in the porcelain plate, and then stared at Sasha for a while, suddenly remembered something, and hurriedly poured the last whiskey into the ash. The bottle was thrown under the soles of the feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bottle falls on the polished marble, and the sound of the collision is like a bell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine jumped up, knocked over the chair, and the chair fell to the ground, making a louder sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The well-dressed butler appeared in the kitchen door at the right time, and Shasha shook his head. He retired and closed the kitchen door with enthusiasm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Want to talk to me?" Sasha said: "Catherine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Catherine's reaction is not as fast as usual, maybe she doesn't want to talk to anyone at this time, but as Sasha thinks, she won't give up this opportunity - look, only the two of them, no Anthony Hopkins, There is no other sibb. than the mulberry land, there is nothing else in the mess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well... talk." Catherine said a little uneasily, she lifted the chair, picked up the hem of her pajamas, wiped the chair, and sprinkled Sha noticed that she was barefoot and her hair was a little damp. She probably just took a shower and went to drink and smoke. She didn't even have the thought of drying her hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Would you like something to drink?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be free - don't drink."< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha opens the door-to-door freezer, which is large enough to hold four Catherine or six Sashas, ​​and the drinks inside are dazzling: “mix juice concentrate How?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh...well," Catherine had never heard of this brand: "Thank you."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The drink from Sasha is very dark. Catherine took a bite and tasted it. It is black mulberry, sour and sweet, and full of flavor. Sasha used a chunky glass with a thick cup and a small piece of ice that was broken. Catherine turned the cup between her hands. She didn't know where to look for the topic. They had been separated for several years. I had a few meetings in the boarding school and concert a while ago. In two hours, she read the information provided by the "institution". Sasha grew up, is very healthy, is good at swimming, has excellent academic performance, and is very popular among the teachers. Unfortunately, there are very few friends and only one is less. Catherine will Blame on Anthony Hopkins and Besib. Bissance, completely forgetting that he and his sister, Catherine, are few friends who can be called close friends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his ability, the ability has not changed, but has increased, she has personally experienced it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha pulled the opposite chair and sat across from her, her knees touching her knees. He is already a big boy, his body is slender (this is like his father), and the voice at the beginning of the change period is a little weird. Fortunately, he didn’t scream like a duck like the boys in Catherine’s memory. The low hoarseness after a long cry, it is known that Sasha is a beautiful boy, and the combination of the two is very easy to make people who do not know the truth pity and cherish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one can imagine how terrible his ability is - his ability can't kill a person directly, even a small insect can't, but borrow With his help and urging, even Catherine, who was originally assisted and investigated, can kill people, quietly, without seeing a trace of blood, without any effort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not too happy, Catherine." Sasha said, with a lingering remnant, Catherine forced herself not to think of his father, "the corpse Ghost" Anthony Hopkins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing... I mean, I am used to it..." Catherine said, she drank a big drink, the result of a swallowing was a dark The liquid leaked out of her closed lips, and she coughed up and covered her face with her palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I thought you killed someone." Sasha said, he reached out and gently wiped Catherine's forehead with the back of his finger. The cold fingers made Catherine shudder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I am sorry..." Catherine’s voice sounded tired and powerless: "Sorry, it doesn't matter to you...just, there... There is..." She didn't notice - her ability was out of control at the end, and some of the "Tianqiu" gamblers died, or became vegetative, mostly elderly, and... children. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are about the same size as you." One boy, two girls. Their bodies are intact, with breathing, pulse, blood pressure, normal body temperature, and the brain has stopped working. The doctor said that they may wake up in the future, but Catherine knows no, they will never open their eyes, talk, and walk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But it is not innocent." Sasha grabbed Catherine's hair and let her look at herself. The boy's purple eyes were not black under the dim light. A little bit of impurities: "They looked at and looked at us as happy and happy, everyone made a bet, Catherine, no lamb, no lamb."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
