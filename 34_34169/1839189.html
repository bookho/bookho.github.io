			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter 109 Offences (2)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good people are cutler Oh, Hopkins knows that the name of "Father" is the same as that of the earliest martyr. They are called Stefan, and he can guess that it is, but she is really nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How are they willing to let the priests?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because the Vatican is awkward." Le said with no respect, all the people on Poseidon Island are devout Catholics, but the division of labor is different, the women are responsible for obedience, and the men get the right from them - Masoye has kidnapped several priests, the parish Even the cardinal, the abductees got better treatment than the average person, they paid the ransom in time, so they were almost completely released safely. The only unlucky one was only because they were allergic to fleas. The rash: "He is now a big baby, a living saint, a sacred flesh and blood, and an inexhaustible sacred scorpion. He raised his hand and said, 'Open it.' The dumb can speak. And say, 'Get up and walk,' the scorpion will be able to jump and jump again and say, 'See me,' the scorpion will be able to see the light again, saying, 'Healing it,' the leprosy patient becomes a cute little angel, ask me to say, Even Jesus may not be able to do more than him. "Chopard has added sourly: "The bishops simply put him on the head and sent it to the Vatican."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins light Lightly rubbed the inside of the index finger with his thumb. It seems that at that time, the power of Sasha also affected him. Stefan was not a slow idiot. Since Marena could manage to find him and Sasha, then Stefan also Yes, no one can be indifferent to such power... Chegal is also, but this clever old guy is more willing to maintain his ability in a stable state, he has a good control of his desires . What about Stefan? Why didn't he appear? Where have he been in these three years? Perhaps, at the beginning, he could not control his new ability. But obviously, now he can. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it’s only a long time for Chekal to leave the two little guys to leave here, the sea god island is small, and the western continent is much wider. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, I still have to stay here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Tell me, please tell me," Hopkins said, and he used you and Chegal to use exactly the same meaning: "Organization What you conveyed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chegal opened his mouth, "smart old bastard," he deliberately revealed a dissatisfied expression: "Yes, the agency found me, they are willing to take the lead."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins spread his palms around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cooperation, a short-term cooperation, dear," Chegal immediately replied: "They need us, the Madonna bless, they have met in these years." There was a lot of trouble." At the mouth of the speech, "Tang" has been closely watching Hopkins's reaction. Has he frowned, has not pouted, and has a small wrinkle on his forehead and corners of his eyes? He couldn't find anything, and Hopkins was calm and amiable, as if the things that Chegal had just mentioned had nothing to do with him. It’s clear that Chekal is not the same thing at all – this is why the agency has to deal with ghouls through him. As long as he knows a little about Hopkins, he knows how proud he is. The gang guy, in his eyes, most of the human beings are pigs, but some are of good quality and some of them are of inferior quality. The FBI and the low-energy children in the institutions naturally belong to the latter - some of them are Howling and squirting the way to enhance their sense of existence, in the end they always let them smash the buttocks and the squats of their heads, he scorned them, mocked them, and took them to make some vicious jokes - as long as the time permits, Ghouls will always prepare a way for them to die for people to talk about. A promising, young and strong FBI agent (he was Catherine's predecessor) and he had dealt with him. The last face was drawn by him like Picasso's oil painting; in the second jailbreak, some The unfortunate prison guard was made into a "blood eagle" (a medieval criminal law that pulled the lungs out of the spine on both sides of the spine); and that annoying, ** and imagination were too strong, The taste of Colendler, Catherine's former boss, he had the privilege of tasting his brain with Hopkins and Catherine; in a very chance, he found the ghoul and sold him to a private enemy. The fallen sergeant of the Florentine authorities was hung on the window of the Palace of Vecchio, like his ancestors, and his stomach swayed between his legs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trying to persuade such a person is quite dangerous and difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cigaler sighed and concentrated on a plate of garlic and cheese. "We are old," he said. "And the children are still like that." Young, we brought them to the world, not to make them uneasy day and night - you see, I am making efforts, not only Besib, but also Sasha, I am trying to open up a The descendants of the Poseidon Island people can safely take a new path of time - the time has passed since the bullets and the daggers have been spoken for a long time. Nowadays people need to be tolerant and understanding. We will follow the rules and obey the law... in the right place. It’s not a bad thing to give in. It’s fine if you can achieve your goals.” He sorrowfully ate the last piece of cheese, and Hopkins turned his gaze to the sea – from where they can see the lonely The "Christian frame" in the sea, three years ago, the scorpion and heir of the cutler, Meyare, died there, covered with dark purple strips of bruises and blisters on the skin, bleeding in the eyes. - This time it was the turn of Chegal to reveal an innocent look. "The most important thing," he picked up a brand new shell spoon and reached out to a pile of lobster seeds. "That's what we have to deal with." He meant Deeply pointed to the edge of the plate: "The guys are preparing for the tiger to eat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Those guys," Hopkins said, cocking his fingers and setting it up on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Those guys." Chegaler affirmed: "They are different from us, they have too little, they want too much, they want strength, but they I don't know how to use it reasonably, I don't have a head, I don't know how to stop it - they prefer to indulge their desires endlessly, they have provoked countless troubles, and thousands of people suffer, but only for a little Stinky fish - so the organization will be so urgent, these people are the key to the organization, some people are attacking the organization, and intend to swallow this fat little pork. This is really terrible, Hopkins If my message is not mistaken, it is the "gci" (communication headquarters) that stands behind the attackers, which is harder than the FBI."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins knows that "gci" is really annoying. The most secretive and important part of the national violent train, they want "institutions", which is normal, the crime rate of the abilities is near There has been a blowout in three years, and the country needs more Special staff to deal with these criminals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So what do they do after they have finished? Also erase my name? Just like you?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Celegal shakes his head: "Yes, they can erase your name, my dear friend, but they can't guarantee that you can get peace of mind - they made another Remuneration, I think you might be interested," Chegal said. "They will hand over all the information about the rewards that are relevant to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huo Pukins leaned back. For the former, he was not very interested. He was different from Chegal. He was too famous. The reward for the collectors alone was as high as several million yuan, but according to The law of most parts of the Western Continent, this reward is only valid when the reward is still alive, unless his descendants are willing to continue to offer. In addition, this can also be seen as an implicit promise and guarantee – although this guarantee may be lighter than a slice of sour cucumber at some point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We have our approach, right? My dear Hopkins." Chegaler said coldly: "They won't want to die." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they fell silent at the same time, because Old Andriana brought a golden roast goose. Hopkins began to think. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Jiao Anpu just said it,” said Old Andriana. “The children don’t come back for lunch. They found a lot of fat oysters today – enough for everyone to eat.”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, I didn't realize that it was almost noon," Chegaler rubbed his neck in surprise and raised one hand and rubbed his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because you are always eating the relationship, Chegal," Old Andriana said straight through: "At least in the middle of three meals, a little restraint Otherwise, one day you will not even be able to get up the stairs." She turned her eyes to Conpkins: "As a doctor, you should remind him of this."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Andriana is almost seventy years old. She grew up watching Chegal and has a special status, and some of her places reminded Hopkins. Sasha, and his own nanny. At the end of the war, she insisted on going back to her hometown to see how the children's home was. I didn't care why they only let her go. He worried about her for a while, until the shadow of horror and despair suddenly shrouded in the morning. He and his family - a boy, he never thought before, even the crimes that have never happened in the most insidious books and the most terrible nightmare will saw his life like a saw - that The little girl smiling in the tub in the sun died, her brother died, and the ghoul was born. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay," Hopkins replied in a serious manner: "I will remind him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Old Andriana sneered at the "Little Boys" trick, but she is not prepared to expose them at this time: "Little Boop also brought a message," she said: "They have a guest. , a girl, Chiz Carson."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha lifts up An open oyster, the body leans forward slightly, bringing the lips close to the inner layer of the shining shell - just like a wine, gently lifting your fingers and neck, with a slight sucking - a metal-like seawater and The smooth oyster meat fell into the mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(To be continued)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Some readers have suggested that it is a bit of a violation of Hopkins to do things for the organization - indeed, the ghoul is a dangerous person who is difficult to control and control, but be aware that he is not the kind of unreasonable, arrogant An idiot that is irrational and manipulated by emotions, whether it is killing or eating, he knows exactly what he is doing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because in the article, I can't make these two guys say something plain like a young man, so explain it here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why should the organization work with Ghoul and Chegal? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mentioned earlier that the organization is not without enemies. In particular, they really want to make this unintelligible at first, but now it seems to be very few The semi-official organization that divides power is completely official - because of Hopkins' relationship, they have lost a number of disturbing abilities in the Tower of Babel. In three years, they may have recovered a few But more have disappeared into the vast sea of ​​people, and they are still committing crimes. This big blow is caught by their enemies. They are accused and suspected of not being able to properly control those who are abilities. It may be taken over in full, so the head and brain above will be so impatient. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the possibility that they are still holding the idea of ​​driving the wolf, or catching the oriole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do you want to work with institutions? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to that list, he is still preparing to wash the entire Masoye. But it takes time. "gci" is more difficult and unfamiliar than the FBI. He doesn't want to face this huge monster with too much claws too early, and he won't add fuel to it - even put his handle Into the other party's hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why should ghouls work with institutions? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malena can find Sasha, others can, in fact, Chegal has mentioned this very vaguely, he can't wait for someone to come to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in his heart, Sasha is the reincarnation of his sister, he hopes that she (he) can be happy, and a happy life, at the very least Let's spend it in the hunt for people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins has gone through many places before he was arrested, and then he also has Catherine, a lover who can be the same as his soul, and Sand, his children and hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He certainly expects Sasha to get more, and he did it before. Otherwise, it is not impossible for him to carry Sasha in the Amazon for a lifetime - a reader adult described the previous experience as a dark version of Meng Musan, huh, huh, really not wrong, because Hopkins’s actions It is indeed for the sake of sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
