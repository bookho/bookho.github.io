			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John Carson is not so courageous, he dares to resist "Tang", but because he has not seen what is standing in front of him A huge monster. This is a common problem for inland people. They grow up in a peaceful and affluent environment. They have everything they need. The biggest worry may be just a pimple that grows on the tip of the nose. In adulthood, even if they are separated from the wings of their parents and family. Asylum, living like an "ordinary person", still survives under the protection of so-called common sense, law and morality. For them, crime is speeding, credit card debts and marijuana, and killing often happens only 20 yards away from them. It’s too far away, far away is like another planet. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changalle made him feel the fear, but he hadn’t reached the point where he was completely awake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is intentional. Sasha is not Anthony. He has received too little information. For the time being, he cannot calculate the plan of "Tang". He only Knowing that John Carson’s ending will not be very good – in the memory of the “Ghoul”, his father, Anthony Hopkins, there are not many such characters, they are not bad, and IQ is not low. The problem is that they are mostly naive and greedy, often knowing that they can't do it; they can see the danger, but they always confuse their lives and even the souls to things they can't grasp, just for a little bit of watching. Going to the glittering and worthless fancy gadgets - Catherine’s former boss was one, the one who wanted to sell the ghoul to his enemies, the little punk on the train, the priest in the town It is one, and John Carson is one of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The law of the world has its own gains, and the income must be lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The golden-red natural light that penetrates the small window is replaced by a soft artificial light source. The luminaire equipped with intelligent sensing function is like the moonlight instead of the daylight. In the baths of the hustle and bustle, the children's skin began to rise and crease. They climbed out of the bath, dried their bodies, and put on the clean clothes of the old Andriana resting on the wooden bench. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha bluntly rejected the invitation of Besib - he has already had enough of Besib's collection - even for Hopkins, they Some of them are too strange. For example, a dagger has a highly compressed air canister inside the handle, controlled by a button. After the knife has penetrated into the body of a human or animal, press it. Button, the ultra-high pressure air will spurt out along the small pipe in the blade... Then, with a bang, perhaps the wound that was not so important will be supported by the size of the basketball... The devil knows, Which boring guy will design this stupid and terrible thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Hopkins, Little Hopkins has some bad habits from the blood and surnames. They love traditional and ancient things. They don't like to change and make new attempts. Their eyes will be too singular, and they will be more slick, and they will become more critical. Until now, Anthony Hopkins still rarely used guns. He prefers knives and shorts, or bows. He also uses surgical instruments, such as small electric cranio saws and hollow bones, as the case requires. Drill, but that's it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boy is like a Pogne cat with a pale golden fur, silently licking his toes and slamming the stairs along the inside of the fortress. Guests, they are arranged on the upper floor, the room is wide and bright, and there is a platform. Outside the platform is a steep and narrow stone land bridge connecting the outside with a wide wall for two people. Five hundred years ago, the people in the fortress The hot oil and water were brought up from here and passed through the dangerous road to the soldiers who guarded the fortress. They dumped them and attacked the enemies around the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now they have lost their original role, because of the strong sunlight, the strong sea breeze and the salty wet water it is wrapped in, some stones begin to weather, The edges are crispy, and a little touch will drop the next big piece. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Hopkins occasionally walks up the wall along the crumbling path to go for a walk, sometimes he will fall into meditation, standing at the end of the wall that is about to collapse Unmoving, his body is thin and long, and at first glance it looks like a lonely seabird perched on an unnatural cliff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the weather is fine, he plays some songs, on this lonely platform, with a strong and heavy one from the middle of the eighteenth century. The Flemish two-layered harpsichord in Antwerp, Belgium. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The harpsichord is similar in shape to the modern grand piano, but the strings are played with a feather pipe instead of a hammer. Each string is played by a feather tube or hard leather dial fixed to the wooden post at the end of each key. At the top of the other side of the strut is a small piece of felt that acts as a damper, which is pronounced when the key is actually pressed, and does not continue to sound after the key is released. In addition, although the piano was born in the 18th century, it still has no pedals, which means that its players must let their hands leave the keys when they want to adjust the sound, and they cannot pass the Venice add-drop. The pedal adjusts the volume. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, there are not many people who play the harpsichord in a skillful manner (except for professionals), its sound is clear, pure, with a metallic texture. However, because only the feathers and leather dials were used to pluck the strings, the volume was thin and the contrast was weak. So, as early as the eighteenth century, it was replaced by the emerging stringed instrument, the piano. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its maintenance and repair is also a problem. Not everyone can understand the use of crow feathers like Hopkins to make a new dial--in Florence, the ghoul once got a very good ancient Harpsichord, but unfortunately he left the rush, did not bring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A subordinate of Chegal managed to get the piano from a bad collector. The maintenance is very good, beautiful, and the coffin is made. The resonance box has been hard and firm for hundreds of years, with eight black spiral legs holding a colorful body depicting the country dance scene. Anthony Hopkins sits in front of the keyboard and the collar of the shirt opens slightly, revealing pale The loose trousers of the skin and linen are blown to the side by the sea breeze. His waist is straight, bare feet, and the toes are stepping on the black bracket. The thin, pointed and long fingers like the spider legs are no longer black and white. The distinct keys moved happily. He saw Sasha standing at the door, did not speak, and blinked at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big Hopkins played a simple and bright polyphonic music with only six irregular upswings. Sasha heard this. The first song, Slakati's g minor, the kitten fugue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come on, dear," Anthony Hopkins shouted softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha learned his father's appearance and took off his shoes, walking barefoot from the bedroom to the roof, the stone's ground is a bit cold, the sand brought by the sea breeze The residue left by the weathering was squeaking at the soles of the feet. Sasha did not notice this at all. He walked over and Anthony Hopkins moved his body to make a place for his son. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The space in front of the keyboard is very small, but fortunately not sitting here is Chegal and Besib, but another pair of father and son, Hopkins Out of the arm, holding his son's waist, Sasha raised his arm and pulled the shirt on his back. The boy's body temperature was higher than that of the adult. Big Hopkins felt like he was holding the sun that had fallen into the deep sea, and the heat from the child. The internal body of the body is constantly coming out and infiltrating into the tight body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great Hopkins put his right hand back on the keys, he got a head, and Sasha put his left hand and followed the music The beginning of the bombing - compared to the cheerful and fast cat fug, Bach's Gothenburg variation part of the rhythm of the previous part of the rhythm is much more soothing, Big Hopkins almost casually followed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha’s fingers are still not up to the length of Anthony Hopkins, but it’s not a big hindrance. The harpsichord originally only needed three or four. Fingers, thumbs are rarely used. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bright moonlight is unmistakably coated with a layer of bright silver for stones, beaches and sea water. It is the largest and most magnificent in the history of music. It is also the greatest variation in the chest of stone fortress, sitting on the edge of the window. Galle shrugged his nose. "Get another plate of cheese and wine." He said, "Is there ice cream, what ice cream is there today?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Chocolate, mint and rum, you can add raisins and biscuits, or olives and honey." Old Andriana replied respectfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Chegal took a moment to think about it: "Okay," he waved his thick palm: "Add it."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside with Chegal, Bessie, who lives on the top floor, sighs and hides in a blanket and wraps his head with a feather pillow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great Hopkins closed his eyes slightly, he liked the Gothenburg Variations, whether it was a harpsichord or a piano, he had listened to it and played many times. It is the most profound of the memory twice, the last time he escaped from prison and he killed Sasha's mother, the young and beautiful Catherine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beautiful music makes him happy, stable, energetic, and able to concentrate well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can play smoothly without watching the keyboard, so when the music turns into a lyrical style, he slightly squints his head and looks at his child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha, who was fully engaged in the performance, did not notice, or said, it didn’t matter, Anthony Hopkins often loved him so much when he was a child. Gazing at him intentionally, he was initially nervous, hesitant, confused, and other things that were difficult to discern, but as Sasha grew, the dark and dangerous parts became less and less, replaced by obvious peace of mind and happiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hop Hopkins suddenly caught a smile, a subtle but apparently a smile that couldn’t help but, and Sasha seemed to think of something ridiculous that made him intolerable. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just thought of Besib." Sasha said: "You know, the school has a piano room and a very good piano, and then one day, our The music teacher played the first song in it. He asked me what the song was. I told him that it was the fifth symphony of Ludwig van Beethoven."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;</div>
