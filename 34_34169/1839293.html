The testimony. Although he died, he still spoke because of this letter. -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You want to strengthen your strength." Sasha said calmly: "For me, it is not difficult."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat on the only chair in the room, and Heyman Stronga was in front of him, the distance between the two was very close, near As long as Sasha raises his hand, he can touch the forehead of the senior: "And, there is no danger, nothing at all." He said softly: "I also know what to do. But the biggest problem is, "The ghoul's son showed a fleeting smile under the golden twilight: "Bless what you have given me, I am in a very unstable state, Mr. Strong, my strength is My body is boiling and roaring, I can't control it, just now, sorry, I can't quite figure out how long we have been here, let me think so, not long ago, I almost killed myself because of this. Friends and brothers - I believe you have seen the consequences - everyone The ability is different, it will be difficult to say what will become after the enhancement, but the outcome after the loss of control is quite good guess, the best one is death, bad, or worse, I can't guess."... He was silent for a while, giving Heyman time to think, and then spread his hands small: "Of course, if you are willing to wait a few days... I can't guarantee, but..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no time." Heyman said: "There is no time," he repeated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You may die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Lord will give strength to his people. The Lord He will give peace to his people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not the Lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" You are the Messiah, the anointed one of God, the chosen person of the Lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...This is a glory title." He said: "It’s just that most of the end is not good." The first one to be confirmed as the Messiah was Jesus. He was finally nailed to the cross by the Romans, although he was resurrected three days later - Sasha confirmed that he did not This ability. After that, the "pseudo Messiah" appeared frequently, not to mention the fact that Ajiba Ben Joseph was cut down by the Romans in 132 AD, and the unknown Jewish "Messiah" of the 12th century was repeated. His coverage. Was beheaded by the caliph at the time, as was the case of Thomas in the 16th century. Savatay Sebbi, who was captured by the Turks in the 17th century, converted to Islam for his own life and played two world wars. People are more than expected to have a Messiah to lead them out of war, hunger and poverty. There are more people who claim to be called Messiah. The most similar thing is that they end up... quite "wonderful" . "Well, I don't think it's important to have a title," said Little Hopkins. "Mr. Strong, I want to know. Is Bishb. Is it still alive?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heyman paused for a moment, as if he didn't understand why he asked this question: "Alive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Anthony Hopkins?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Alive, at least before leaving our sight.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“What about other people?”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All are alive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...very good." Sasha said: "So. Please rely again. Come over."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He put his hand on the neck of Heyman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Messiah." Anthony Hopkins tone gently Say, and cross your fingers on the chest, "That is a glory title, but unfortunately the role of this honor is difficult to get a good end." He observed the gang of people in front of him, everyone who was looked at him I can't help but turn my eyes away from him. Including "heads." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bloody smell on his body is dizzy, the iris is dark red, and the black barley is as sharp as a needle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't understand why the 'institution' is willing to tolerate this..." The person behind the "head" said that he thought it was very quiet and edible. The ghoul's gaze fell on him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They just tolerate my reasons and the reasons for tolerating you are basically the same." Hopkins muttered: "This is where I am most unbearable." One."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obvious. The guy didn't understand. He might want to say something. The people around him pulled him: "Well, let's go." The man whispered, "Close your mouth and don't notice the stinky stupidity." Are you coming out of your throat?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "head" can only be heard when doing nothing: "What are you not going to do?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you do? I think my things are done." Hopkins nodded politely to the crowd: "If you need it, head "When he said the word, he was like greeting a dog or a cat: "I will go back to the hotel to take a shower and change my clothes. After all, this dress seems to be suitable for Halloween. By the time, if I can, I will come back to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ominous meaning contained in the last sentence made the "head" straighten the corner of his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sasha Hopkins is in Stronga."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" That's right, as you said," Hopkins said happily: "Since he is what they think of the 'Messiah' - the Savior, it means that they will serve him and look after him. I don't have to worry about him, isn't it?" He made a wicked gesture: "Don't be too disappointed, head, I thought you knew I wasn't Catherine."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He made a short, cold laughter, stepping back two steps and disappearing into the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do we chase?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Head" shook his head, his mind It was seen by Hopkins. Fortunately, the ghoul didn’t say much, but he hesitated, Catherine was not there, Hopkins... and Martin... the head didn’t dare to let him have anything to do with it. The first two have a chance to share a room. Although the people around him are all capable, one or two of them are still very good, but they are still rookies. They still need to hone, but the object of honing must not be Supervised and ruthless, strong and powerful opponent. The wounds that Hopkins and his son left to the institution a few years ago have not yet fully healed, and the countries and other organizations that have gradually valued the abilities have consistently competed with each newcomer. Today's institutions can't afford the extra losses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey," one suddenly whispered, "Do you feel anything?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Head" face turned white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Head" is also a person who has been baptized by Sasha forces He certainly knows what happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hyman trembles, the external force is slowly and accurately invading his body, his bones. His blood vessels and flesh are shaking, his nerves are numb, his skin is tight, and his instincts shout and want to resist – it is digging his internal organs, even deeper, the heart, the brain and the soul, it is changing them, correcting They, strengthen them - precisely because of this, his reason is willing to fight against his instinct. No, don't refuse, this is what you pray for. What you want, what you long for - the whole process is so long, painful and fearful that he can't maintain his initial posture, fall to the ground, and spread his limbs. Constantly breathing, tears and sweat flow uncontrollably, drenching the clothes and the carpet underneath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe it's not just sweat, a disgusting smell that permeates the air, and even the rich rose fragrance can't be covered – the loose muscles don't seem to be where people can see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He voluntarily took off the glorious crown, along with the power that has always protected it. Delivered to the person in front - delivered to the Messiah. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lord, help me..." He was weak, "Help me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Sasha did not speak. He held his hand, leaned down from the chair, and watched Hyman Strange Jacob calmly. The latter does not look much better than those who have injected a lot of drugs. The rich muscles and skin seem to disappear in tens of seconds after the film stunts are processed, and the contours of the face collapse. The eyes are dark and the cheeks are sallow. Only those eyes are like a fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it felt?" Sasha took his hand: "Power."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Hayman closed his eyes and then opened: "...I felt..." It was totally different from what he imagined. To be correct, the opposite is true, not from heaven but from hell. But...he did feel it. He never felt so clearly that his strength was close at hand. If it could breathe, he would have felt a little bit of damp and warm wind on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well," Sasha clap his hands casually. "You can go and want to do something."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hyman's movement slowly climbed from the ground, he looked terrible, but it can be said to be very good: "I am not sure," he said, hoarse voice: "...maybe me Will need your help, once again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said that opening the door is neither dangerous nor difficult for me," Sasha Back leaning on the chair, the golden eyes are shining under the light, "I will be here waiting for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Hopkins certainly can't go back to the hotel, he only needs a small room, a room, quiet, warm, of course. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He landed in the garden, surrounded by the fragrance of wild chrysanthemums. The faint light had no effect on the ghouls. He stood in the yard for a while and walked to the back door. The back door of the house was opened in the kitchen, and the long fingers opened the door with just two twists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dangerous intruder walked silently, but suddenly the sound of a soft crash and the leaking orange-yellow twilight light made him stand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A child wearing a formal pajamas, that is, a long pajamas from the neck to the knees, standing next to the open refrigerator, his hands are still tight Holding a jar, bare feet. He looked at him as if he was a man who came out of the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The child's eyes widened, his mouth opened, and the jar fell from his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins caught the jar, the jar was open, and there was a gel-like body, wild chrysanthemum and honey, which was very similar in color to his eyes. The scent blends together—a shallow depression is slowly reverting to its original shape—he sticks out his tongue and licks it, hand-mixed sauce, no flavors, additives, and preservatives, with pieces of strawberries and apples. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boy is at most seven or eight years old, with a slender and soft neck, and the smell on his body reminds Hopkins of his son (the boys are always a bit like each other) ) The reddish-brown eyes screamed briskly: "The woman said, I know that the Messiah, (that is, what is called Christ) is coming. He will come and tell us everything." - Do you know where this sentence comes from?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The child has his eyes wide open, he does not understand what happened, but it is derived from the instinct of the young The voice told him that he should listen to this person, "John," he hesitated and said: "Chapter 4... Twenty-five."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Very correct," Ghoul said. "You have a pair of devout good parents, dear, please remember to remind them to do a grateful mass."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He put The boy was caught under the armpit (like a bag of flour) and he stepped up the stairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before he did not forget to hook the door of the refrigerator with his toes, let the whole house fall into the dark again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
