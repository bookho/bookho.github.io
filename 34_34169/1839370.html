			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lab in the deepest part of the Tower of Babel looks a lot like a mental hospital, or according to what many people think, it is a good thing. The detained mental hospital, which is closed with madmen in gray uniforms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine lay under a "crazy" gray uniform on a chair that feels quite comfortable and soft (it looks like a dental chair) ), she took off her coat and trousers before entering the room. She had only a thin shirt that could only cover the roots of the thigh. The sensitive touch of the abilities told her that there was more under the leather and sponge. A lot of things - such as metal probes and cables. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Easy," said a voice, "You can close your eyes, it doesn't matter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Catherine moved, the leather on the chair was real suede, and her thigh skin was in close contact with each other coldly: "I am fine," she said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So let's talk," the voice said, "as detailed as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The light in the room was not strong, it was soft, it could even be said to be a bit dark, but Catherine closed her eyes: "The whole monastery fell into the river with the broken rock formations, and I could find very few things..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just two months ago, handed the organization a bunch of tiny metal fragments, hoping they could find something useful from them - there is a The middle-aged woman is very good at restoring the things that have been destroyed and shattered. At first she used her power foolishly on the worn heel, the child’s broken basketball and her husband’s classic car, and it was extremely accidental. The spy of the institution discovered her. After receiving the involuntary test, she became a member of the organization and agreed to be "monitored." As a reward, the agency gave her 3,000 yuan a month, every time she needed her to contribute. She can also get a bonus of one thousand yuan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She doesn’t know what she’s recovering—it's a big value baby. Maybe there are still two lives above, or she can guess, but she is not greedy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agency reinstated the storage element that was only the size of the fingernail, before returning it. They managed to look at the contents inside. Hey, let's make it to the head, it's a Pandora's box, and it's all poisonous, there is no hope - it's not others who cultivate these deadly locusts, it's "Samel," the crazy traitor. The organization of the abilities created. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He can't continue to do his work in peace and order?" A member of the organization yelled angrily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is doing it," another member said: "Samuel also took our reserve players last Friday."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was jealous of several people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We must handle this matter cautiously," said the third person. "You can find the roots by following the branches. Samuel is a rotten fruit. But we No one can deny that it grows out of us... God bless, the names of the abilities are almost equal to the criminals, and I don't want to have any traces of horror and ties."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What should we do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"First match to figure out everything," the man said: "Then let's consider something else."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So. In addition to the chip, Catherine appeared in front of the staff. They negotiated with the agency, and they also hope that the abilities will help. The searchers are like picking up fine nets in the lower reaches of the river like fishing sands. They have picked up countless gravel, metal sheets and wood chips. . Plants and semi-dead locusts - the piles of debris were found in a squashed drawer, one of the few valuable clues they found, and the other one was seen by Besib and Sasha. The metal wall that covers the emergency evacuation passage, the wall is twisted like a chew, but after correction. It can still be seen from the above inkjet that it is an Abraham sacrifice map. When Abraham prepared to sacrifice his son Isaac to God, it was the angel Samuel who stopped him and put it on the altar. A lamb was used instead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the final "Samuel" was nailed to the trial bench, or the chip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The upper class of the organization also discussed whether it should erase the things in this chip. Or re-break it and tell yourself that there is nothing you can do - the head and Catherine say that his brother is one of the decision makers, so he knows something a little more than others - fortunately, they eventually decided to return it. Recovering chips, because those people are not sure if there will be more chips. If one of them is readable, then the "institution" that lies will probably be considered to be in the same place as "Samel". . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As far as we know," the voice said, "Your little nephew is there too."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine’s fingers couldn’t help but grab the armrest of the chair: He is the victim," she replied as she tried to use a steady voice: "There are three children and an adult with him. He is falling."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Four children, three of whom are abilities."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Besib is a friend of my nephew," Catherine answered without hesitation: "Lila is the supervised by Hopkins - she was ordered to protect my nephew."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Anthony Hopkins knows Sasha. Hopkins will be in danger?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," Catherine squeezed her fist on the armrest. "He didn't know, he let Lila go just Because...because there are Boa in the ranks. Douglas. Boa. Douglas is also a versatile person, his relationship with my nephew...not very good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ; "The situation is the same as water and fire," the voice said. "We also did a little investigation, but it is strange, you should love your nephew?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But are you dating Boa. Douglas?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stefan woke up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lives in the nearest room to Saints Jared. Prior to this, this honor belonged to Hayman Strange, and Stefan Indifferent, he can live wherever he lives, but Jared hopes that he can live close to himself, and it is best to be by his side, at his feet, so that he can send and use him anytime, anywhere. If he was not able to control Stefan, or control the power in his body, he would certainly do so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is still in the blue, Stefan squats, prays to the omnipresent Lord, then takes off the burlap shirt, red luo upper body, pick up the suspension The whip under the icon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is his glory alone, but today he is unlikely to continue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
