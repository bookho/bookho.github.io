			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the night, it’s boring to be a receptionist at the hotel, because you can’t sleep, you can’t find something interesting, and Can't be dazed—a young man with straight eyes and a straight face, standing facelessly behind the counter at the height of the chest will reminiscent of the beginning of some classic horror films, the owner of the hotel believes that their fragile little hearts Maybe it will be hurt and irritated - so, although in Grande, this hotel is unique, but as a competent service staff, Hans must play the spirit of twelve points at any time, courtesy The smile, carefully received every man, woman and children who came into the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The residents of Grand Town have their own homes, they are more willing to let relatives and friends live in their own houses, only occasionally, for example : A pair of love and affection, but do not want to let people know that their relationship is more intimate than the men and women who will come to borrow a room, they may not come together, but Hans's sharp and sharp eyes can always detect the clues. He will look at the situation after a period of time ringing a male, or a woman rented a room, by the name of the hotel to send two glasses of cheap champagne or wine mixed with soda - when he leaves the room, the tray There will be a lot of expensive tips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time people will behave more scared, sometimes their lover will immediately get up and leave, but they will soon know that Hans is knowing how A good-looking man, he never drinks, does not contaminate the dangerous powder, does not like to chat with people, never regrets, and does not go to see a psychiatrist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hans is more familiar with a widow, actually there is nothing, but she can’t fix it... there is a priest, he Not a grande, but another small village about fifty miles from Grande, and a little identity. I am almost a professional woman who can be a grandmother... Oh, yes, and Ossien Douglas, who was a school doctor at Grande Boarding School. He has a house in Grand Town, but occasionally he will meet with the graduated female students in the hotel. It is a handsome man and he is very frustrated. After he was expelled by Grande, Hans was very depressed. For a while, he had to give up the double-door refrigerator he had been watching for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine Stallin began to date with Mr. Douglas around the day, Hans estimates that her age should be between 28 and 34 Before, and Douglas was a minor boy. He was crazy about this age-old adult who was almost twice as old - Hans never bothered their date, although he didn't know if it was a date, because Ms. Catherine's to Douglas. The attitude is cold and perfunctory, even if she comes every time, she looks like she can go to the crowning ceremony of the king at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time the lady arrives first. Then Mr. Douglas rushed in. Except for the first time, Catherine Stallin left the room after three to four minutes, leaving Mr. Douglas alone in the empty room. Out of the cautiousness of a waiter and law-abiding citizen, Hans used the spare key to open the door to see the situation of Boa Douglas, who looked like he was taking some illegal drugs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suspects that this beautiful lady is doing something uncomfortable. He convinced a friend to install a monitoring probe in the room. What made him feel relieved was that they didn't see the powder in the small package, did not see the syringe, and did not have pills or pills. Catherine just touched Boa. Douglas, the latter fell happily. "My dog ​​is like this when I am scratching my belly." His friend said: "It seems that this is just a unique game. Even if one of them is not yet adult..." He shrugged: "But there is almost no contact between them, there is no possibility of an improper relationship - at least in this room."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He removed the monitoring probe, which is illegal. Hans asked him to drink a bottle of pure malt whisky as a reward, and then recorded it in Mr. Douglas's account. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boa. Douglas paid the money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, Hans is no longer worried, especially when their time in the room is so short, not too short for the lady to take off Under and wearing clothes, he is curious about what kind of game it is, and can make the arrogant little Douglas so happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Hans relied on all sorts of quirks to guess the time, the bell hanging on the door rang, "The lady" opened the door and left. Come in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hans looked at his watch and there was a quarter of an hour before ten o'clock. “Is the eggnog delivered to your room at ten o'clock?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It’s still ten o'clock,” Catherine replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now she is very familiar with her power and is free to control. The moment she walks into the room, Boa. Douglas is waking up between his legs. Sticky and slippery, the body and limbs became soft and weak due to long hours of joy, even the brain became a bit sluggish, Catherine leaned down and gently clicked on his forehead, a tiny creature The current broke through his prefrontal lobes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You should go back." Catherine said, sitting back in the chair, according to Anthony Hopkins's instructions, her demeanor and body language are milder and kinder than before, she always remembers her when she looks at Douglas. Nephew - this made her eyes involuntarily filled with concern and love, but when Douglas proposed to want to be close to her, she still refused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boo. Douglas is gone, he doesn't seem to feel sad or angry because of Catherine's alienation and indifference - Catherine touched that only after he left With the door handle of the palm of the hand, I feel the emotions - this teenager who is deeply trapped in the deformed love is even a little happy and satisfied, she can put a snack for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At ten o'clock, the hot eggwort was brought up, and the waiter remembered her preference and added double the sugar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This should have been a sweet and peaceful night - both Douglas and Big Hopkins can go to hell, Catherine licks a thick alcoholic drink. While kicking open the high heels and tearing off the silk dress wrapped around the body, it made her feel very stuffy. The bathroom attached to the room had an old-fashioned four-legged bathtub, which opened the window and the cold evening breeze would carry the jasmine fragrance. Her bare body, the hotel is also equipped with pure essential oils. There is also a comfortable big bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But a phone ruined it all, it was a "head." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come back," said the head. "We must go to the monastery again. You have to look again, carefully."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened?" Catherine asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." The microphone was silent for a few seconds, and apparently the head was considering whether to tell Catherine the message: "It's a locust - those 蜱The worm is against the abilities."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know if it’s artificial negligence, some locusts from the grass and forest near the monastery escaped. In the laboratory, the people who are bitten by them, the average person is only fever, pain and swelling, but the abilities are not good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High fever, vomiting, coma, organ failure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some abilities have even abilities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
