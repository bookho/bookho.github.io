			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They found a total of three lambs, five piglets, and a dying calf in order to prevent it from struggling to break the glass box, its feet They were all interrupted, screwed to an incredible angle, the body was wet, and it was hard to gasp, and the fine yellow-yellow hairs were all fat red-colored mites. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They don't raise grass," Besib said: "It's a locust."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp There are only low wattages of purple-red lights, but as long as they are willing to see the unabsorbed mites that are attached to the blades and stalks, as fine as sesame, and the smaller locust larvae, the nymphs will not be A difficult thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but what do they do with mites? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think of a possibility." Sasha said that his expression was cold and stiff: "My father once showed me a copy of several documents. ——The archives that should have existed in the original are well preserved in the National Archives, but they are empty.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib listened carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a saying inside: 'We should conduct an organized, large-scale biochemical weapons experiment project, and all interested institutions can participate.'" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha said: "The history of locusts dates back to the biblical age. There used to be more than one saint and saint, bishops and kings, and countless knights and farmers. The locust bites, but there has never been a case of death in the history of being killed by mites. The tsutsugamushi appeared three hundred years ago. Note that no one has died. From then on, locusts have become One of the killers of mankind? The earliest example of traceability was that seventy years ago, not one, not two, but a large-scale outbreak, a small town, Lemi town, infected with sixty-nine Adults and twenty-two children, of which thirteen adults and nine children die, the rest need to fight the sequela for a lifetime. You can imagine a 42-year-old male before he was sick. Can easily pick up 80 pounds The casks went a mile. After fighting for 18 years with the mites, he could not even lift a bag of two pounds of flour, his hands twisted and deformed, his vocal cords became thin and he could not speak. He was numb; his wife had been able to play nine instruments, a music teacher in the town, healthy and beautiful, but after the outbreak of tsutsugamushi, she was forced to quit her job. She gave up all her hobbies because of her fingers. The headache made her want to cut them all down. In addition, she must also store every effort to fight the headache, comprehensive fatigue, fever, moodiness and depression caused by the virus."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are doing biochemical experiments with mites. Seventy years ago, until now," Besib said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No one will admit this, some scientists are still saying that the lethality of the worms carried by the worms of Baghdoff is not certain. The large-scale outbreak of locusts is caused by the increase in trees and grasses and the humidness of the environment after people pay attention to ecological environment protection. The environment has become suitable for the growth of locusts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you think there will be reporters who want to see this lovely little monastery?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," Sasha said: "You Identity-sensitive, Besib, your actions will be seen as an attack on the government fu."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here is the political fu?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no estimate," Sasha said, starting to search around at the same time. With your eyes: "But you have to know that Sami Town is still a forbidden word in some places and people now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you looking for?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We can't just go out and do nothing." Under the purple-red light, the boy shrouded in a bloody light said: "I hope The researchers here have prepared something, in the event of an accident. They can use those things to kill all the mites."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the movie, they will Put a dozen liquefied gas tanks and an ignition stick in the corner at your fingertips."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are in reality," Sasha said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's it," Besib said: "We can't find a match."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;He smiled helplessly, just want to say something, he felt the ground under his feet vibrate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha was thrown into the air by a huge force, and it was uncompromising. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He almost hit the zenith of aluminum alloy, and Besib slammed out his "hand" - the long hand was not so much Down, it is better to say that it was rolled down. He barely considered the time. He seized Sasha and another violent shock wave came again. He was also smashed out, but he still had time to force the sand. In his arms, his face is deformed, and his body is also. He bends down and protects his unblooded brother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hot wind blew his skin, and he felt like he was blisters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crushed glass, grass blades, metal flakes, small pieces of flesh and blood, and countless locusts, like the raindrops, in all directions, flapping their Face and body, want to get into their skin and puncture into their flesh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bissib’s other "hand" promptly tore off an aluminum plate that is as big as a sunscreen cover for a car (why should thank those researchers who do not hesitate to pay for it) ?), used it to "roll" himself and Sasha, Sasha hugged him tightly, they rolled on the ground, and there were sharp things to poke through the aluminum plate, both Besib and Sasha heard it. The other party's snoring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the "reel", all the scenery is chaotic, jumping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha heard Besib’s swearing words, he knew that this should not be, but he wanted to laugh, but the hope of Besib was reached, that is The form is a bit wrong - he wants a liquefied gas tank that can destroy all the mites, and now it is an explosion that can destroy them and mites. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are often bridges in the film and the criminals. In order to eliminate the evidence and traces, criminals will set bombs at important places, waiting for the protagonist to cast a net - locust The researchers probably think so too. They may not be the ones they want to meet, but the mercenaries. When they search for information or collect locusts, an explosion can leave everything behind. Here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pig with a burnt back hair panicked over Besib’s eyes and it knocked down a miraculously standing on two feet Glass box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The box fell down, the "reel" was stuck by it, Besib’s headache was cracking, his sight could not help but wandering around, he didn’t know Not because of the fact that your eyes are moving around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha took the lead in getting rid of the "reel" and then dragged out Besib. The situation in Besib was better than he thought, at least there was humanity. profile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame burned the resin wall and the ground, producing a odor and black mist,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The constant explosion of the connection swayed the entire culture room, and Sasha almost fell again with the besib on his back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A man grabbed his arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Billy'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Marian." The man said that the voice was weak. Powerless, but the heat on your fingers is not so scary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie lifted the body of Sasha from the other side, and the four men clung together and crossed the last door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They didn’t dare to stay and ran forward desperately. Every time a door was passed, “Mary Ann” closed the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire resistance of resin materials is very low, and the fire spreads to their starting point and end point is only a matter of time - fortunately they have the last step to go, even if they have endless troubles . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vibration on the ground also continues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire baptistery was originally set up as a honey-filled flytrap, and the medieval monastery was extremely rich, nobility and The knights never mind the occasional search for God's dwellings, where the monks hid incalculable redemption money and gold, silver, and copper-cast sacred objects in the basement, using locks and sophisticated institutions to keep them safe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dean certainly knows how to open the basement safely. The medieval dean can choose to keep his life or money, but today the dean has no choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ramp has been completely blocked, the baptistery is slowly and elegantly shaking its body, and the unique double wall of the Romanesque building is skillfully crafted by the craftsmen. Set to be the most desperate trap - first the inner stone, followed by the layered gravel, and finally the outer stone, each stone, regardless of size, fell into the interior of the baptismal hall, waiting for them When it is finished, the original baptistery will become a short hill, where thieves and masters are buried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A soldier is dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His still living companion waved his hand to the leader, he found a good place to hide - after the chandelier fell, a piece was used on the vault The boulder has its side, it is dumped to the right, and the bronze lamp branches that are longer than the baptismal pool are bent into the air, and there are stones that bend them, and the branches are bent down and entangled. Together, a hollow is formed protectively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
