			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[[[cp|w:250|h:190|a:r|u:/rs/201012/24Anthony Hopkins sat In the armchair, the elbows hold the arm of the crocodile skin, the fingers cross, the palm of the hand falls on the abdomen, and the head naturally leans back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he once taught to Catherine, he built a memory of his own in the brain: the blueprint comes from his grandfather. The old mansion of Lavenham, an old and quiet old house, vast and empty, with high ceilings, dark brown beams with vines, icons, exorcism symbols and house construction In the ages, the walls were covered with durable eucalyptus siding. The sun shined through a small piece of glass framed by iron lattices. The furniture and floors of oak and walnut were warm and sparkling, just like It was coated with lard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony spent his childhood and boyhood here, he is very familiar with it, and the layout of the whole house is very similar to his mind, he almost does not have to change What--the corridor is full of masterpieces of the artists of various periods that he appreciates. The walls in the library are neatly arranged with the professional works and pastimes he has seen. The daggers and short knives are displayed in the weapons room. , swords, pistols and shotguns, the two favorite bands in the hall are on the go, the room is full of a variety of light brown cigars and the wines he has tasted - he wants to try that problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going up the stairs, the patients on the second floor and the flank of the room are surrounded by patients, friends and acquaintances at all stages, and they basically keep seeing him for the first time. The look, if necessary, can also give them the final look - but that would be a bit crippling, because several of them were once his mouthfuls. He occasionally greets them, listens to their screams or talks to them - know that there are many talented, knowledgeable, and versatile people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third floor belongs to him only, and later "Catherine", he gave her the right to enter some of the rooms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She likes the embroidered room of the female niece, where there is plenty of sunshine, fresh air, and a table and wicker chair made of twisted branches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the case today. When he walked in, "Catherine" was kneeling on the rattan lounge chair, hiding behind a large bottle of white roses, her hand With a book, a dark brown leather cover and a hot gold headline, the beige-colored book side has been groped for a bit dirty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Mr. Hopkins walked over, she woke up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He ran over, kneeling beside her, her hand rubbing her waist, and her head buried in her abdomen, the grievance was like being bullied by an outsider. Little child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He told her to meet her twin sister today: "In addition to the eyes," he said: "You are all like nothing."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't remember how she looks." "Catherine" admitted: "The foster mother hates me for keeping the previous things, whether it's photos and letters, diaries or memories. - But I do remember that her eyes are different from me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is only a little difference, I mean appearance, others I still I don't know much," Anthony Hopkins replied thoughtfully: "You see, she works in the 'institution'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And I am a," "Catherine" replied: "Speak up, I think we are quite like it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If Sasha wants to meet her Face, say something?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That’s what you see, that’s her aunt.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Then she looked at the child's father and rarely really got upset: "Catherine." He said: "Maybe I shouldn't kill you." Sasha longs for the mother, but he can only provide a mosaic in the small The photos and verbal descriptions in the pendant, by these things alone, Sasha could not invite "Catherine" to her memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is nothing," "Catherine" said calmly: "There will always be such a day."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ariau Hotel in the depths of the Amazon jungle is more than 500 kilometers away from the nearest city of Manaus, visitors are arriving Or leave here, there are only two ways, one is to go up and down the river (down), the other is to take a small plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of guests come, a group of guests to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disregarding Catherine’s, Jack retired and set the time and location to go back. When the boat arrived in the afternoon, they dragged a simple suitcase and waited for a wing in the reception hall. They watched the new passengers rushing into the Ariau from the green wooden trestle. They were brightly dressed and exaggerated, regardless of adults. The children are holding cameras and cameras everywhere and there are only one person, so he is particularly outstanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A priest." Catherine, who has been squinting out the window, said she tried to direct Jack’s attention to anything other than her, but just like the first few Again, this time, it failed. Jack didn't bother to turn around: "Dear," he said. "Even if God has a vacation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Catherine is going crazy, this damn Jack, from noon today, he is like a good lover of a fascinating agent, clutching her arm or shoulder, even if it is going to the toilet - he Not waiting outside the door, but waiting outside the cubicle - if someone comes in, he will say politely: "Sorry, madam, the toilet water valve has something wrong, we are expediting repair. You can use the hall The restroom on the right."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She didn't want to leave, most of the members of the action group were extremely changed and brutal (in fact, they and the beasts they hunt for It’s not too much to go.) Catherine doesn’t think they’re because of scruples. A little girl's safe and easy to miss a chance to get rich or famous ...... Catherine have more than once heard of who kill hostages Yi Shi companions in action, but never heard them be punished or dismissed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man is not "ghoul" is irrelevant for Catherine, she only hopes to take her sister's daughter before the action group is coming - retreat Wan Bu said that if not, she would warn the bastard and let him run away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, it’s best to leave her niece, Catherine thought, though this hope is both ridiculous and ridiculous. Even if it is taken away, it is much better than staying in a dangerous area where it will become a bloody hunting ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She even wants to use her new power, but how can it not recall how it was produced and how it was "launched". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new guests sneaked into the reception hall of the hotel, and the cool fresh air in the reception hall made their spirits The tour guide went to the counter to get the booked room card. They wandered around the hall in groups of three and five, constantly shooting things that surprised them... a small squirrel monkey, a swept parrot, up to Twenty feet of lotus leaves, largemouth fish clustered under the lotus leaves, even a common Amazon red dragonfly can cause a shout of one after another. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack raised his fingers tiredly, massaged his temples and eyebrows slyly, his stomach sinking like he swallowed a quarter of Amazon - Ominous premonition is like peeled onions, more and more clear and thick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His hunch, especially the bad hunch, has never been a mistake so far, Jack only hopes that this time too. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was another scream, and Catherine thought they saw something new, but then her arm was caught by Jack, she hadn’t had time yet. When it was issued, Jack was pulled up from the sofa and stepped back a few steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The roof seems to have something in it - and then just a moment of effort, a large circular spot appears on the dark ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, Mommy. A big hole." The first thing I found out was a little girl who was held in her arms by her mother. She was more than she was present. People must be tall, and they like to keep looking around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adults looked at the place where the little finger pointed, and an irregular hole appeared on the roof made of logs and cement, accompanied by mud With grass foam, it is constantly increasing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is something digging it!" someone shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't need to say that I know." Catherine murmured, her arm was held tighter by Jack, and she took a quick turn and glanced at him. The face is worse than the frog specimen soaked in formalin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A conical head sticks out of the hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People are quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tree stalks of the white jade with white cross-spots look like a curious child, gracefully and slowly hangs down from the hole. The body, the sun shines on its scales, the scales are shiny, and the small silver-gray eyes are only one hand away from the nearest visitor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It stretched out the letter and touched the face that was full of grease. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poor, obese guy is shaking like a good quality jelly, he slowly opens his mouth, people can almost see crowded eyes The screams in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, he didn’t get the interest of that pretty tree, it swayed around and turned into a number of "z" characters, slowly shrinking Go back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...it's gone." I don't know who is talking. Some of the guests have already shown uncontrollable smiles and excitement, including the little fat man who has just been scared to pee in his pants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is really a memorable opening ceremony, isn’t it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
