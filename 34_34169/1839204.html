			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, logically, the hero and the beauty saved by him are sticking together, they rush to take off their clothes, kiss, touch , kneading and squatting, rolling around on the carpet, doing, loving, hysterically, hysterically, yes, yes, the end of each movie is like this, and every time you change a woman, mixed, Purebred, Western, Oriental... He did the same, one is better than one, one is younger than one, and one is more than one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very excited now, he is a brave and fearless warrior, just now, he killed a wicked, an abominable criminal, one should live The devil in hell for hundreds of years, a hot air rushed from the finger of his trigger, rushing his arm and brain along his arm, he could hear the blood vessels in his ear slamming, he closed Put your eyes on, look forward to the heat sinking, so that another important part of him is heated up - but today I don’t know what it is, his bottom is always soft and collapsed, he is hard on the woman’s chest and legs, The face is tempered, but it is always futile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well," he got up and panted and said, "We need a little adjustment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp He climbed up, grabbed the key on his neck, and took a pack of about a quarter of a gram from a locked cabinet. "It's very pure, ninety-nine percent." He dumped it in one Putting the silver spoon, igniting, and the blue smoke floated up, he immediately plunged it up and sucked them into the nostrils, and the woman wanted it, and pushed him away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman fell angrily to the ground, she knew that she could not get any benefit, and she no longer climbed up. The black man’s smashed head was only a few inches away from her hand with her fingernails. The blood and brains that flowed out covered her back, and with a little warmth, the woman looked and felt indifferently—first When she was scared, she almost went crazy, but she did not get hurt. When the effort is over, her employer will change back to the polite, chubby old man. She can get a thousand pieces each time, sometimes with a small gift, a gold ring or a few lipsticks. I was used to it very quickly. The torture of watching others died was far less than the pain and drug addiction that she had just become. Besides, she laughed stupidly and was killed as a bad person. Criminals, such people are always dying, not a shot or a heart is falling off the cliff. Either the monster is biting his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps that guy is really innocent, but that can only prove that he is a bad luck, the unlucky will die early, she has nothing to guilty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the lack of extra benefits from the employer made her very dissatisfied, so when she was crushed again. She did not give a response like the corpse next to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her employer doesn’t seem to care, he squats, like a pig, and is crying, his hand clutching her shoulder, he grabs It’s too tight. The fingers pierced into her flesh, and she screamed and kicked him - her resistance did not play a role. Instead, it aroused the fierceness caused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man had already smashed the pointed ear hat made of black silk, the sparse yellow hair was scattered in front of his forehead, and the sweat and tears were blurred. His eyes, the illusion dominates his thoughts and limbs, in the spiritual world of jealousy. He became a lonely hero he had been eager to become when he was a child. He was strong, intelligent, flexible and talented. Affectioned by countless people - he jumped between tall buildings, his ears whispering, the background is the dark night sky and the bright white moon. His, national, and human enemies jumped out one by one, but they were simply vulnerable in front of him. He waved his fists and flew their flesh and blood. He could hear their mourning and smell. They splattered with blood, he was proud and satisfied, but he did not let go of his vigilance. His biggest enemy has not yet appeared, he knows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw the person in an old newspaper, and with a glance he could know that this guy must be his life’s deadly enemy, one with wisdom and Power, a gentle and beast, the crime he planned is full of drama, his words and demeanor - even if it is murder, it looks so elegant and chic, he can't make it all the time, the reporters are crazy for him, his admirers are all over the western continent. Everywhere, someone created a website for him. The home page of the website is the famous six fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately issued a private reward of five million, an annual increase of 500,000. In the reward, it is best to say that the living, the spirit and the body are intact. If the body lacks some of the bounty discretion, the spirit... He said that it is worthless if it is crazy or becomes a vegetative person. He is eager to torture and kill the guy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fantasy, he and the dangerous criminal are tweaked together, very difficult, he has been in danger for several times, but he finally became a victory He rides on the prey and twists his neck with his hands. The sound of the neck fracture is so crisp. For a moment, he is awake. He immediately bows his head. The actual situation makes him feel depressed. He is not killing a "ghoul", but he is hired to act as " The victim". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s frustrating." He groaned, his heart was really calm. After a while, the person in charge of the deal would send someone to finish the game. The body of the nigger would be dug out of the bullet, and his mother would not recognize it. The way they look - they will find the right reasons to explain, there are always accidents in the prison. He can pay a sum of money and let them take the woman away. There are many forests in the vicinity, and they throw them in the air. The hungry wolves and bears can solve this little trouble in a day or two. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He may also be able to take the opportunity to ask the person who "receives the goods". Has the reward been lost? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sticky thing on his face, he reached out and touched it, red, that sly (the child scratched his face and paralyzed his body) He didn't feel it. He wiped the wound again. The strange touch made him tremble with disgust. What is the guy? He only remembers the "Ghouls," the group of reporters and the Federal Bureau agents. The nickname he started, isn’t it cool?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the name? He really doesn’t remember.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hopkins," a pleasing voice answered the question: "Anthony Hopkins."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat faintly I looked up at the man sitting on the high-back chair.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man was very thin, his knees were over the chair legs, so he shrugged slightly The body leaned forward slightly, and a pair of knuckles were crossed and hung in the middle of the knee. He had a pair of gray eyes. Almost all white hair was finished with hair oil and combed back. Light, the expression on the face is indescribable, people can find compassion and cruelty inside.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello," said the uninvited guest: "My The rewarder."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha prepared a second sauce, chicken The bones are made, the mushrooms are black pepper. Anyway, this time he invited Besib and Avery, the taste of the dishes can no longer be as desired as before - Sasha sometimes opens one or two innocence Little jokes. But they won't tease their guests at the table.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besb ​​has tasted both, it seems to be good, so he puts in front of him Two seasonings.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appetite of boys in development is always immeasurable. They ate the two-pound seven-star spot, the duck breast of a whole duck, a pound of salty bread for a meal, and a quart (capacity unit: about one liter) rum Raisin ice cream - per person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins is responsible for cooking. Besib was responsible for packing the dishes. Avery had to go to the room. They had already taken a shower when they came back. The dirty clothes were thrown in the light clothes basket. Avery took them and gave them to the management of the laundry. member. The rules of the Grand Boarding School are very loose in this regard. Students can wash themselves by paying a few coins or handing them over to the laundry manager. The charge is slightly higher, if you need to iron - such as Hopkins shirts and trousers, you have to add a tip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The shirt of this brand has two hundred yuan." The administrator said, he could not help but whistle: "If you iron it, hope him." Don't claim for me, or I will do it in the next few days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you know that this is two hundred dollars?" Avery asked . There is no sign on the shirt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have also seen good things," the administrator pulled the sleeves of the shirt: "thick silk and pure linen. Each piece has an arm sleeve." If it is less than one hundred and eighty dollars, I will swallow it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avery did not speak, can pay tens of thousands of dollars to stay here for one year Of course, people will not make a fuss about a two-hundred-yuan shirt. He remembers that there are at least two dozen such shirts in the wardrobes of Besib and Sasha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people he knows are never lacking in squandering idiots, but he always feels that these two people are different, but they are different, he also Can't say it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avery returned to their small suite, Sasha and Besib did not return to their bedroom, Besib was being beaten all over the body sandbag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a very regular silicone sandbag, red, with a fixed base, standing straight in the corner of the small hall. Besib took a step back in dance with a special thin glove, and then leaped gently about a quarter of a foot. He waved his left fist and slammed the bag like a cut off limb. The bag of the man's body with the head was dull and slammed, and it fell backwards in a firm posture. The snoring of the connecting part was both harsh and unpleasant, and Avery thought it would break off - no, It bounced back and greeted Besib's right fist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins' attention is focused on the game, the flat-panel self-illuminating soft display occupies half of the wall, and the shooting frisbee is shot from all sides of the screen, so fast that it can hardly be captured with the naked eye - Sasha holds the gun, Of course, it's just a simulated gun for the game, but it has the same feel and weight as the real gun. When the trigger pulls the trigger, it will slide back quickly. After stopping, the return spring will quickly reset the gun, resulting in recoil. A laser sighting device that can be removed is also attached to the gun body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha did not use the laser device, he stood and shot, the frisbee burst on the screen, no missing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What a pity," Avery said with amazement: "You shouldn't be part of the football team and the swimming club. Grande also has boxing and shooting clubs. "The talent in these two aspects has greatly exceeded football and swimming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishib smirked and smiled: "That can't be done," he said. "That's too unfair."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He came over, took off his gloves, picked up another game gun, and the speed of the Frisbee disappeared more than doubled. After a few seconds, no frisbee was fired. A red "win" flashed on the screen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are professional," he said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(To be continued)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ps:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Hmm... In this way, some adults said that the recent chapters seem to feel a bit strange. One thing said half and turned to say another thing, just like listening to a song and hearing that half was picked up. Another, but the feeling of turning back after a while - this, please readers forgive me, because the two protagonists of this volume are not as inseparable as the previous volumes, they are separated, and not short-term, they Each has its own affairs, and these things are inextricably linked with the development behind it. It cannot be ignored. Therefore, it can only be written as a double branch. It is not impossible to confess only one line in several chapters, but I always It feels like it will form a fault. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In short, I will even add more to this volume every day. When the story develops to a certain extent, adults can see it more clearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next volume of Hopkins and his son will be together again, please don't worry, I will arrange a romantic and warm reunion scene! ! ! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
