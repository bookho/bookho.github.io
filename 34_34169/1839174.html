			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone present, including Big Hopkins, is a standard foodie and a cricket. They are satisfied and delighted, and wholeheartedly devote themselves to the various cuisines. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the owner, from time to time, add more scrambled eggs, yogurt or a oyster with lemon juice to Hopkins. Others are competing to toast when Hopkins occasionally puts down the knife and fork. With a huge beer mug, the bull's blood or golden ochre wine is a bit turbid, lacking aroma but mellow, strong - local The grapes are deeply rooted in volcanic rock rich in high-iron elements. The fruits they produce are extremely high in acidity, so the wine is more firm and special. It is full of unadorned original beauty. Unruly wildness - almost inevitably associated with this, the people here, as well as another special product "Masoye" here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha is also happy to satisfy his appetite, Old Andriana, the thin old woman who is waiting for him, can see that small Hopkins has easily taken her good feelings like angelic beauty and good education. She closely watches the strange little guest and recommends his own good food to him - all of them, she Attentively pour the sweet basil sauce, the aroma of the thin tender beef slices into the sanded basin, and a small spoon, followed by a teaspoon of macaroni, remove the head and tail of the shrimp and no bigger than the palm of the hand Salmon steak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, Old Andriana has taken into account the inevitable limited appetite of Sasha (a child under ten years old), but the number eventually catches up. With the capacity, when the adult men are getting better, the children have to start to enjoy desserts, alcoholic biscuits, banana pie and ice cream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps attracted by the honey on the banana pie, an obese wasp slammed his wings and fell from the sky, and Sasha stopped the fork. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Andriana squinted at her eye, suddenly reached out and grabbed the wasp in the wrong place, her hand clenched into a fist, inside It was empty, the wasp continued to make a squeaking sound inside, and the eyes of Sasha's forgetfulness were slightly enlarged. Old Andriana smiled at him: "Dear," she said sweetly: "Wait for a while, I have to put it outside," she said as she swayed away from her original position, and Sasha’s eyes stared at her fists without hesitation until She turned a thick gorse and couldn't see it anymore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something touched his leg under the dining table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha immediately cocked his knees and squinted his eyes and looked down - he thought it was a free dog at first, but then he found out that it was a person , a child, most of the body and face are hidden under the shadow of the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"嗨." The thin voice said: "We have met again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He Grabbed Sasha's ankles, and then used this force to drill agilely and lightly from the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Celegal immediately saw him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wish you a good appetite, than Uncle Sangdi." The chocolate-colored boy said awkwardly, with his hands stretched out to caress his hair so that they are decent. One point - he got it from the black oat grass, his hair was messed up, and he could be compared with the hen's lair: "...well, I heard that you came here, than Uncle Sandy, I think I have to come over and see."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changalle licked his mouth. "You are a little piglet that smells meaty, small Bastard... Well, sit down and let the old Andriana feed you. Also, I said you can call my name directly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This can't be done, the old man will smash my ass. He said many times, either Tang or Uncle Sang," the boy said bluntly: "Of course, I prefer the one behind, too many people call you Don." I don't want to be like everyone else - too boring."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bishb." With a helplessness At the same time, a bit of a happy look, Chegal was stunned in the direction of the chocolate boy: "The old man's child, his mother is a foreigner, died very early, so whenever he goes out to work, I will entrust my child here - Old Andriana likes children, especially Besib."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can see that he was well cared for. Hopkins said that such behavior is not uncommon in Masoeri. At least on the surface, Masoye is more like a large and complex family. The leader is "father" while others are " "Children", children must respect and obey the parents, parents should also take care of the children - regardless of money or emotions, "Tang" is never jealous in this regard, if someone is out of the matter, left behind relatives, such as old parents It’s also common to order subordinates or to personally adopt unaccompanied orphans. More, trusted subordinates will enter and exit the “Tang” residence like their brothers and sons. Parents, wife and children They will also be regarded as relatives by “Tang”. Women and women go to church, gossip, and do housework together. Old people gather together to play chess or fish, and the children of “Tang” are intimately mixed with their peers— - If nothing unexpected, in the near future, a large part of the latter will inevitably take over the position of his father or uncle and become the arm and confidant of the new generation of "Tang". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for Meyare, who had grown up ten years ago, Besib is too small, and for Meyare’s son, Hopkins knows that Meyare is still not married – too Big. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who knows, maybe this is really just a simple good deed, without any motivation or intention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello, my name is Besib." The boy moved himself to a chair, sat down next to Sasha, and let go of the old wasp. Andriana brought plates and knives and forks for him - in the eyes of Sasha, the latter two are completely superfluous. The boy with the name of the great devil is obviously better at using his own ten fingers, although for him. Age and where it is - no big deal with the hand, but what makes Little Hopkins feel awkward is that every time he eats something, he will care for the same-aged guests, from chocolate. To the patties, from the baked apples to the octopus salad... I didn’t realize that Sasha Hopkins needed only a cup of tea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the education that Sasha had received in the past, it was a very rude thing to refuse the food that was sent to others, but before that... he got Considering his little stomach capacity and the boy's fingers, as far as he can see, the ten places that are directly in contact with the slightly lighter fingers of other places are - ryegrass, dirt, his feet, calves, The marble tabletop, as well as... a variety of dishes that have been smashed into hills on his plate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why don't you try it? I can swear to God, everything is fine!... Or do you want something else?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha turned his head to look at him, he wanted to know if he was deliberately tricked--in the purple-blue eyes, the boy couldn’t help but stop chewing, he It seems a bit overwhelming, and a little scared: "... can I know your name?" He said in a very small voice, his right hand repeatedly pinched a pear soaked in sugar, and the juice stayed from his hand. A small beach stain was formed on the dining table. "My name is Besib." He repeated nervously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sasha Hopkins."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sudden. Suddenly?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha was silent, he pulled the sleeves of King Hopkins and pushed the number of foods that could not be underestimated - he knew, His father must be paying attention to himself all the time - of course, he knows exactly what happened here! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry," he said, then jumped off the chair and walked away without looking back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that panicked Besib looked at the old Andriana. "Hey, what am I doing wrong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think our little guests may be a little tired," Old Andriana understood and sympathetically touched the boy's head: "He should like the library," The old woman looked up and observed Chekale. After getting a glanced look, she continued: "You can use lunch first, then take a shower, change your clothes and talk to him again. I will give it to you again." Send some mint tea."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib was quickly comforted (although it was a bit frustrating), he plunged heavily into the food, and The adults exchanged the eyes of Niu Jun, and Chegara squinted at Big Hopkins, as if he was telegraphing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The child should be with the child," Chegarer handed his own cup, and Hopkins touched him gently. "Before Sasha went to school? School... How?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Overall is not bad." Hopkins said: "Unfortunately... there is always Something will happen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He can continue here...going to school or something else," Meyare inserted and said: "...our The school wants children to like it. At the very least, children will not be insulted and beaten by their teachers. They will never have to worry about homework and exams. We are more concerned with human feelings. Of course, if you are willing, you can learn seriously. What, I make sure that every teacher has two sons, bachelor, master, doctor... everything, computer, laboratory, library - I think you will stay here for a while?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chegal took a look at his nephew, "That's it," he sincerely looked at Hope. Sri Lanka: "You saved my life, Hopkins, I will tell everyone on this island that you will be respected and protected. You and I are the same."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He reached out and patted Hopkins's shoulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This does not know whether it should be called breakfast or should be summarized The feast of lunch finally ended at noon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people, including Mayare, had to go to work. They briefly left after Hopkins apologized. Chegal and others - all strong and capable young men, their Eyes are rarely removed from Chegal, and they are armed with weapons, hidden - this can not escape Hopkins's eyes, but as Chegal said, he is the savior of Chegal He has a privilege on this island. For a long time, the ghoul does not need to show his fangs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have collected some very good cigars," Chegal said. "Go to taste, one, or two, then we can go well." Take a break."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took Hopkins’s arm and was very active – indicating that it was never a casual, disappointing invitation. - Chegal wants to make a private meeting with Hopkins. He is so eager, not even understanding. Hopkins has to retreat slightly with Sasha's meeting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they passed through the hall, they met Besib, and the boy probably slid off the table half an hour ago. At that time, he still looked very angry, now He looks so bad - he cries, his face is red (it's not easy, for a dark face), tears are like a rain on the marble mosaic floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's the matter? Besib?" Chegaler asked softly, and he seemed to be very patient and tolerant to the boy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishb shook his head desperately. "He is a boy." He sobbed and said, "It’s a boy."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can I know what happened at noon?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghoul had to press his curiosity until after dinner, when he was alone with Sasha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha. Hopkins looked up from the book with a blank expression - that is the book, standing upright and half as high as Sasha: "He wants to pursue me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He didn't realize that you are a boy?" If it was four years or three years ago, that can still be explained, then the time Sand can only be described as small and cute, but now this is ready to enter the puberty of Shasha Hopkins... His beautiful face is especially childish, but the muscles and bones have become solid, contours, body So it looks slim – he grows tall every night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
