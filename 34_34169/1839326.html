			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slight snoring of fresh air equipment and air-conditioning equipment has stopped, the whistling and snoring of the flames are faintly audible, and the wind blows from the vents Come out, with stench and heat, they can feel the lungs shaking and vomiting every time they breathe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four children returned to the starting and ending points, as opposed to the corridors they came from, a wall covered with hard metal, which originally depicted red and Golden flames, black arms, pale, hairy faces and cold-blooded animals - it is twisted by the tremors above and below, cracking, revealing the inner inside of the black hole - empty and cold, as if dug The visceral bear was empty, and the seven ugly gray pillars supported a strange object that seemed to magnify hundreds of times the watch movement. The walls and pillars were all stone, only it was bronze, mixed with a little black iron, each The gears and chains are rubbed in a sparkling crystal, and the air is filled with a strong smell of olive oil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a pile of fresh gravel on the other side. There used to be a ramp to escape, but now it has been blocked. The researchers must have left here. When the last person walked into the ramp, he controlled the doors that they thought were walls and closed them. Finally they frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the rolling sounds, they are all shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Something is flowing in the rustle, the chain is smashing, the gears of big and small are tightly snapped together, slowly rotating, and then they hear the crisp Kaka Sound, almost everyone in the world has heard it, is the joyful song sung when the key opens the door lock, slightly, slightly, slightly, the pin of different lengths is pushed to the appropriate position by the key, then slightly A turn, ok, the door opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge and heavy things are turning, just above their heads, rumbling. Dull, accompanied by Kaka (seven laps counterclockwise, seven clockwise). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come on," someone behind Sasha shouted: "I can't support it for a long time." "Marian" whispered weakly: "It hurts." It’s really amazing, come on, let’s take you up.” She was half lying in the hallway: “I really want to drink water, cool, clean, don’t let anything go – let Lila’s little wife Go to hell, we can deal with her - if you stand there again, we will die here together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib lay beside Charlie, his face was bloody, his eyes drenched in the skin piled up in a towel. The mouth and nose were still breathing openly, but could not find his teeth and tongue. The limbs were strangely stretched and flattened. Fortunately, no extra brothers and sisters had been born yet, and Sasha walked over. Touching his face, Besib's eyes slide under his palm, and he pushes it back to the eye socket with two fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can 'Billy' stick to it?" he asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Should be," said "Marian": "But the few minutes before, he was tortured enough - he must rest, to deal with that madness The woman, only me and Lulu, Lila can't."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have an idea." Sasha said: "If it works, then we don't have to Worried about that Lila."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Marian" was silent for a while, then "Lilla" was exchanged: "Talk about it." She said . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two thousand and five hundred years ago, when the land was still ruled by the ferocious and bloody polytheists, they built a huge temple dedicated to One of the most respected gods. The door of this temple can show the miracle of the mortal singer, the five-body cast - as long as the priest headed in front of the door, chanting the curse loudly, the two were cast from bronze and wrapped in gold. Inlaid with gems, the door that needs fifty people to push open will slowly open itself in a loud noise - the fooled man will finally figure out the difference after 2,500 years. A hydraulic linkage that is older than the Savior's existence, they found the hydraulic cylinders that have been preserved for more than 20 centuries and the rust-corroded, broken, but still clear-purpose connecting rods and other accessories. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After more than a thousand years after the monastery was built in the temple, its organs are more sophisticated and ingenious. It is normal for the dean to tell the leader’s basement. The entrance was below the baptismal pool, and he did not lie. When the deans and monks wanted to take out and put in their property, they would come to the baptismal hall and push the marble baptismal pool according to the established method. - Perhaps this arrangement is to avoid a monk who was tempted by the devil because of a moment of greed to quietly open the treasure house belonging to the entire monastery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trap started when they pushed the baptismal pool in the wrong order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What Sasha heard may be the sound of this subtle organ returning to its original position. Then, if someone pushes the baptismal pool in the correct order, will the door be opened? It is almost imaginable that Little Hopkins was buried. After the thieves and the predators were buried in the baptismal hall, the surviving monks came to move the stones, clean up the ruins, wait for the organs to reset, push the baptismal pool, and go out to shine. The silver and copper coins brought in the re-establishment of the baptismal hall by the craftsmen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How can you know what order is correct?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Try "Sasha said, "We still have time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only once," Lila said: "If you can't, I will take you up first, then It’s Besib, then Charlie.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie looked at them, this arrangement is very reasonable for Lila, Sasha is her male Friend, and Besib is a close friend of her boyfriend. She and Charlie did not know each other two days ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha did not argue with Lila, Dr. Hopkins would never have implanted Besib. The seed of the object. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you do this?" Lila looked up at the metal levers and connecting rods. "Where to pull? Or?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We can take a trick," Sasha said. "We don't need to insert the key into the keyhole. We just need to press those pins." He said, look up. Those stacks of compasses, "Can you still float up?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you hold my waist? Give me some strength, pay attention Don't be too much.” Lila said, waiting for Sasha to hold her waist, her feet gently stepping on the ground and floating. Her shoes and trousers are still the same, and Sasha tries to control herself not to think about what it is like. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you touch those pins?" Sasha instructed the direction of the groping: "It may also be a round bead."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I touched the pin," Lila said, her body moving in the air, and Sasha followed her: "A circle of pins, the baptismal pool is the key, it is turning Will put those pins down. The question is, do you really know the correct order?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know," Sasha said. "But it's better than not."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;clockwise seven laps, seven times counterclockwise, the dean said, Also, he said in the church, "Seventy seven," you know, when you understand, from the order to rebuild Jerusalem, until there is a anointed king, there will be seven seven and sixty-seven seven. In the midst of a difficult time, the city of Jerusalem will be rebuilt in the same street.”” He said, “After sixty-two seven, the anointed one (that is, there will be) will be cut off, nothing. There must be a king. The people will come to destroy the city and the sanctuary, and will eventually be washed away like a flood. There will be battles, and in the end, the desolate things have already been settled. Within one seven, he will strengthen the covenant with many people.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One and a half, he will make sacrifices and sacrifices cease. The destruction of abominable (or desolation) is like flying, and there is anger at it. Wreck the body (or pour in the desolate land) until the end of the decision - seventy seven."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp What kind of numbers would it be? Seven, six, ten, two, seven, one, seven... How many combinations can they list? They can only try once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"clockwise seven, counterclockwise ten, clockwise seven."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the team knows that he is going to die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was amazed that he could hold on for so long, he couldn’t feel the injured leg, only the pain in the eye socket and the cheeks remained. Some traces left, during this hour, he continued to bleed, he could feel his body has become dry and empty, like a caterpillar sucked by a spider, but he still insisted The leader dragged it out and got into the narrow place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The finely broken stones fell through the cracks of the bronze branches, causing new wounds and bruises on him. The head did not care about this, he worried Those big stones, they are trying to destroy this temporary small shelter without stopping, the metal lights are sagged and erected, leaving him room for getting smaller and smaller. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun can still shine without any hindrance, but the head of the group has only a bunch of dark things, like the mucus of the monster, and it is invisible. The devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
