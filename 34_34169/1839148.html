			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is grayish white, like a movie screen before the opening, a whole screen, from this side to the other side, motionless, no change, see The end of the curtain is sunk in the gray sea, the sea is as quiet as the sky, the quality of the air seems to reach a new height today, human eyes can't see them, but can feel the omnipresent The pressure - tiny, uncapable air molecules crush the waves and steam, the sea water becomes sticky, and each time it takes more effort and longer time; the milky white bubbles are in the gap between the sea water Drilled out, like the foam on the fermented tea, tumbling and expanding and expanding, eventually accumulating into a continuous low peak, forming in the first second, and then crashing in a second, the countless clam-colored traces on the surface Extending into slender scorpions and iron ropes, the gray-blue sea that has been banned has lost its vitality and color. There are no birds or dolphins on the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take the line of sight back, the dark brown squid breeding pool outside the glass window, the square pool, surrounded by emerald water floating lotus, in children's consciousness The oxygen machine, which resembles a mechanical monster, stops at the side of the pond. Every three hours, they automatically work, pumping oxygen into the vast fish pond in a low-pitched sound. The small head of the squid, the small tail and the body appear on the water. They are clustered under a huge wooden shed. Numerous slippery strips are entangled, and the mouth full of tiny teeth stretches into the air. It's a scene that will make a lot of people creepy, but in fact, they are just praying for food. At this time of the day, workers will drop meat, pig spleen or fresh fish in the shed – from the bottom of the shed. The protruding dark green fine grid hangs under the water but a few centimeters away, the meat pieces fall on the net, and the squid will drag the feed out of the gap of the net to swallow it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The squid never eats food that falls into the water, nor does it like to eat in too bright places. They also have high requirements for water quality. Each pool requires injection and drainage systems to be separated, and the injection and drainage water sources of the entire market must be strictly separated. Otherwise, it will cause self-contamination due to the death of sputum and a large number of microcystis, leading to serious death of squid; they are also extremely disgusted with high temperatures, and the overheated pool will cause the carp to fester; in addition, there are various diseases - Nematodes, red dots, openings, Vibrio... Workers have to wait for these delicate long strips of fish – from a finger-length glass fry to an 18-inch adult fish, it takes five years. But as long as there is such a negligence - everything is finished. Sasha thought, he was a little tired, perhaps because the room was almost sealed, and the oxygen supplement couldn't keep up with the consumption - although not dead, it was enough to make most children sleepy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This room is housed by a nursing worker. Four people, all of whom are Chinese, are practical, calm, and ignorant. They are about 50 years old. Young people can't stand the loneliness and cumbersomeness of the farm; There is a simple and rough iron frame bed, there is a small bathroom, but there is no TV, only a few Chinese magazines, one of which is a beautiful oriental woman on the cover, she is holding a white rabbit, the background is one The round moon, the abstract clouds under the feet, and two square characters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mid-Autumn Festival." Sasha said that the relevant memory in the Palace of Memory is still very fresh. This painting reminds him of Kemira that day, and Her sisters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, there is nothing worth mentioning in this room. The bed has blankets and pillows, which are soft, but they are here. Everything has a common point, it's all wet, and it has a strong fishy smell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The children have already taken care of too much, they are forced to stay here, hot and stuffy, there are still a few screams, crying It takes a lot of effort, especially when most of them are only around ten years old. Not long after entering the room, they climbed onto the bed and fell asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only three children can barely stay awake, Sasha, little fat Avery (he only cursed a few words when he was just thrown in) And Marian, her performance is better than other children (except for Sasha), she did not cry, did not resist, barely talked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This reinforced concrete building has been around for nearly a decade, and hurricanes, waves, and heavy rains are all dead rivals - although it looks pretty good now, Some details have inevitably come out of the scorpion, such as the crack between the deformed window frame and the wall - the workers use white cement and silica gel to solve this small problem, saving the winter cold from the gaps of large and small Poke the knife on the back of the workers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha’s neck is hung with a hard-metal cross that fits the child’s hand, and he uses it to scrape between the window frame and the wall. Filling, this work is not easy, but fortunately Sasha has inherited enough patience and strength from his father, fresh air has come in, although the taste is absolutely not related to the fresh and pleasant, but at least there is enough Oxygen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avery’s little fat man was frightened to watch the huge pools and the more violent residents of hunger: “Will they throw us in? Inside?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The squid does not eat people," Marian said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha shrugged his shoulders: "I don't know if the squid will eat people, but I have seen it in a book, and Octavian is in When a subordinate's family was a guest, a slave accidentally broke the precious crystal glass, and the owner threw him into the pool to feed the carp."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marian Immediately grasped Sasha's arm, the little fat Avery trembled, he twisted his head, and the rounded face rose red. "I want to go to the bathroom." He muttered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then go," Sasha said slowly. "Reassure, there will be no squid suddenly coming out of the toilet and biting on your ass." In the last bit, they are more loving than you think."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little fat man has widened his eyes with fear, and Sasha just cast a gentle Smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He certainly can’t invite a girl to accompany him to the toilet, and the enemy is even worse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened later?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The squid? Do they really eat that slave?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha blinks, "There is no record in the book." "He said honestly: "This thing was recorded because the slave once pleaded with Octavian, and Octavian did indeed ask him for his behalf."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He escaped the punishment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," Sasha said: "The owner refused Octavian, the slave was still lost. Into the carp pond, it became a feed for squid."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...they won’t do that, are they?" A weak hypothesis, maybe Even its owner would not believe: "We are children." Marian stirred his fingers: "I really regret, Sasha, I should not come here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "That's right," Sasha touched Touching her hair, the little girl has a black curly hair and is very beautiful: "A happy and short trip - if it can end yesterday."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This island camp was proposed by Mrs. Boro, with only ten places - she was supported by Mr. Kason, he was in ten I bought a small island two years ago, where I opened a nursing farm. Now I am managed by his daughter Kemira. Because of the ownership relationship, there are no miscellaneous people on the island, only a few trustworthy workers. Beasts, no cliffs, no sloping reefs, or hidden streams and whirlpools - the children of St. Thomas School can stay there safely for a whole day, under the supervision and care of workers and teachers. Swimming, fishing or picking seaweed, you can also visit the pond, catch and taste the squid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty Boluo’s carefully selected children (who must have good grades, noble character, and manners) boarded the island yesterday morning, as Mrs. Boro As expected, they have spent eight hours of fulfillment and satisfaction. Although they have not been able to embark on the mainland, they have not been able to compete with the English words of a graduating class, but they are not even better than a toddler. Kemira. And Streif, he may not really know how to properly raise a squid, but he has a wealth of knowledge, agile skills and a strong body, he can almost answer every question of the children and do everything thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the evening, Mr. Kay is on time to arrive at the island, accompanied by reporters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is part of the deal, and Kaisheng provides a safe and comfortable camping ground to St. Thomas Primary School, and perhaps some of the expenses – St. Thomas Primary School is responsible for The Chinese parliamentarian’s head has a gentle and generous aura behind it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reporters get news and rewards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A successful camping event can add a lot to Mrs. Boro’s work record. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Children get new experiences, feelings, nutrition – both spiritual and physical satisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mob caught the opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They almost followed the reporter into the room, wearing a rough gray denim, with a mask and a hood, holding a gun, they When you enter the door, you open the insurance and order everyone, including the child, to raise your hands and stand up to the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They don't want to talk to anyone, whether they are crying, crying, cursing, or scolding. The communication tools and things that may become weapons are confiscated. The defenders are forcibly divided into three parts, and the children are kept in the workers' room. It was male and female, and Mrs. Boro and Kemira were locked into the storeroom, while Kaisheng, Telif and the workers were locked into the cellar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stacle’s nose is filled with the smell of the squid – the cellar is filled with squid that has been packed and waiting to be transported, in order to keep them Quiet, so as to avoid unnecessary losses in the transportation, in addition to the water there is a lot of ice in the box - the gray-grey squid floats between the water and the broken ice, even the tail is too lazy to move, the box and the box row The cloth is very close, except for the aisle that enters the door, there is no place for people to stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the door is closed, the temperature drop is more obvious, and you can feel it without looking at the thermometer on the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Straef touched the wall lightly, icy and timid: "It’s an unexpected start." He yelled, the voice was no worse than the workers’ breath. Bigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are they..." A worker stuttered (he unconsciously used his native language) and asked, he looked at Kaisheng The country, the eyes are motionless, as if the answer is in the pocket of his boss, just touch it and you can read it out, "What do they want?... Robbery?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Steeloff dropped his hands, Anthony Hopkins has extraordinary language skills, and many years ago, his medieval Italian and Latin easily made Florence's art committee members dumped in his At the foot, he also speaks French, German, Russian, and Spanish. He is said to have studied Arabic for more than three hundred years and the most conservative Icelandic language (Old Norwegian). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also knows Chinese, simply speaks and writes, but no one here knows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The squid entering the fishing season can be sold for 10 yuan per pound, and at least 10 tons of squid in this oyster farm, a medium-sized fishing boat can take them all Stealing. In the past, workers who had been raised in the market were sneaked up and sneaked away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kai Shengguo was silent for a while: "I am sorry," he turned to Streiff: "I didn't expect to encounter this kind of thing." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't understand a bit," Strath said in a chilling naive attitude: "What do you think is happening here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Kaishengguo obviously hesitated. "Maybe it is robbery. The recent price of squid has risen again... there is at least 200,000 yuan here." He paused, his lips moved quickly, this time It is Chinese. "I hope so." He said: "breaking money and avoiding disasters."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, if it’s just a simple robbery, the thieves only want salmon. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if that’s really the case, they don’t have to be so fine – it’s all right to tie all the people together in the house. Even if someone can get rid of the alarm, it will be a matter of hours. Who can accurately find a medium-sized fishing boat without any distinctive features in the vast sea? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I feel like a pirate," said Streif. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the original work in the house, the workers did not wear the bulging down jacket, only one or two poor quality sweaters, over time Elapsed, the calorie consumed by the food in the evening was exhausted. They had to gently rub their feet, rub their hands, and put the bodies together to dispel the cold. Streif’s words made them shake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People who work at sea and on the beach cannot have heard of pirates. They hold transport ships, fishing boats, tankers and the above staff, without paying ransom, They will wreck on the ship. The worst thing is that the pirates will mark everyone with the price. The parents of the children will give money. Of course, the Kay Kwok and his daughter will be safe and sound, even if they work at home. The ransom that is almost astronomical to them is not available for a lifetime. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They will be killed, perhaps cruelly murdered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's impossible, pirates won't commit crimes here, it's too dangerous for them." Kaishengguo said: "The country will not let them go." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Street has shrugged his shoulders. "Who knows? Somalia has not been so mixed recently."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
