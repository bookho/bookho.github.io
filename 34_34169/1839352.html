			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not long before Besib left, Sasha came out of his room, and he took his pen, notebook, and homework. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am going to the library." Sasha said, "Go with you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No," Beppe said. "I don't understand what you are talking about."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bep is a child who loves to read on Poseidon Island. He was also laughed at by other children. Chegal. Bisandi alone chose him to come to Grande to borrow and run errands, also because he was the only child who had the possibility to pass the Grand Test in addition to Sasha and Besib. - He has been working hard since he arrived at Grande, and now he is able to keep up with the progress of the regular class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes...the ordinary class, not the "gifted class", he and Sasha went to the library once, but found themselves in their group discussions. It's only hard to understand less than one-tenth of them - these mixed-balls have begun to study some of the bridge courses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you prepare for your dinner?" Beppe said: "Do I need to bring you a copy?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bring three pure beef to Besib." Sasha said, "Give me a tuna sandwich."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Sha’s students in the same group met him in a familiar cubicle. They were all smart people, but not scholarships. The most important thing is that their parents are not in conflict with the Douglas family. The Carson family has a relationship, or simply nothing to do with both - when they saw Little Hopkins, they raised their hands happily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha and Besib are still in the regular class, these children do not reveal a hint of want to even know them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grand has an elementary school. Every child is a classmate from the age of five or six. They are knowledgeable and familiar with each other. Than Sangdi and Hopkins, that is, two strangers, unknown origins, and are incompatible with any part of Grande, but they have to be inserted into their best class and may have to steal one or two key positions. Barbarians - they are not interested in taking care of this guy - which is why, when the school started in the ninth grade, Boa Douglas made no reason to find two new children. But most people (including teachers) are still neutral. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neutral, not to Douglas, or because they also hate Boa and...the two are really beautiful children. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first impressions of Sasha and Besib have changed are teachers, then students - they are just big kids after all. Some people insisted that the end of the first semester of the tenth grade would barely admit that the two outsiders were not weaker or even stronger than themselves and their friends - once the time, territory, and identity were built, the barriers were broken. You will find that Grande's pride is still very gentle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Children who like sports are willing to contact with Besib, and children who like to read and solve problems are the first to approach Sasha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today is the first day, the team members selected a collection of Dickinson’s poems, taking turns reading, commenting on each other, after two hours of relaxing and relaxing, They walked out of the library. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beip is waiting outside for Sasha, he carries a small book with him. The children of Poseidon Island are quite lacking in reading. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Would you like to see Lila?" Beppe said, he brought two sandwiches to Sasha, made a square, and himself. Tomato meatballs macaroni, they dine together on the lawn outside the library. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened to her?" Sasha asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey." Beep said: "It is said that she was injured, just before you went to Orlosa - but now she seems to be fine. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will go see her," Sasha said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Carson had a big fight with his father, Wolf The rich and dirty vocabulary of Mr. Douglas’s old man was shocking. Mrs. Carson was neither able nor willing to speak out to him, but her attitude was as hard and cold as the iron-clad stone. Those adjectives that are unbearable, empty and boring. Every word spoken by the old gentleman, every word refuted one by one, she does not think that her own feelings with Kaide Carson are a mistake, nor do they think that they are hopeless, and do not think that Kaide. Xun is just an insatiable, rhetoric. Speculators who are full of intrigues and tricks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So what about Chiz?" Mr. Douglas yelled angrily: "You don't want to think about Chiz?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cade is her uncle!" Mrs. Xun shouted: "He also loves Chiz!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank God!" Mr. Douglas screamed resently: "His love value five "Millions!" He waved his arm and his face turned red: "Do you know why Chez Carson was kidnapped? She was supposed to return to the Western Continent early that day, what delayed her footsteps, that is The shameless mobs, they sent a young man to pay attention to this little girl who was not deeply involved. I thought of sending her into hell! I threatened her, threatened her, gave her an injection, and let her look at herself. Dad was cut off his leg and was broken by a particle bomb. Why? Tell me, dear, why? Chiz is just a little girl, she is neither a prosecutor nor a doctor. What can a dog shit with her? - Let me tell you..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I don't believe it!" Mrs. Carson replied coldly: "He doesn't have to do that!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I haven't said that name yet," the old Mr. Douglas suddenly calmed down and said with a bitter tone that he could only hear in the mouth of a person who had never tasted honey and sugar. "He certainly has this need." - He took my granddaughter to extort me. If I don't take out a 6 percent stake from John Carson, he will inform the criminals and kill Chiz Carson. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He closed his mouth and stared at his daughter with a pitiful attitude and a contemptuous look at the king: "This is Kaide Carson." Why didn't he take you to threaten me? My dear daughter, don't imagine it is too good, not because he loves you - he knows that I have already given up on you, you are too stupid, stubborn, innocent like The transparent popsicle is like a spoonful of melted cream, and the fragile is like a pack of broken sugar, such as It’s that you and John Carson are missing, I can’t even have one.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow Douglas finished what he wanted to say – or He said that he had finished the knife in his daughter's heart and took the coat, the cane and the hat sent by the butler and strode out of the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does Mrs. Carson really know nothing about Kade Carson’s behavior? When she said this, even she would laugh. She knew that her husband’s disappearance and murder had nothing to do with his brother. Kaide Carson had also apologized to her. ... that was just an accident, she believed, but what if her father said it was true? She is not as stupid as her father has scolded. It is possible for Kaide Carson to do this—the father doesn't like her. She has been sick and sick since she was young, she is weak, and her mind is full of colorful blistering illusions... ...but he couldn't give birth to a second child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Douglas despised the idiots who donated a large sum of money to the charity to support the “lazy guys who are doing nothing”. He thinks they are all hypocrites who are notorious, and he is even more reluctant to deliver the big net worth to the country or a bloodless one. The hands of the person in the relationship - Chiz is his last hope - Chiz is a smart and healthy child. Although he is a girl, he is willing to have such an heir. Maybe he can still see the son of Chiz, he can Let the boy crown Douglas's last name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun is shining, the swan swims up the green lake, and Mrs. Carson sits down with her head down, no one dares to disturb her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the unobtrusive corner, Chiz Carson, who has not seen the entire war, sneaked up the stairs, since leaving Orlosa, her body is even worse, part of it needs to be blamed on those little white powder, and more because of her mother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She returned to the room, the nurse who had been waiting there gave her a shot of sedative - the doctor gave her a new drug, ten minutes later, The sedatives worked, and Chiz’s heartbeat suddenly dropped to only twenty per minute. The nurse immediately gave her oxygen quickly and quietly, and she slept painfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Chez Carson woke up, the doctor was looking at a book by her bed, and Chiz looked at it for a long time before she recognized it. It was a love written by Sparks. She smiled and made a strange noise in the nose of the oxygen tube. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Are you awake?” The doctor helped her unplug the oxygen tube: “How do you feel, little princess?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not bad," Chiz can only make his smile not too bitter and bleak: "The new medicine you recommend is quite useful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “The side effects are very big and many,” the doctor said. “But it has a miraculous effect.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a kind person, Chiz thinks, the doctor knows very well, she Once again, I skipped the dance with the white devil's face, but he didn't say anything, didn't tell his mother, didn't tell his grandfather, and commented on other people, which was very bad for him - Chiz. Carson quietly wrote an e-mail, which was sent regularly. It took three months as the deadline. In three months, if she had any accident, the video mail that admitted that she had repeated the same mistakes should be able to keep the doctor. Reputation and license. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
