			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, Mr. Xeneke invited Sasha Hopkins and several other children to make a short but pleasant little with him. For small travel, he is an old optimist, teaching ninth grade chamber music and rehearsal skills, and has recently been fascinated by the little Hopkins plucked piano. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, not what you thought," the old man with white-browed and beard-like white hair made a mysterious saying: "Not just grass, shrubs, and fruit trees. We will go deep into Douglas's private territory," he said. "My special requirements and your special rewards, my children, such opportunities are not common."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sasha Hopkins raised his eyebrows slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are still those who receive them, four children, all of them except Hopkins, some of whom have been allowed to stay in the grass and bushes. (Like the last swimming team), and some just watched one or two eyes from afar, they were nervous and excited, and they whispered like a bird resting on the branch. It doesn't stop. The woods are dark and cool. In some places, the branches and leaves are dense and even windy. In mid-May, eucalyptus, eucalyptus, sea paulownia, hedgehog, and hawthorn all have their own flowers. In the chromophores, there are more vivid and deep color patches, which are roses, safflower clematis, convolvulus, wisteria and wild grapes and other climbing and parasitic plants, which grow more momentum than trees and shrubs. To be more prosperous, each branch is almost wrapped in one or the other tentacles, and some even put their own roots into the gap of the trunk, and then stretch the arms and body on the head of the host, they occupy the same There is so much space that the fluffy shades that seem to be so small are only a few small ones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas’s private territory is in fact the greenhouse with a semi-circular dome. It radiates a thick, soft glow in the last sunshine of the day, reminding Sasha Hopkins of the pure white marble, a giant mausoleum with glass and agate (referred to as Taj Mahal) Erling). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not clear that the greenhouse is because its room temperature is almost the same as the external temperature. The fresh and refreshing wind blows from the narrow vents along the wooden walkway from the other side to the end. The green and dark green branches creak and the flowers are gently shaken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because the plants here are more or less toxic or addictive... there are extremely tight protections around... so don't rely on Too close or touch," Dr. Douglas said, he took the lead in demonstrating a bunch of poisonous hairs - his pale fingers swiftly past the top of the yellow-colored corolla, and the teachers and students immediately listened. To the subtle snoring, the blue current of the wire thickness bursts brightly in the air. "It is very sensitive by infrared and temperature control." He showed his hand to the children, and there was a bright red mark on it. : "Pain. In addition, it will be paralyzed for a long time, and don't even think of a leaf and a flower in the bush," he added with a slight sigh: "They are empty. It is definitely not worth the loss."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A girl in front of Sasha shrank his fingers in awe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a paradise for toxic and addictive vegetation - almost all kinds of colorful poppies; funnel-shaped white corolla The gyro, the leaves are fragrant, people call them "the horn of the angel"; the belladonna of the lavender bell-shaped flower, it is said that the witches use its juice to enlarge the pupil to make men mistakenly think she has already meant for him. Disgusting; stinky hairy fairy; often used as a poisoned celery for celery; crocheted on the croton tree, yellow vine; green worms at their feet, frog, purplish peony, aconite , hyacinth, fritillary... and coca like a small tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you are still interested." Dr. Douglas said at a volume that only two people could hear: "I am very willing to personally make a cup for you." Eighty-six years of recipe for coca."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha, who is looking at the little tree, looked up at him and wondered when they were behind the crowd. Feet, Dr. Douglas stood close to him. "The coca in 1886 can't hurt me, but it's not necessarily for you." Addictive drugs are already deeply rooted in 21 A cancer in the human body and spirit of the century. But mankind has never given up the efforts to uproot it. It is especially important for the children of the future. Even though it has been repeatedly banned, the blow has never been repeated once. If Dr. Douglas did this, all his qualifications would be cancelled and he would be prosecuted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, the premise is that he really "has been caught." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just want to express my apologies," Dr. Douglas said earnestly. "For Boa, my nephew. As far as I know, he is very rude to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha walked two or three indifferently Step, he suddenly raised a question that had nothing to do with the dialogue of Fangcai: "Can you tell me the meaning of this line? Mr. Douglas?" He pointed his toes with a bronze medal marking the name of the plant, below the name of the plant. Inscribed with three curved patterns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah," Dr. Douglas said: "That is part of the Douglas family emblem, representing the water wave." His performance is both calm and natural, as if they had This issue has been discussed for half an hour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is also this sign on the threshold of the library."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, because the greenhouse and the library were built by the Douglas family," Dr. Douglas revealed. The weird smile that makes people want to smother him: "They have to leave some marks everywhere - just like the male animal circle. If something stepped in, their nerves would be tight. Get up, scream, keep on going, don’t even sleep like that.” He seems to have inadvertently pointed to the sky covered by glass: “The Carson family donated a machine vision and sensor joint. The lab, and Grande accepted, my brother was furious." He said this sentence, always watching Hopkins' eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright purple-blue eyes are more magical in dark places, sparkling with calmness and firmness that are completely out of proportion to the age of the owner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The person standing behind you is Kaide Carson," Dr. Douglas said in a lighter voice than before. "But you are not a Carson." He reached out and grabbed a moth that danced between the two: "So, I think I still have to say sorry, what I did for Boa, and... those who didn't do it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said, throwing away the crumpled moth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins ended the tour early and returned to the dormitory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dormitory is empty, Sasha goes to the football field, there is no one, he called the mobile phone of Besib, and no one answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha found their instructor, he told Sasha, who was somewhat anxious, and Besib. Bissau became the official player of the football team today. So the whole team went to celebrate for him. The coach had already asked him and the grade instructor for this time: "Do not worry, nothing, wait patiently," he patted Sasha's head: "When he comes back, don't forget to say congratulations."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha said thank you, turned and walked back to the dormitory. He absentmindedly drank a cup of peach yoghurt that he usually hated, sitting in the small hall - the hour hand moved a little, Avery came back, only he was alone, his face was not good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about Besib?" asked Sasha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He still has something to do." Avery slipped his head and smiled reluctantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha looked at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avery walked slowly and sat across from him, moving his fingers. "Don't be so nervous, Hopkins," he said with a sigh. "It's just a welcome ceremony. Every newcomer has to do this." He looked at the clock. "It will end at ten o'clock. They will release him. I also experienced it last year. Nothing terrible." , just an empty room."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha stood up: "Where?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Please don't..." Avery pleaded: "You can't destroy this ritual. It's not good, Bessib will be unlucky, I will, I can't sell the whole team."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tell me where he is," Sasha said. "I just have to decide where Beib is, I don't talk to him, don't let him out, just take a look, no one will know that I am "Where has it happened."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't think that is a good idea..." Avery was downcast: "Sasha, you will let me and Besib this In the past two years, I became a joke of the whole school."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't think it would be too much to mind," Sasha said. "It doesn't matter, I can. Go by yourself." He has a way, an empty room, huh? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, no," Avery hurriedly stood up. "I will take you there, but God will testify, you must be careful." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called welcome ceremony was arranged in a dilapidated storage room with no windows, only one light, which was assigned to football The team used it and was filled with protective gear and equipment that the team members could use but was abandoned. The dust piled up on it day after day, and the wild cat pulled inside. In this month, it was hot and smelly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the schools of the Western Confederation, such mischief against new members has spread throughout every club and sports team - new members are forced to accept old members Various tests, from insults, beatings, forced alcoholism, to drug abuse, etc., it seems that the football team's trials can only be considered a relatively minor type. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
