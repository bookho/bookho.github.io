			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Variations entered the Tokata style, quiet and gentle tone, Dr. Hopkins slowed down, he walked into memory and thinking, Like walking barefoot into the sea water on the embankment of the stone... The obvious slender fingers of his joints are even more powerful on the keys than a falling feather. In the end, he is simply touching them, just like stroking him. The son's shoulders and backs - he seems to have something to worry about - Sasha thought, he lowered his head slightly, Hopkins cocked his fingertips, combing his hair blown by the sea breeze, like a seabird as a chick Caring feathers is as patient and careful. Sasha's hair is soft and thick, the surface is dry, but there is still a cold tide inside. Hopkins raised his little finger and rubbed his elastic back, which was wet and cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Andriana often complains: boys will never remember or would like to blow dry with a hair dryer, but use a towel to dry their hair, they would rather have a head The sea food dumplings that have just been picked up from the water run around, the water drops are everywhere, wet and crumpled pillows and sheets, only when they are most forced (such as standing in front of a mother holding a rolling pin or My sister will lick my mouth and reluctantly pick up whatever I want to scream on my head. Before I come to Poseidon Island, I will remember to bring my towel to my dad, let my father go slowly, carefully Drying his hair, yes, this is a long time ago...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, Sasha," Dr. Hopkins Thoughts said: "Really, you make your father a little sad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They stopped the action in unison, the piano had no reverberation, and immediately fell into the surroundings. Silence, Sasha turned his head and severely twisted two eyebrows, but he didn't have time. What, Hopkins gently grabbed his shoulders, urging him to stand up and go back to the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha sat on a linen-covered three-legged stool, and Hopkins thoroughly dried his hair - using a hair dryer, sizzling Looking at the mirror, his hair was blown very fluffy and looked like a tumbleweed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before going to sleep," Hopkins said: "Do you want something to eat?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;It must be said that Chegal is an individual and careful person. In the new mansion, he not only left the two spacious and bright suites of Hopkins and his son, but also managed to add a delicate and functional function nearby. A full-fledged old-fashioned kitchen – Hopkins, both a foodie and a good cook, is very happy with this. He hasn't eaten dinner yet. Sasha went to Old Andriana with Besib to get a big meat pie and noodles before coming up, but as we know, for a thirteen year old. For the boy, it’s never too much to eat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins stood in the small kitchen, the kitchen was full, the chopper was inserted in the knife holder, and each one flashed like an ice. Three sizes of frying pans hang up on the wall. On the top, like three black secluded caves, one side of the table next to the wall, made of old oak, the surface is smooth like a piece of fat, a thick chopping board with a fist, a blender, All kinds of spoons, funnels, knives and forks were steadily steadily placed in a sturdy chunky jar, white dishes arranged in order on the walls of the wall, and the walls opposite them were leaning against each other. A huge old-fashioned refrigerator with rounded corners and a large resistor on top, stocked with rich ingredients. In addition to the general kitchen, there is an aquarium with a capacity of about 300 liters, which is the same as other aquariums. There are water outlets, pumps, lamps, calcium reactors, protein demister and automatic feeding. There are no such things as corals, sea fish or other strange things in the tube. Under the influence of the swaying water, some creatures reflected by the gloomy lights are slowly crawling on the gray sea sand. Upper - two greenstone lobsters, one about a pound and a half, and the other treaty is about two pounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s just a Hopkins dinner alone, he’ll probably pick which one is smaller, but now he’s son...he and The lobster looked at it for a while and finally moved away from sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bread, tomato, cucumber, onion and lettuce, respectively, diced diced, mixed with olive oil, grape vinegar and mix well; pig ridge cut strips loose, Sliced ​​ham wrapped with garlic and celery fried, then simmered with white wine and chicken soup, the side dish is small pork sausage with mashed potatoes; followed by white fish, shrimp, crab cooked seafood soup, inside Add saffron soaked in bay leaf, white wine and salt water. The dessert is a sweet pancake made of egg yolk and thick cream. It is very strong. It can stir up the hot air when it is poured on the plate. The maple syrup is used to draw a small square shape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These dishes are delicious, they are quick to make, and most importantly, they are more suitable for the taste of a developmental boy than lobsters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha was very happy. He swallowed a large piece of meat pie and a plate of spaghetti with a piece of cheese an hour ago. Now I feel that what I have eaten before has become a bubble. His stomach is empty and needs to be filled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Hopkins ate very little, although he was the one who didn’t have dinner, but he preferred to use his eyes instead of his mouth to chew those real Something that makes him feel full - his child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Hopkins once described his philosophy to his wife (when she was a federal agent, Katherine, not Katherine Hopkins). This idea stems from Hawking’s reversal of the universe. : The universe will stop expanding, re-shrink, the aggregation will be reversed, the time will flow backwards, the broken glass will be restored to its original state, and the younger sister Sasha who was killed by the fleeing soldiers at the age of six can also get a chance to resurrect - he Convinced of this, Catherine supported this idea and thus introduced something new – she thought that Anthony Hopkins also had a beautiful place, and the same place as Sasha, Sasha could be resurrected. Resurrected on her, but she must also be part of Hopkins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her words were confirmed in the following years like the loud noise of the apostles, Sasha was born, he has the expectations of Hopkins Everything, Sasha is reborn in his perfection, but at some point, Hopkins can still see the parts related to Anthony and Catherine, and even find the father of Kaiserlin and his grandmother. trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the age of six, Hopkins was deeply immersed in unimaginable panic because the former Sasha died at the age of six. He often stayed up all night, staring at Sasha until the day came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha did not die, he grew up healthily, and Hopkins was delighted and inevitably a little scared, the child almost changed day after day, From sound to height, from tooth to testicle/pill, what will he look like? Will there be any vicious things sneak into it to expel those parts that belong to Sasha? If so, what should he use to get them back? If, if it can't be recovered, then it exists in the body of the world. Is it the Sasha Hopkins that he expected? Fortunately, these problems have not been plagued by Anthony Hopkins for a long time. His hopes have not failed. Sasha has continued all the good habits and emotions that a Sasha can have. He is smart and beautiful. Healthy and happy, he has relatives, friends, know how to enjoy the fresh air and sunshine, blue water, green olive forest, happiness that Hopkins’s younger sister Sasha could not get. He inherited and continued. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s himself who is so tightly biting the soul of Hopkins as a viper, his reason tells him that he should do this, and his emotions are Fear of one's own behavior will bring devastating and irreversible changes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked into the memory of the palace, Katherine was still in the old place, gracefully curled up in the round cane chair, the deadly arrow Also inserted in her hair, as her movements posed, like a special shape of hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If Sasha grows up," Hopkins asked. "Would you like to teach him to use a gun?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course," Kaiser Lynn replied, a dark red blood ran down her cheeks into her chin, and then climbed her chin along her chin. She stretched her finger and wiped it away, smearing rouge. "The world is too dangerous, he must Know how to protect yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So if he kills?" Hopkins said: "Do you think Sasha will kill?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why not," Catherine repeated, straightening her legs. "I hope he will," she thought carefully for a moment: "Look," She made a trigger action: "If he can kill those deserters first, then will he not be eaten?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins thinks her words are quite reasonable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You killed," Catherine continued. "I also killed, but I never thought it was wrong - I remember that I was How to penetrate the badge and hide behind it, the stinky black heart, he is a law enforcement, but he works for the criminals, I killed him, before he fired at me - who Can you blame me, my father can't, he just pulled the gun too slow to be killed by two little punks... I saved myself and saved you, so no one can take this to set my sin, Even God can't." She smiled and made a gesture: "If I am still alive, I will teach him to shoot, and will teach him to shoot before anyone."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sasha is alive, live well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do as you want." She finally said: "Then It’s not a mistake.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Hopkins is coming back At the time, Sasha had already finished eating. He even cleaned the dishes and brushed his teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come on," Hopkins said. "Let me see your teeth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;a bit of a cold finger stuck into the mouth of Sasha, Hopkins examined each tooth very carefully, gently squeezing and shaking them, each one is very good, small molars, Large molars, incisors and sharp canines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
