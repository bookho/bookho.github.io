			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie was bitten by her while holding a dark-skinned Tenny girl on the bus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her partner immediately pulled her away and rinsed her hands with mineral water, but fortunately today Bonnie took a silver ring and the girl’s teeth were licked by it. Live, leaving a deep scalp, "Let them stay away," her partner warned. "In the past two decades, at least one hour in Tani, at least one of the Tani people was diagnosed. Infected with AIDS."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She should know that we are helping her," Bonnie said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don’t be stupid," said an experienced veteran police officer. "They are all sneaking, regardless of size, one person (he is more than a gesture) - At least 500 yuan must be taken. This money is an astronomical figure for the Nepalese. Now we forcibly send them back, and their family can no longer afford this debt. She and her brothers and sisters will Was dragged into 'chick', and her parents are likely to be killed and starved." He shook his head: "She must have hated us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Bonnie looked up and saw that the girl was lying on the police car's window and looked at her silently, her face was blank, her dark eyes were bright, it looked like a donkey, a snake or a gecko. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if the bill on children’s boxing gambling has not been officially passed and promulgated, the action of the Lafayette City Council has begun to take the lead, they are unwilling to think What to do to make up for the bad impression that he gave the people and Davis in the previous two disappearances, the first to be the gymnasium under the name of Abby, and the second is the boxer who is filled by the children. For the time being, they can't do anything for parents who are crazy about sending their children to the boxing ring, but they can search for children from Nepal and other places in the name of illegal residence and kidnapping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the children they found, the children of him were the most difficult. Unlike white-skinned children from several northern regions who can be sent to welfare homes and relief centers, none of them have legal status. Once discovered, they will hide, resist and escape. They spit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old police officer once again glanced at Bonnie’s hand: "I think you need to take a break."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Bonnie took a deep breath, she was really tired, the problem is, now is not a good time to rest, the bureau is lack of people: "Thank you," she said: "But I miss me OK."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe she can comfort herself with a sumptuous dinner? As long as she can smash the heavy stone in her stomach between the end of today's work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't borrow your house anymore."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary said restlessly, she stood under the stairs, the man stood on it, his face hidden in the shadows, he used to be a professional boxer, and Mary remembered that he had been so passionately kissed. When he was young, he was as strong as the muscles of the iron. I don't know when it started. They became full and soft, and the arms, legs, and stomach were full of meat falling down like a dough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hand on the arm of the man grasped and turned into a woolen fist: "I will add you a hundred yuan." The man said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary stepped back two steps, "No," her hand reached into the carry-on bag with a puppy calling in love, she I know this man very well. After all, they have been a neighbor for more than ten years and five years of men and women, and they almost got married. She knows that his temper is very bad and he does not mind beating women and children. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Outside," she shuddered and said, "They are looking for children."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "That doesn't matter to you," the man said impatiently. "You are just a landlord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't want to remember me," Mary said quickly. ""...you have to move quickly, with those little niggers. I can give you the rent for the remaining two months." She gave in a step back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are a ungrateful 婊 / son." The man said that his cold voice made Mary shudder in a chill. "As you say," Mary took the small pistol in the bag: "I will give you two days. When I arrive in two days, I will call the police. If you haven't rolled your mother's egg, you will be waiting for someone to do it. Butt / stock!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man looked at Mary's pace slowly back, has been out of the house, her right hand is always in that small bag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Women!" He snorted again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
