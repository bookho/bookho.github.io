			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s too early for them to be happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being able to see and be able to arrive has nothing to do with it. They continue to walk through the jungle for nearly an hour before finally getting rid of the black branches and The entanglement of the long grass, greet them is a gray-green stone. Some people say that it is much wet and slippery than the woods. The soft ground always has to go much. No, the fact is exactly the opposite of people's imagination. The gaps of the block are covered by thin vegetation, yellow and white, only finger-sized flowers swaying in the wind, low leaves are gems green, and the stems between the leaves and the leaves are densely connected to each other, like The hands that people pulled up were intertwined into a dangerous net – for those thick and clumsy boots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sharp faces of the stones standing between the grass and flowers are like the teeth of a knife or a beast. The wind and abundant precipitation in the mountains not only make them mellow. Instead, they will be polished more sharply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go slow," the head shouted: "Be careful not to fall!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I would rather go faster." A member of the Besib team complained: "I am draining the last strength of my body. In five minutes, I will be on the ground, even if the ground is cracked, the devil. I won’t move if I jump out.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extra backpack on Charlie’s body has been transferred to the head of the team, and the instructor gives another pale child. Carrying up the backpack, the two adults have two bags, one on the back and one on the back. Besib and Sasha took over the part of the team’s luggage, and more weight-bearing. It’s not a big deal for them, it’s just a bit ridiculous when you carry six small pots of boiling milk and a big iron pot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least Boa. Douglas is constantly laughing at them. On the surface, the Douglas team is in the best state, they don’t sweat frequently, they’re in the footsteps. Not to be dragged, even a little mentally awkward, a child holding the leaves in his hand. After smashing it into a group, it swallowed it directly. Well, his blood flow began to flow again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This herb, Boa’s uncle Ossian Douglas has also used it. Raw materials for herbal tea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stone cost them for half an hour, and then, the thing that surprised the first time came here, and behind the stone was a dark black asphalt floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vast asphalt floor, at its center point, is the stone gray, like a small medieval castle monastery, if there is a helicopter The person looking down from the top down, he will feel that he saw a black forest cake, the stone is like a paper tray of the cake, the asphalt floor is melted chocolate. The castle is the moldy cherry that is dotted on the cake. ,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last rays of the sun shrouded them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why are they laying asphalt floors here?" Besib asked strangely, would anyone still park here? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is said that the dean of the monastery heard the call of the Holy Spirit more than a decade ago," the instructor said. "He obeyed the will of the Lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is," Boa. Douglas said bluntly: "A decade ago, a lonely old man While sleeping in his bed, the Holy Spirit shouted at his ear, 'You have to put asphalt around your monastery!' instead of repairing the so-called road that is narrow enough to pass the record," he Then added: "Oh, I forgot, I am talking about the side of the record."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not just asphalt," the instructor said: "Return There is concrete, some people suspect that there is a problem with the foundation of the monastery."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." A member of the Besib team shouted: "There is asphalt ground to give Isn't it a good thing to walk you? Or do you still want to walk the woods, or stone?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas casts a glance at him with poisoned juice. Fiercely, people want to draw a mark of evil spirits on their chests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think the children are still a little bit hard," the instructor said to the head of the team, sighing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go ahead!" The head estimated the distance: "Just take another five minutes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Asphalt ground is really better to go, soft. When they set foot on the hard stone surface of the monastery, they almost all went back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dean of the monastery greeted them at the door, as Douglas said, he was an old man with silver hair. No hat, a black robe with a round neck, an ivory rope in the waist, and a white shirt collar turned out from the round neck of the robe. The feet are a pair of fluffs that look a bit old but definitely very soft. Low-top shoes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He first brought the Boy Scouts into the restaurant. The restaurant in the monastery is always very big, because the monks must gather together to eat, now it is not the monks who dine. At the time, the restaurant was empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two monks were carrying two white iron pots with cold honey water in their pots. Bessie took a sip and found salt in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The honey beer here is the best," the instructor said: "Unfortunately you are not yet able to legally consume alcohol."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monks entertained them to drink honey water, and brought in dried meat, cheese and bread. After they were full, some people couldn’t help but scream, "You guys." You can go to bed early," said the head. "Because tomorrow is a monk day, you will spend a whole day as a monk. This is a very rare experience, and I wish you happiness."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think he talked a little bit about the gloating glory." Besib said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are right." Sasha said, "Do you think they have a shower?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hopefully," Besib sniffed his arm: "I have been mad for three or four days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, they are not in medieval convents. The monks have bathing places, but they are very primitive - that is a small bathroom that is naturally formed, perhaps because the water flows out of the mountain wall, it is very cool, and it is only enough to accommodate one. People stand below to rinse. “Be able to cleanse the body and be able to clear your mind,” said the monk who led them here. “Even in winter, it won’t freeze or dry up.” The water they drink, the water that dries the dough, the water that washes clothes, It’s all from here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the group originally wanted to sleep in the barn with the children. Now there are only seven people in the monastery. Together with the dean, they only have a few Sheep, huge barns are empty (people nearby have the habit of raising livestock in the barn). But the abbots insisted that they sleep in the monk's room: "Since tomorrow they will sleep in the monk's room," the dean said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the instructor went to ask the children's opinions, the sleeping bag can be used in the barn, but the monk's room has only a wooden bed and a thin bedding, and the door can not be locked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, their mobile phones must be handed over to the Dean, because the monks are forbidden to use the phone and the Internet, "Please note, children," Dean and Dean Said: "I am not keeping the phone for you, but asking you to voluntarily transfer the ownership of the mobile phone to me, two nights a day. So, your mobile phone belongs to me during this time, anyone In the case of failure to obtain my consent, take the phone, it will not take back the 'own' thing, but the crime of stealing." He pointed to the restaurant cabinet, the door of the cabinet was mottled. There is no lock, not even a bolt: "Don't worry, your head and instructor will take their phone with you, and be sure to connect anytime, anywhere. If you have any need to use the phone, you can find them. I don’t think they will refuse.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“When are we going to wake up tomorrow morning?” Charlie said: “There is no alarm clock set by the phone, I am afraid I will wake up. But come."<br /><br />&nbsp;& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We get up at 3:45 every day, and the schedule is placed on your bed." The dean said: "There will be people who will wake you up."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——A monk stood in the hallway at 3:45, and accurately rang the small clock in his hand. The bell penetrated the thin one with little effort. Wooden doors and solid stone walls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Boy Scouts jumped up with their eyes closed. They slept very early yesterday, but the body clock for more than a decade was not so easy to adjust, and the room was still a black hole. They groped for their clothes and lined up in the hallway. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following one by one, they took turns to sip with salt water in an abandoned manger, rubbing their face from a bucket, followed by The monks walked into the prayer hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teach at night at four o'clock, including a hymn, hymn, and reading the Bible. How many children are standing asleep, don't know, but don't include Besib and Sasha, maybe add a Boa, when the monk recites the Bible, he repeatedly looks for an opportunity to kick a boy in front. The calf, the boy is the Besib team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha saw it, he first stared at Boa, and when Bo found that he was looking back at him, he silently read a word, "Fog "," Boa's forehead immediately reflexively pained, and he retracted his foot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
