			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is the West?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine’s eyes became a bit odd: Still alive." Although it looks like a barley hill (a rabbit with black spots). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Her ability is very special, as long as it is well maintained and expanded, it will be a very good weapon." Anthony Hopkins said, "If I am a decision maker, I will use a longer incubation period of Ebola, at least a month or more - I hope your head, I mean, the real head is intentional, not because of negligence I forgot the sorrow - even a small team that stalks and sells small packaged drugs or pimps on the street will not allow an 'outsider' to step into his or her critical position in such a short period of time, let alone' "Samel'", white and small teeth shimmering under the colorful night sky in Las Vegas: "This should be a warning - 'Samel' has recently played too big, big people Hate, hehe." He made a gesture, like driving a group of annoying flies: "Well, it seems unlikely that a net is exhausted, but let them eat a small loss, it is quite convenient." I believe that 'Samel' will not be so blatant in the future. The abilities, who knows if the next target is a viral medium?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, Catherine didn’t seem to think so much, her face The expression is really indescribable. Dr. Hopkins appreciates everything in front of him. He likes this. Catherine and his deceased wife, that is, Catherine, are more than just appearances. Their feelings are equally abundant and easy to expose. Like a lettuce that is exposed outside the pancake, it can be bitten in one mouth, crispy, and the ghoul is poised to make a cup of mojito, a syrup, rum and mint leaves. Sweet liqueur (the hidden cocktail bar has fresh mint leaves). Instead of smashing the mint leaves, he put it directly into his mouth and chewed it together with the fear, disgust and anxiety of one of the "institutional" members. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine was silent for a few minutes, accompanied by a deep breath that was intentionally placed: "Fucking, Hopkins," she said dryly: "I don't know if this is a coincidence, but the 'head' did give me instructions - a small fish that slipped through the net, he was in Las Vegas, we had to pick it up before he was discovered and escaped - But here, um. It’s different from other places. Las Vegas has its own laws and rules. Even the local bureau is not willing to have a relationship with an unfamiliar foreign organization without the permission of the local gang. ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not to mention that this organization is quite righteous." Dr. Hopkins said with sympathy: "The beast does not like the net and the trap."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Catherine took a deep breath: "We need you to help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought I had helped," Hopkins said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine’s face became very poor. They did take advantage of Hopkins, so she could stand here. Sean Battier lived in Las Vegas for nearly 50 years. He is not an idiot. He doesn’t casually put an unknown one. Outsiders are sent to their beloved little villa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't matter." Hopkins said with anger: "I don't care much about this. You are the aunt of Sasha after all, but I think, I At least you can know a little more to decide what's going on - you have to know, I don't like to do two jobs at the same time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And the job It’s also a bit of a relationship.” Catherine said: “Our clues eventually fell on Ivan Sergeyevich.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shawn Battier’s cottage is actually only nine. There is also a pure white building named Ten Heaven (Tianqiu), a small casino for VIPs to gamble privately. Here, they can not abide by the laws of Las Vegas and some people do not How comfortable is the dark rule. Of course, in contrast, it also has its own threshold, the first, the most important and the main one. You have to bring benefits to the owner of this building, very big benefits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minimum chip size here is one hundred yuan. Black inlaid with 24k pure gold thread, Wu Yiyuan's chips are milky white, also inlaid with gold thread (this is the same as the outside casino), one thousand yuan is bright red, inlaid with two gold lines, and the highest The value of the chip is up to 10,000 yuan, sterling silver material, gold-plated surface, in the hands of heavy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ivan never gambles with the first time, or those who don't understand it well," said Shane Battier. "He likes to look for those." Good luck, there is a little smart person who gambles. He doesn't even mind losing a bit. He knows how to evoke the impulse and gambling of others. He is also very good at observing. When someone retire because of too much loss. He will go back a little; he likes to wear a dress with a wide pocket. He never puts his chips in front of him. When he loses, he will lick his chest and scream, and he will be very painful. When he wins, he will cry. It’s not awkward – it gives people the illusion that he doesn’t seem to win much, although the truth is the opposite. To be honest, if he is not a person in the north, I want to make a big price and find a way to dig him up. Go to work in my casino."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is he good at? Doubles, roulette or something else?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Baccarat," Sean Battier said: "Like you." I am afraid this is the fastest to come – I mean, as a gambler, when others refuse to follow up, we can’t, as long as he is still sitting in the chair, we have to Bet with him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How much is each?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One thousand dollars." The owner of the casino showed a painful look: "But he has spent more than 100,000 yuan each."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A person who dares to take risks."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Batir shakes his head: "I don't think so," he said. "He must have a way of cheating, but we can't find it. My dear friend, I hope you. Can debunk him, if you can't, then see if you can win the money from him." He paused: "I know it's a bit difficult, but I don't force it, you can quit at any time, lose. The money belongs to me. If you win, as you said before, one tenth is for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can try," Hopkins Say: "Is he still in Las Vegas?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He lives on Mars Day," Battier sighed dullly: "I He had to provide him with free vodka and a woman, a vigorous mixed ball. He had five women at most, and I paid a full three thousand for it! But I couldn’t get back even a piece of money from him!” Waving his hands, "He clearly has two women! He can play with himself! But he just wants to go with me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you don't, He said sullenly: "I have to take a risk - I have to kill him, there is always a way. Of course," he looked at Hopkins: "My biggest hope is still on you, dear friend." I will never forget how you won the 75,000 pieces. I almost made a neighbor with the cactus."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought for a while: "But I think you still don't want to appear in front of Baccarat or Black Jack gambling in the first place. You can try roulette and eyes first. He seems to like it. The latter two, although his luck did not extend to them, but he often looks for prey in these two places, especially those who are winning, he seems to like to deal with those who are immersed in happiness and happiness. In the idiot, he will be generous and friendly, a bit clumsy and forgetful, but when you want to take advantage of him, he finds that he has been kicked into hell. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
