On the single bed not far away, Sasha slept well, he could hear her slight breathing, and There are intermittent molars. Although in any respect, Anthony is worthy of being a good doctor, especially in psychology and pediatrics (this is after the birth of Sasha), but Sasha’s little problem is not good. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony stared at the glass of lemonade for a while, determined that it would not suddenly break, before he began to read the book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Hopkins!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharp screams slammed through the whole In the room, Sasha screamed and huddled, and Anthony almost crossed the distance of nearly four meters at the end of the second word, pulling the door open and holding the face of the person, always He pressed it into the window of the hallway, and the back of the head hit the window glass, making a huge collision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mrs. White, are you looking for me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony politely asks Tao, but almost grasped the right hand of the thin woman's entire face but did not relax. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please say that my daughter is taking a nap and you have already interfered with her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;He slowly let go of Cha Lisi. White, the latter looked at the skinny big hand in horror: "Doctor, my son, he, he was shocked."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She cried softly: "I’m sorry to disturb you again and again, but there are still more than a dozen hours to the next stop, and it’s too late to find a station doctor...”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Father?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha is wearing a large woolen shawl, dragging cute fluffy slippers, standing At the door, the afternoon sun shines on her, she looks like a little angel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that she has too many things in her eyes that are unclear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will go right away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony said, but his eyes did not look Check pear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Sasha was dressed neatly with the help of Mrs. Wilson, when she went to Mrs. Chali's room, there were already many people gathered, and everyone was The sad mother expressed condolences, and then she saw her father, who was invisible in a corner that was not noticeable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Another time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Again."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony replied, then picked up Sasha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Hopkins," the train conductor chased from behind. "Thank you, thank you very much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is what I should do. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony slightly. "The child had had a horror this morning. I suggest it is better to send him to the hospital at the next stop."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We also think so But Mrs. White stubbornly believes that there will be no more problems.” The train conductor shrugged: “I will try to take a doctor to the train at the next stop.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The train conductor..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know? The child's Eyes..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"唔?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s blue, just like before the rain The sky."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony smiled at the doubting train conductor, Walked into his room and closed the door with his backhand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lovers" continues to fly...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day train arrives in Kimbley, South Africa The famous city of diamonds, Anthony has some research on diamonds, but this does not mean that he will be interested in diamonds. Sasha has not yet reached the age of interest in diamonds, so the two decided to rest on the train. Read a book or play chess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At dusk, the passengers returned to the train one after another. Compared with those who were full of rewards, Anthony and Sasha’s satisfaction seemed to be stronger. But I got a whole day of peace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The train started slowly. After half an hour, the train conductor held the silver bell and slowly swayed along the corridor to summon the passengers to the dining car. dinner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Anthony of Sasha, I met Lady Lisa White in the corridor that did not appear on the same day. She took the hand of her son, that is the The little boy with blue eyes let him walk slowly with himself. She wore a different suit from yesterday, but the texture seemed to be a little worse, her face was still pale, her eyes were full of fatigue, and the children around her looked the same. The eyes were sluggish, and the hands of the finer sticks were holding the mother’s two fingers, and the legs were ugly and trembled, and there was no difference between the old man and the old man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good evening, Mrs. White."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, it's you, Hopkins Sir, "Zha Lisi seems to find them: "Richard," she shook the child's hand: "Thank you, Mr., he saved you twice! Licha! Quickly say 'Xie~Xie~'! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The child looked up and stared blankly at Anthony and Sasha: "Thank you." He immediately bowed his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No thanks, Richard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Road, and then sideways for them to make way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He and Sashamo watched the two thin and ugly backs almost swaying toward the dining car. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha fell again when the dinner was not halfway through. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doctor with the car rushed to the scene, after repeating an Anthony’s previous work, the child’s condition slowed down, but his lips were still purple And unconscious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mrs. White, you have to send your child to the hospital right away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I... I know, I, I understand, but..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cha Lisi uncomfortably clutched the hem of the suit, "If you can, okay, I hope to continue with Licha in the future." She looked at the people in front of me: "I will take care of him." She said firmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;×××<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This column 'Rovers' is really a disaster." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the Cape Town Bureau said that there was a bit of gloating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The first is the explosion, then the two passengers are missing, ah, the two people you are looking for... and I got the report before you came. They died a passenger and were poisoned."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He brought a simple file that could no longer be simple: "This is the time. Report record. You can see it, but you can't copy it. Please ask the train conductor Bill in detail."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you very much!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack gently kicked Catherine under the table: "Don't be so sloppy, Catherine, we are not cia (US CIA external department), can get this Things are already very good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caceline bowed his head. Staring at the instant coffee in the cup, it seems that the murderer can be seen from the inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack had a single person laughing and reading the file, it was very simple, simple can only see one thing, that is, two people from a train disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have been on board to investigate, the explosion seems to be caused by a certain chemical, such as liquid butane, affected by high temperature; as for your two Friends... We once suspected that they were the prisoners of this bombing. Of course, they are still suspect now... Oh, this lady, don’t be too excited, really, don’t be too excited.”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Catherine!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack called Catherine’s name, holding her shoulder and turning her Forcibly press back to the seat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wish my strength is aggressive!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caceline's voice Very low, only Jack and her own can hear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have to remember, Catherine," Jack whispered but solemnly reminded her: "No matter what type of power you have, we are this time. The task is to track, not to hunt. All you have to do is confirm the target. Then the headquarters will send someone to solve the problem. Don't try the stupid things Martin and Maria have done, do you know?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, okay," realized that he said that he should not say it, the person in charge immediately made a retreat: "You look here slowly, I want -..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, we don't see it, thank you for your help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jakea starts from Catherine and picks up his coat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We will catch up now!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;×××<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the two arrived at the terminal station of "Lobos" in Pretoria, it was not frustrating to find that two days and two nights of short-distance travel were 12 hours ago. The passengers have already passed, and the only thing that is gratifying is that the Lobos company has taken out the passenger list. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, there is a gentleman who took his little daughter with this 'Rovos'."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The train conductor received them at the dining car. He pointed to the two names we are already familiar with: "Anthony Hopkins, Sasha Hopkins. He is a doctor." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you remember what they look like?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...well, Hopkins Mr. is about 6 feet tall, 40-45 years old, gray hair, blue eyes, high taste, courteous, his daughter, the lovely Sasha, about 6-7 years old, golden curls, purple Crystal-colored eyes, very beautiful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caceline and Jack look at each other, this Hopkins has at least three features the same as the black sacrifice, he The daughter also has the same golden hair and purple eyes as the black ritual prey. Undoubtedly, the people Martin and Maria met, or the people they found, is Anthony Hopkins. But with these, it is impossible to prove that he is related to the disappearance of these two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, can we look at the room he has lived in?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course Yes, please come with me. He lives in the No. 10 car, but I am afraid there is nothing to look at, because..." The train conductor showed a bitter smile on his face: "The waiter cleaned each room after the passenger left the car... , God, what happened to your companion!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strongly maliciously crushed to Kaiserlin, her breathing was difficult, her limbs were paralyzed, The whole person slowly slid down the wall of the corridor and could not move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Catherine, Catherine?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack crouched down and hugged Katherine, who is soft, her muscles are slightly paralyzed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No...what, Jack," Catherine struggled. "It’s the kid, he... will be shocked..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Know it, I will help you out of here first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No...Continue."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you need my help? Do you want to call the resident doctor?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The train conductor asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, thank you, she just has a break."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack looked at the door, it wasn't the No. 10 car. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is this living?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This...you should know too "I seem to be really cursed," said the poor train conductor, taking off his hat and putting it in his hand. "The passenger who lives here, Cha Lisi. White, her son, poured nitrite on us. In the afternoon tea provided, his mother was poisoned."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack suddenly trembled, his hand became colder than Kaiser. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the No. 10 compartment, Jack and Catherine got nothing, and Catherine even picked up everything and sat in every place, feeling it. They are warm, cozy and sweet atmospheres, and there is no trace of thought that can be attributed to negative thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She showed a smile to Jack, is this Hopkins really not related to the disappearance of Martin and Maria? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to see the son of Cha Lisi. White."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caceline Say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rich. White was temporarily detained in a ward at the Children’s Department of the Red Cross Hospital in Pretoria, when Katherine saw him, almost Believe in your own eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God, how old is he? How can such a small child know..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He is five years old," the female doctor who accompanied me explained: "It’s just because of malnutrition and often persistent convulsions that cause stunting, and he doesn’t fully understand what he is doing. According to our understanding, he is only Simply imitating his mother's usual behavior."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cha Li Si.White?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Yes," the doctor frowned. "She often sprinkles nitrite on the biscuits for the child to eat. You have to know that the medicine will cause the child to be amazed... she seems to be happy."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why should she do this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We also want to know about this issue."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doctor seems to suddenly think of something: "Is your department called 'institution'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked Katherine and Jack, "There is a gentleman who likes Richa. If someone with an 'institution' comes, please give me this gift."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She flipped her pocket and took out a thin square gift. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Catherine took a deep breath. In one breath, before Jack blocked, he reached for it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cold is like a straight through the body of Katherine, she screams and loses consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
