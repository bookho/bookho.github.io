Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"John Wharton," said Streif. "Your father, he lived in a ward with his wife for more than two years in the hospital." Finally, his wife is dead, he is alive. Because Miss Wharton did not write down the relationship of the will, as the closest relative of the blood, he inherits and temporarily inherits (Fanta Wharton also has the right to inherit), Miss Wharton, also It is all the property of his aunt. This rich heritage is beyond everyone’s expectation. After paying nearly 50% of the estate tax, he can still get 5.6 million or so. In the future treatment, plastic surgery and life, the rest, that is, all of the three and a half million who can be used today, are used to offer a reward - rewarding his daughter, Fanta Walton - alive." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He will certainly live." Anne muttered vaguely: "He is absolutely It will only be alive.” Streif observed her, and the little girl’s face changed constantly under the bright moonlight, suspicion, sorrow, thought... and finally stayed on a pleasant and anxious mixture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know," she looked up laboriously and looked at Streiff with hope. This action is not easy, because she is still lying on the ground. The dog sat on her and threatened her with white teeth: "Where is he?" She said urgently: "Is he still living in the old place... if you are really as curious as you said - costing It’s no problem to pull the webpage down for a few seconds. You should remember his phone number, address, and maybe an instant messenger number and email address?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "What do you want?" said Streif, not answering her question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What else can you do." Annie replied with enthusiasm: "Fanta Wharton is going home, going back to her father."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Streif made a concealed expression of surprise: "Are you sure Fanta Wharton wants to do that?" He said: "Let me remind you one or two. John Wharton is very familiar with what his daughter has done in recent years - even if not, at least he knows exactly what the arson case was more than three years ago - found artificial arson in the ruins Traces and evidence, he and his wife were covered in a hospital bed in a red/naked field full of burn ointment, cursing wailing day after day for more than 700 days, until five skin grafts were received They still have to wear hats, sunglasses, masks like a bank robber or a famous movie star to not scare others and themselves, fingers shortened, legs stuck, can not sweat, Mrs. Wharton used this one night The bandage hangs on the window - you know how a person can hang himself in the window Is it the house? That means that the desire to die must exceed the instinct to survive. Because," Streif made a stroke: "She can sit up from the ground with her hands, as long as she sits up, she can Breathing... suffocation is very painful," he stared at Anne Kent. "Until death, she has at least a minute to regret... and Mr. Wharton is watching, for sixty seconds. Imagine, dear, what kind of feeling is that?" He stretched out his fingers and took turns in the silence to count the fingertips... one, two, three, four... sixty, then he lifted it up Double gray-blue eyes, "Do you really think that John Wharton will open his arms and cry to welcome Fanta Wharton back to his arms?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"John Wharton is the father of Fanta Wharton."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little girl said impatiently, her head was back on the ground, a green The little insect jumped out of the grass and jumped on her forehead, and she licked her hair angrily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"John Wharton is the father of Fanta Wharton." She repeated with confidence: "He will forgive her."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even if she made such a big mistake? To be precise," Streif said: "Is it a crime?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who, or is there any evidence to prove it?" Anne shrugged indifferently, and then showed a distressed and helpless expression: "Why do you always hold these things?" she asked doubtfully. Dao: "Fanta Wharton just wants to change his situation. This is not a sin. No matter what she does, she is better for herself. She is smart, capable and healthy. She is smart. There will be a big future, she will become a good person, maybe the first female president in the country? Who knows? I don’t think you need to pay too much attention to it - look at newspapers and TV news, almost every day. There are real crimes born in the hands of the children - Mark is flushed into the toilet for a pack The product pushed her grandmother down the stairs. Paul was found stealing money. He shot a magazine in his parents' head. Alice was at breakfast because her parents always blocked her from dating her unlisted boyfriend. Poisoning, and Allen, he was too fascinated to play games. When his mother urged him to have dinner, he gave her a knife and gave her more than ten... Well, it’s terrible to listen, especially Those boring and ridiculous motives, aren't they damn enough? But there are always people who come out to explain... their age, their experiences, their mental state, theirs, etc., those people can find them tens of thousands The reasons justify their innocence, no one can sentence them to death, they will not suffer any abuse, these really damn, wasteful resource bastards as long as they are in a warm, beautiful, adequate food, as well as the Internet, books and The teacher’s youth control center will be able to live fast and return to society in a few years.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She rolled her lips disdainfully: “They Can, Fanta Wharton But it can also be."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Straeve smiled, revealing small white teeth, as early as many years ago, he felt something or someone It’s so funny when it’s fun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The child stared at him, she thought, suddenly raised the good arm and slammed the bull terrier on her chest. The white dog made a loud noise in the dark woods, and it choked angrily. The dog next to it rushed up, but was stopped by Streif's whistle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strath's whistle didn't even use his fingers. He just tightened his cheeks and licked his lips. "What do you want?" he asked warmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just want to confirm," the child smiled appreciatively, although her face was covered with dirt and bloody scars, but look It’s still quite cuddly: “You won’t kill me, at least in this place, you won’t.” She lifted the arm that flew the bull's head and sniffed it, covered with lemon balm. Lemon flavor, no wonder those dogs will rush so quickly and madly, she thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not an institutional person, I think," Annie added slowly: "Not only, you have to hide from them, aren't you? I am dead or missing. This newsletter is on the newspaper, just like the Humboldt dying egg that was sent to the dissection table. This news is full of fun for a week. If there is another one now, Impressive news, maybe someone will notice this, then you can't hide." The little girl's smile became cunning, she looked at the house, almost all the houses here were made of iron and wood. And the bricks were built, but this old house used a large piece of stone: "Let us not hinder it," she said generously: "Tell me John Wharton's current address, I will leave immediately. No more coming back, you and Sasha Streif can continue to live here safely until you never want to live again... Come on, come and tell me," she cursed Prayingly said: "You say it, we are two "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steve moved his lips and said an address. In the next few minutes, he was like wearing a shackle in a madhouse. That doesn't move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until Anne got up with satisfaction and was about to step out of the woods, Streif raised his head slightly: "Do you still have a pain in your arm?" He said: "I think it must hurt very much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arm that was pierced by the dog’s teeth immediately violently hurts, and Annie lowered her head and found that it had stopped. Blood, she almost almost forgot, but Streif reminded her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Devil!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little girl spit at the man sitting on the stump of apple tree Spit, turned and ran into the woods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
