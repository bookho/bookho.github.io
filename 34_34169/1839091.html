To be exact, her current state is very similar to drunkenness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The love she gave to Sasha is very similar to Baileys liqueur - fresh Irish cream, pure Irish whiskey, various natural spices, chocolate Through the unique brewing technology, it not only maintains the natural freshness and silky smoothness of the cream, but also achieves the perfect blend with chocolate and alcohol - sweet and delicious, it is easy to forget that it is 17% alcohol concentration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Hopkins gave Sasha an absinthe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This wine tastes very strong and unpalatable before it is diluted. In addition to high alcohol content (traditionally higher than 68%), it is also because its main ingredient is wormwood (d) herb (ie, hium). This bitter herb contains a chemical called wormwood, which is very similar to the effective chemical component thc (tetrahydrocannabinol) in cannabis. Research by scientists in the 1960s and 1970s showed that this similarity is not accidental. Both chemicals are terpenoids. This means that "Bitter worm and thc both produce the effects of pseudopsychotic drugs by interacting with common receptors in the central nervous system", the psychological similarity between scientist jdelcastillo in his writing of absinthe and cannabis An article (Nature Magazine, January 31, 1975) said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alcohol and bitter brains are both powerful drugs that can seriously affect the nervous system. But the wonderful illusion it brought was a violent storm of "green muse" in the French literary and art circles at the end of the 19th century. Wilde, Van Gogh, Manet, and cricket have all been dumped in its dark green or turquoise skirt. under. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha likes Baileys and ice cream, or bitter wine with sugar cubes, they will make her pottery, dizzy, heartbeat, body light She can be like a demon, incarnate as a wind or a mist in the air, freely to any place, a dream, even a thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This feeling made her lazy and soft, even if Catherine was inadvertently awakened by people’s shouts, she was swaying and holding her everywhere. ... she is as silly as a real little girl, as if it were just a big game for adults to play with her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, my father is nearby, she thought without hesitation, and Miri is not far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine Spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She doesn’t understand why she stays in Ariau, before she opens Jack’s hand, she’s thinking about taking the mess My sister's children left them far away – whether they were hunters or prey. But now, she is looking around in confusion, where is this? In addition to the circular shacks and the Amazon River behind them, all the places are filled with dense fog and hot and difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A hot wind passed through Catherine’s body, and the fog spread out. With the hot air, the golden red flame tongue was as greedy as the beast of life. Crazy to rush up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine screamed, and she grabbed Sasha tightly and fell backwards, and the flames touched her fluffy long blond hair, more than before. For the bright colors to spread on the young women, she instinctively rolled on the ground until she was stopped by a rope or stick, and the impact force made her body plunging half--"Heaven Ah," she said, the pain made Catherine's brain clearer. She found herself hanging on a railing on the trestle. The whole upper body was hung outside the bridge deck, and the child in her arms was hit by this accident. She almost slipped out of her arm, but fortunately, her hands were still clutching the child's coat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha closed her eyes and could not see whether she was in a coma or fell asleep. Catherine sincerely hopes to be the former. The current situation does not allow children to spoil and even struggle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now Catherine needs to go back to the trestle, but this is not easy. The posture of the head slammed her dizziness, and made her unable to determine the surrounding situation: for example, in addition to the damn pole, is there anything that can be used for her to borrow? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She tentatively moved her feet, hoping to find a place to pick, but the toes touched only the air, and as soon as she moved, the whole body It will fall slowly - most of her body, and Sasha are in the air between the trestle and the Amazon River, there is no spider silk. She didn't even dare to shout, afraid that this shock would cause her and Sasha to fall down and feed the crocodile directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, good evening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha poked his head on Catherine’s shoulder and greeted the albino crocodile that perched on the tip of the big black crocodile’s nose, if it’s too late. She hopes that Miri will catch herself. Mori’s use of her muscles is superb. It can easily kill a skinny adult caiman and roll up a fresh raw egg. The frying pan smashed a beautiful "sun egg" instead of making it a messy mess, and the crocodile... I only hope that the distance of 8 meters will not make the rough leather arm not in her skin. There is an indelible mark on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Hopkins likes to bathe her in a copper basin in the garden. The bath water is warm in the sun, very comfortable, and with light. fragrance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......The father at that time was very soft and warm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God," Catherine found herself unable to control the momentum of the decline, She is remorseful and annoyed. She knew that this would happen. She shouldn’t be so anxious to take Sasha. If the man is really “ghoul,” Sasha may be safer at his side, no matter what. How do you say that the bad guys live for a thousand years: "God," she muttered and said, "Whether to save this child, she has never committed any sin!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "God is kind."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sound came in, and then Catherine felt a strong pull on her waist, she was lifted up, with arms Sasha in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is always willing to save those who are willing to be saved."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine barely stood firm, she did not Unsurprisingly, the savior was the priest she pointed to Jack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He still carries the wide-brimmed hat, black-gray hair in the hot air, and the light-colored eyes reflect the fire, just like a gem Or gold is hidden inside: "Follow me." He simply ordered. His voice is thick and low, and it sounds like a medieval instrument with an eccentric charm that makes people unconsciously admire their owners. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine watched as he turned and re-entered the smoke, the smoke was pushed away by him, and he gathered under his feet. She took a breath and followed closely. Go up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smoke is heavy, but not so horrible, but Catherine still tears off her silk chemise on the face of Sasha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha violently pushed the silk away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine involuntarily shuddered, she never saw so much anxiety, anger and contempt in one’s eyes, not to mention she was still child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha reached out and grabbed Catherine's burnt hair, trying to smash her face down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her strength is really great. Catherine thought, looking down at the child's meaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has nothing at her feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She screamed, the priest turned and waved the Bible in her hand, the hard-cover cover book of the horn hit her arm, she felt Paralyzed, and then severe pain, Sasha fell from her hands, the male arm with black sleeves accurately caught the child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine fell down, and in just one or two seconds she saw nothing under the priest's feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is actually floating in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as you have confidence in the Lord, you can naturally walk on the surface of the water, or on the air." The priest said that he stood calmly about three feet from the water. The place, watching the crocodile quickly approached Catherine who was desperately swimming to herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha, who was suddenly opened and caught suddenly, wanted to vomit. She had to take a deep breath and then screamed as much as she could. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this century, almost every child will be taken care of by their parents and teachers. If a stranger touches or grabs himself, he must scream loudly when possible, so that he or other adults who are willing to lend a helping hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha’s screams have the same effect. But she is not calling humans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the water, the priest is a giant Mori that is no less than Meri. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest stepped back. "The Lord, my strength, I love you!" He whispered, and then kicked forward with ease. The jaw of the jaw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold-blooded reptiles fall into the water faster than they came, and the splashes of water form a narrow mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it’s just a little bit of time, it’s enough for Catherine to climb the back of the crocodile. She’s spotted the black hem that floats in the air, just like losing The scorpion's female leopard slammed into the hijacker as fiercely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is unarmed, but the priest does not doubt that this woman will tear him away with bare hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the premise is that she wants to meet herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest smiled softly, and he took a step back. Catherine tried to stretch her arms in the air, her fingers hit his pants - great. She grabbed his ankle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a pity that the priest is not Achilles, and the ankle is not his key. He can kick Katherine at any time, according to the speed at which he kicks the horse. Starting with strength, Catherine probably won't have the possibility to resurface. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
