			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even if you can," Besib said calmly: "We can't go up too - have you heard it? The stones are rolling and shattering, and Gunshots, the current baptismal hall is still very dangerous. Charlie, your father threw you to us, not letting you die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie raised his chin, Listening hard, but he is just an ordinary person, not an actor like Besib, Sasha and Lila. He can only hear the snoring that comes from far away, he does not I know that this is really what Besib said, or echoing in her own ears, the brown eyes are dull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intellect tells him that Besib’s is probably right, but the feelings don’t allow him to give up easily. The cruelest and sharpest is his Body - When pushing the heavy baptismal pool, his strength was almost exhausted. When Lila "takes" in here, excessive fear and tension have wiped out his last glimmer of energy. His limbs are soft. Lying on the ground, it is difficult to move a finger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So," from now on, "Billy" who kept a regular deep breath to reduce the impact of pain on him, "We... now What should I do?” The pain is still going on. Fortunately, he is getting used to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have a look at whether there are other exits here." Sasha said: "I am going to carry out Charlie, Besib, you are responsible for 'Billy'." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you think this will be?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishb to "Billy" Shot, while crossing his back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Graveyard." Sasha said: "Many monasteries will dig underground rooms to preserve the priests of previous abbots and nobles. But I did not expect this. There are also monasteries and they are quite large in scale."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because The monastery was built on stone," Sasha said. "Don't be confused by the olive groves and flower fields. In fact, as long as you can stand far, then you can guess by following the entire terrain." The place where the monastery was placed was a prominent rock, like a protruding tongue. The tongue is connected to the mountains, so the soil and water are piled up near the base of the tongue, which is why they can pump water on the shallow surface, but the stone is indeed cut under the monastery. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The head said that the monastery has existed for 750 years." Besib asked: "How did they do it?" At that time there was no hydraulic rock drill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Use piety." Sasha said that he stood still. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They met the first door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishb went up and pushed, the door opened, the ordinary metal door, painted with white paint like the top of the metal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After entering, it was still a corridor, door, hallway, door, corridor - they finally saw the room on both sides of the corridor, the white room and the police station Transparent glass is embedded in the upper part of the waist like the observation room used in the hospital. The lights in the room and the lights in the hallway were all open, the lights in the hallway were brighter, and the boys' faces were reflected on the glass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is this?" It looks like a common cooked-out cabinet in a supermarket, just with a huge square head and a side connection of the glass. Two rubber gloves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Biosafety cabinet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looks like two miniature drum washers upside down Something connected together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Automatic Microbiological Analyzer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Electric rice cooker? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Small centrifuge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cash register? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Constant Temperature Mixer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sewing Machine? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The brain stereotactic system."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The microplate reader. Pipettes, dry heaters, electric pipettes, electro-transfer systems, slicers, thermomixers, tissue homogenizers. Vortex, autoclave - where do you use these ghosts? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Biology Lab,” Sasha said. “But I am not sure if this is a second or a third level. Some places are very rudimentary, and some places are very fine.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "The people inside are gone?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go," Sasha said. "Probably as early as those mercenaries entered the baptismal hall for the first time. When they started, they began to withdraw. "Everything has been cleaned up. They walked very calmly, or from a very early age, they were ready to leave at any time - equipment can be bought everywhere, the information needed to carry is just a chip that fits into the shirt pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do we still move on?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha hesitated for a while: "Put Charlie and 'Billy' here, let's take a look."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They didn't open any room. Fresh air, air conditioning equipment is still in operation, the corridor is also very warm, Besib put down "Billy", Sasha touched his neck, the temperature almost burned his hand, he doubted whether Lila’s brain has been Burned up. He held the hand of "Billy" and tried to get a happy memory. It was not easy. All the happy memories of Lila were before the age of five, and the memory of the children was always clear and blurred - it was too little. But "Billy", "Lulu", "Marian" told Sasha, it is enough, they don't need more power for the time being - the body of the abilities is burnt into black carbon, in time, still Can be completely healed - once the owner wakes up, their entire life will be destroyed by her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie is silent all the way. "What those people want is what is inside," he said suddenly. "I am waiting for you here," He calmly pleaded: "But please tell me what it is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha didn’t know what to answer, he wanted to The two men of Sibu continued to go inside. It was also because of this that they could not be caught in a confused way, almost killed, and then escaped in a confused way - they must be careful that the whole thing would have sequelae, in addition, the revenge of the Poseidon Island, Also need to find a real culprit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Charlie is an ordinary person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We will tell you." Besib promised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
