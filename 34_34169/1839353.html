"He said jokingly, but the girl immediately closed her eyes, frowned, turned her head... He knew he had made a mistake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qiz quickly returned, her action just to let the doctor know why she was dissatisfied, she didn’t want to hear anything about Mrs. Carson Things, any news, when he thinks about the woman, his head will squeak - even if it is a small movement, she is tired and panting, the white powder destroys too many things... she does not Appetite, no physical strength, even thinking has become an unbearable burden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha Hopkins is the only sugar in the bitter sea, she sucks carefully, rolling around her teeth, she Carefully hiding its sweetness, but can't help but want to show off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doctors are not a favorite to look at other people’s privacy, but this obviously helps his patients to spend the most painful and difficult Time, so he only listened quietly... The story of Orlosa was not mentioned to anyone, but it is obvious - another standardized hero to save the United States - old-fashioned, ridiculous, Boring, but for thousands of years, this story has always been the most touching, especially the woman's heart. In the description of Chiz Carson, the boy is a Hercules with the appearance of Endignon. (Note 1), the doctor secretly hid his smile under the palm of his hand, pretending that he was moving his tears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chiz pouted at him angrily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please forgive," the doctor thought for a moment and figured out a way to make up for his unintentional loss: "Do you want to see him?" he whispered. "I think I can find him..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stopped and didn't go on again - the girl's joy was on the sly face It’s gone – it’s so short, it’s so hot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," Chiz said: "Absolutely not."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why not? In the mind of a doctor, this teenager may be the best medicine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't think about talking to my mother," Chiz said. "She won't agree."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't tell her."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," Chiz said. She suddenly took a sigh of relief and "it" was coming soon - she knew it was dark and cold. Sinking again...: "No," she insisted. "Don't bother him..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looks out the door, like Mrs. Carson Standing there, but not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are the shadows of the trees, they crawl in from the gap between the window and the door, climb in, climb up the carpet and the raft, black stains...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't let him know..." she whispered, ready to face the pain of the coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire bed was contaminated and the toxic juice dripped from the ceiling. Dropped into her eyes, she groaned, a small bug lays eggs under her skin, the eggs hatch, and the obese larvae get into the blood vessels. The sacs are in pink, flexible tubes. They open small mouths with as many teeth as eight-eye squid. They bite her nerves, like biting crisp leaves and stems. , squeaky. Every time I can make her hurt and scream... Let me go, let me go, she pleads...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She gasps, recalls His arms, arms... and the shower gel with the hotel's unique pine oil – her memory is fragmented, but she remembers being forced torn by a dirty hand. Throwed aside - thick dust, dim light, a child chair painted with red flowers, he hugged her like a child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He found her back, and her. He also helped her clean it because it was stained with ash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she woke up in the hotel room in Orlosa, the waitress who was taking care of her had not returned, and only the big clock in the room was ticking Walking, she was lying on the bed, neatly dressed, her slippers under the bed - she thought everything was her fantasy, no Kaide Carson, no dance, no "dedicated passage", no drugs, also No violent attempt, no... Sasha Hopkins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until she touched the crumpled, wet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bathroom was briefly arranged. She stood barefoot and imagined how he put it on her. Did he see his legs, whether he would be disappointed - she was too thin, with loose flesh on her bones, like a 50-60-year-old woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bug is creeping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not yet time, the bugs say that they grow wings, wings, feather wings, tail feathers, flying feathers, cover feathers, fluff, excitement Her body dragged her wings and climbed up and down, countless tiny feet, with hooks, scorpions, and stamps - it was itchy, itching too much, who can give her a knife, she will Cut yourself out... every inch must be cut open, turned over, spread out, placed under the sun, sunburned, wrinkled, rolled... so that you can sew the bones and the ice in your belly Turned... she was squatting...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nurse fixed the Chiz Carson on the bed with the help of a doctor, her bed was specially customized, and The kind in the mental hospital is exactly the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The translucent white nylon strap crossed the body of Chiz Carson, tied her tightly, and the doctor gave her a sedative. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doctor happened to meet Mrs. Carson on the stairs when he went down. He told her about Qizi, Mrs. Carson’s confused vision. Looked at him: "Isn't she a lot better?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doctor is silent, if he wants to say, he can still say, "Let's go see Look at her." He finally said this: "Attention she may vomit," <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After ten minutes, the doctor came to check the situation of Chiz, his There was still a taste of orange juice and sandwiches in the mouth, and the quarrel between Mrs. Carson and the old Mr. Douglas made everyone in the villa not have a good lunch. Mrs. Carson sat on the edge of the bed, from the gap between the belts. I found the daughter's fingers, holding them, and the eyes fell on the two birds on the carpet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After entering the door, the doctor smelled a sour smell. He felt bad. He rushed to the bed and saw the girl’s face purple. Swelling - the side effects of the sedative made her vomit, and she lay down, and the vomit that could not be poured out blocked her throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Carson didn’t even notice it at all, she was sitting next to Chiz and holding the hand of Chiz. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The identity of the doctor made him unable to say the words of accusation, when Mrs. Carson wanted to cry out loud. He glared at her and the nurse who ran in sent her to the other side of the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where are you going?" the doctor asked sternly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am sorry," said the nurse. "I went to the bathroom."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you Douglas. For Chiz, his heir, this embarrassing old man did not hesitate to spend a lot of money, turned this quiet lakeside villa into a small hospital, Chiz's room is a fully equipped advanced ward and first aid Room, all kinds of equipment hidden behind the tapestry and the screen, they only took a dozen seconds to clear the things blocked in the girl's mouth and the trachea - fortunately, Chiz Carson's bad appetite Reduce their weight and viscosity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While they were busy, Mrs. Carson swayed her hands in vain. Stupid, sitting straight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The color of Chiz Carson is the same as that of Mr. Carson, the old copper coin is polished, the dark golden, with Point Zhu Hong - the mother's hair is both bright and smooth. The daughters, on the other hand, were lifeless, sloppy and scattered on the pillows, and a few small sputum were glued into sputum and blocks, and tears flowed into her hair from the corners of her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl looked in the direction of Mrs. Carson, her eyes were desperate and hateful, she opened her mouth. I tried my best to say something, but the doctor could only hear a few words. He could probably understand the meaning of Chitz. When the vomit poured into her nose, she tried to yell and tried to wiggle. The hand held by Mrs. Carson, but she never found out - you are going to death step by step. And the people around me just need to raise their hands gently, and they can save you when they shout, but she is indifferent - she is still your mother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you imagine? Can you believe it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"嘘-嘘," the doctor said, almost unable to control his pity: "Don't say it. Good boy... she just... just... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qizi looked at him, his throat was alive, and a word could not be said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their family served the Douglas family for generations. When he was a young man, he also had a good feeling for the delicate and delicate Gerry Sherida Douglas, but this feeling was quickly brutally broken - one The brave young man became his forerunner - the young man is a personal assistant of Mr. Douglas, young and handsome, and has a promising future. He was deeply fascinated by Gerry Sherida, although he knew he would never be Wolf Douglas. Mr. is a fair-minded woman, but he boldly sent the first rose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened to the guy? Mr. Douglas did not show his enthusiasm to the young man he had repeatedly praised - his parents were homeless, his brother was dismissed, his younger brother was dropped out of school, he had to stay in prison for twenty-five years, no parole . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just disappeared from the life of Gerry Sherida. She has never asked anyone about his whereabouts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because there is the first one, there is the second one, the third...Gerry Sherida never refuses, she accepts the men’s leisurely Admiration, compliments, invitations and gifts, are so innocent and understanding for everyone, but as long as you go further, you know that you are facing a screen, the people on the screen are perfect, pleasing Like, but when you want to hold her tightly in your arms, you will find that she and you are in two worlds. What you hear and see are fake, non-existent— - It is a delicate skin with a ugly witch who is cold, selfish, and wants to do whatever it wants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women Douglas was carefully selected and finally married her cousin John Carson when she was thirty-two years old. John Carson was also confused by her in the first few months, but the man was much more calm than the others. In less than a year, he was determined to get rid of the name of Gerry Sherida. The mud, they are separated first, and then divorced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody thought that John Carson’s younger brother, Cade Carson, would be captivated by his five-year-old nephew, and he would not hesitate to get her. Killing his own brother-in-law - this is almost an open secret in the Carson and Douglas family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old Mr. Douglas is very angry with this, he did not intend to let Gerry Sherida mix with someone in the Carson family, except that it was God In addition to the cursed, horrible chaos, the old gentleman is also very clear, Kaide Carson is no more than John Carson, he is a screaming little wolf, even if he eats the good meat of Gerry Sherida, Don't expect it to die like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
