			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many parents in this world who have fallen into hysteria or even violent state because their children have not grown into the state they want, but Anthony Hopkins definitely does not. It will be one of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His love for Sasha Hopkins will not disappear because of his change and growth, not only will not disappear, this good emotion is still As time went by, it became deep and dignified... Anthony Hopkins showed a sincere smile, and there were not many chances for this smile to appear on the face of the Ghoul. It was like a winter. The light that occasionally drops in the gray clouds is so rare and hasty, he wants to tell Sasha that he won't do that - he will never leave Sasha Hopkins, just as the tree won't leave its fruit No matter what it is - he almost has to do that. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody knows what happened - a sudden thought pierced the skull of the "Ghoul" like a smashing arrow, piercing him The brain, his teeth are sharpened, his tongue trembles, but he has never issued even a syllable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has confirmed it a long time ago, he and Catherine’s child, his son was killed by the squadron when he was only six years old. And eaten the little sister, the rebirth of Sasha Hopkins, the time flow, the space flip, she returned to the world by Katherine's nutritious uterus, she regained the life she should have Freedom and happiness make Anthony Hopkins very comfortable, but as Katherine said, there are many wonderful places in Sasha Hopkins that reappear in this world. These advantages are not only from the original Sasha, some from Anthony, some from Catherine, and some from their respective parents and even ancestors... Of course, the most of them belong to the younger sister. The part of Sasha, the essence of sweetness, softness, and purity. Other sequins shimmer like rubies, amethysts, and emeralds dotted on precious opals—Anthony Hopkins often stares at his children and tries to find traces of familiarity from him— - His intelligence and agility, his excellent memory, and the kindness, courage and justice he once found in Catherine's body and memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of them, Catherine, this fledgling, slamming, Finnish new FBI agent who has no backstage can dare to The single-handed investigation and pursuit of him, and in the midst of a thousand, he rescued him from the teeth of the enemy who intended to impose cruel lynching - for this she killed one. A servant who was tempted by money to become a minion of another person - she was injured in that operation, but not as heavy as before, the use and harassment of the boss. I am afraid that the media that are not chaotic in the world and the public who do not know the truth will be swaying, and the higher-level department that rushed to launch her to sin is enough to make her feel guilty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was a good opportunity, Hopkins entered her heart, and let her into his memory of memory, Katherine agreed with his ideas. Their opinions coincided to a certain extent. They took a delicious tender brain slice from Kaiserlin’s head boss, then ate some dessert and drank the wine – just that night, Sasha Hopkin Sri Lanka returned to the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Katherine’s former colleagues knew about Catherine’s behavior, they would certainly sternly condemn her or think she had fallen. In fact, she did not, she still kept all her beautiful places. It’s just another way to show it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the umbilical cord conveys nutrients, Catherine passed them to Sasha, so that although Sasha Hopkins was once merciless The ground hurts or kills their enemies, but his heart is still warm and soft - but he loves his father. He followed Anthony Hopkins's order and left Chiz Carson. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened to Chiz Carson made Sasha hurt. But he cleverly hid it, he was so deep that even Anthony Hopkins didn't really understand it - it was like a diseased root, and once the timing was right, it suddenly started - maybe In the first two months of Grande, Sasha had imagined living like an ordinary person, but he soon discovered that it would not work - poor child, he was stuck, his reason told him to be cautious Engaged, and his emotions are eager for an unbridled eruption—especially when Besib is at risk with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Hopkins’ words will help him make a decision – give up, or let go? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If in accordance with his own ideas, Sasha Hopkins will undoubtedly stand on the conservative side, he will not be able to take it easy. Insulting, but not taking the initiative to hurt others, especially those who are not at fault, such as Chizkason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this okay? Hopkins moved his arm and swept his elbows to the glass of wine. The wine glass fell on the floor with the fragrant taste of the wine. The golden ochre liquid jumped on the dark brown floor, crystal clear. The glass fell off the smash. Hopkins turned his head and glanced at it - only one glass of the cup was stopped in the air, the pieces gathered, glued, and the wine returned to the cup, the cup flew to the table, standing Steady - Hopkins stares at it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha was alert and he seized his father's hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The child's heat is passed from the finger, Hopkins feels much better, he closes his eyes, turns to it again in a few seconds - there are no cups on the table Any trace left, a waiter is rushing to clean the floor, and another waiter is bringing a new aperitif. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Hopkins remembers what he said with his wife, Catherine, before he made the decision, he remembered Katherine’s gun, that The Smith-Wesson type 10 police pistol with only six bullets, the bullet that flew out of it had hit a thick badge, heavy, and he inserted it into his boots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he is an average person, Sasha Hopkins can do whatever he wants, but Anthony Hopkins knows what he is - a monk wanted The criminal who has been on the top for many years, a "ghoul" who likes the flesh and blood of the same kind, is a highly rewarded person who can make anyone greedy, even if he has now climbed from the wanted list of the National Violence Agency. Down, and in the short term, greatly reduced his private rewards, but still can not relax his vigilance - the pursuit of his actions may continue until the twenty-second century, and the pervasive hunters will not easily let go of this Calling a wonderful weakness - like Martin yesterday. Hopkins knew that he wanted to be himself. He meant a lot to the young and wretched man - "Ghoul" killed his brother and almost killed him, and as a dangerous person who could be used as a symbol of a certain era, Anthony Hopkins also It means a generous reward and a loud reputation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he doesn’t show up, the thunder will not hesitate to hit Sasha Hopkins, they don’t care if you are really innocent Moreover, Sasha Hopkins is not a pure white lamb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Man is not a minority. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door of the cellar was opened, and the stinky gas came out. They first grabbed Anthony but gave up. Anthony Hopkins's younger sister was crying and pulling away. He rushed over and the door panel pinched his arm. He was so painful that he couldn't see anything, but he couldn't see anything, and he couldn't hear anything. After a while. He smelled the seductive scent - they killed her, chopped it, threw it in the pot and cooked it, and ate it. White snow and black soil left only a few blond hairs and a deciduous tooth - Catherine said that if Sasha Hopkins has claws and cavities, the whole situation may be completely different. . She will not be eaten, she will eat others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eaten by others, or eaten others? Does this still have a choice? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins will not allow people to kill Sasha Hopkins again. There is nothing left to eat her - he can do it, and Sasha can do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Ghoul" bowed his head and put his forehead on the hand that grabbed himself. The hand was hot and the blood flowed under the skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appetizer was delivered. Shrimp and asparagus have a light taste. They didn't talk anymore and ate a good light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then is the main dish today, Sasha likes the goose, it looks as heavy as two pounds, the golden red skin is fragrant and crisp, the meat inside It is soaked in salty juice, the mouth is instant, and it is served with applesauce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the enjoyment of the soft and delicate dessert, Dr. Hopkins has already thought about it, "Go with me," he said: "I will take you Go and see something interesting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha certainly won’t refuse, they walked hand in hand across the street, in the familiar parking lot, Sha saw a behemoth with a shiny black leather shell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This car doesn’t feel even smaller than the school bus. When Shasha walks into it, he doesn’t even have to bend too far. There is a walnut in the car. Black bar, the upper shelf is covered with wine glasses, the white leather sofa is surrounded by a violet marble round coffee table, underneath a soft carpet, facing it with a side decorated with dark glass and rose gold plate wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins turned on the shining ceiling lights that illuminate the dark brown roof, and he walked in front of a matte silver shelf, bent Look carefully at the waist, take a piece from the layered cd and put it into the device. He presses the remote control, and the dark glass is about five feet wide and then gradually lights up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......Hopkins paused, "Don’t worry." He looked at the watch, at 7:1, "We still have some time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins took the sugar cubes, ice water and la fée (distilled absinthe) from behind the bar. According to the promise, he made a cup for his children. A refreshing drink with bitterness, then he poured himself a half cup, pure, without water or sugar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
