			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 177th chapter Ivan (4)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins stands up When Catherine moved to the double-seat table, many people stood up and followed them closely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are men and women, old and young, the only place that can be called similar is the intoxicating and fanatical look, they rub shoulders, Talking to the ear, talking about the incredible good luck of new friends. Some people insist that they have seen this person more than once in the big casino to reward those extravagant VIPs, and some people feel that they are seeing this face in a magazine - they think He is an engineer or a mathematician. Others think that the lucky one for gray-haired hair is only cheating, but it has not been discovered yet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two-game table can only stand up to eight gamblers. The one chosen by Hopkins is relatively empty, but only five positions remain. And only two side by side, one of them is still on the hook (that is, standing at the corner of the table), but Hopkins does not care about this, he stood there, indicating that the dealer made a bet for him: "One thousand, one not By note."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This throwing hand (the gambler who turns the dice) is a full-fledged middle-aged woman with a fat finger on her Diamond ring, the diamond above looks a little smaller than the scorpion: "You will feel remorse, sir." She carefully selected a pair of scorpions pushed by the sergeant with a whip (a small pole that pushes the scorpion). : "Five thousand, one way to note."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the gamblers at the table have cast their bets, the newly joined guests do not hesitate to stand On the side of Hopkins, the supervisor standing in the middle of the two bookmakers looked around and determined that no one had added a bet and then took a slight spot. , Hair dice staff made a gesture of throwing hands can roll the dice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged woman took a deep breath and her face looked awkward because of the tension. And she couldn't help but praying the lips that were painted in purple. She grabbed the scorpion with her arms crossed and her arms crossed her chest. She threw them out while exhaling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her strength is not small, the two nephews slammed over the green countertops, flipped a stack of chips, and slammed into the bet. The inner wall of the platform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scorpion's activity is far less than the ivory ball on the roulette. They didn't take long to stop, and the dealer looked down and looked at it. One, "Junk Point." He clearly announced that the throwing hand looked at his hands. The cheeks trembled violently along with the muscles of the forehead, and she gasped, staring at the two red chips being swept into the dealer's sphere of influence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dealers at both ends of the table consistently started to move the chips on the table, and the supervisors among them watched their every move, and the caller recycled Two dice. Repeated the previous procedure, she picked a pair. When she threw the second time, she put on the light action and appeared seven. "Get off the stage." The dealer announced that the lucky throwing hand was unwilling to go. Two steps back in the counterclockwise direction. Give up her throne. "It's a pity," said the man standing next to Sasha. "If she had cast this number for the first time - it would be wonderful." Not only can it pass, but it will be doubled back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Next, sir?" The thin man shook his head, so he followed the clockwise direction, next to his next gambler. When he made up, he was very nervous. When he picked the dice, he fiddled them all over the place: "Two thousand. Pass the note."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Pukins did not drop the chips. Some people hesitated, but they still voted not to pass the note or pass the note. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Excessively tense throwing hand first cast a five (he almost "crashed bricks". That is, let the scorpion hit the chip, did not touch the inner wall), and finally The result does not belong to the seven, eleven (through the note), nor does it belong to the second, third, and twelfth (not through the note), the banker's action quickly made a mark on the five, the man has the opportunity to continue to throw, in his Before the second throw, Hopkins went up and down five thousand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The throwing hand throws the dice for the second time. The sieve hits the inner wall and stops, and this time is six, he still has a chance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the thrower has voted four times in a row before throwing out seven (that is, the next point), but there are no five, but he is in the penultimate When the time was thrown out of the nine, Hopkins won, and people did not look at the dealer to launch a pure gold chip to Hopkins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The performance of Hopkins on the double-seat table is as good as ever. He has not lost, but the calculation is still more than the losing face. When it was his turn to be a throwing hand, almost all the gamblers who were surrounded by the double-seat table were faintly excited. They believed that he would also be a "good arm" (meaning someone who is good at throwing dice). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins does not live, his first to vote out of a seven when he did turn throwing hand in the second, he threw eleven, these two figures are namely to win, to the third round, half of the gamblers as an opportunity to give up their throwing hand, so that this "good arm" can cast a good dice his two golden as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third time Hopkins did not vote or did not pass the note, he first cast a nine, and then put down ten gold chips, dice send members loudly announced to the people that number, and use this opportunity to vigorously incite other additional stakes gamblers, Hopkins threw in a five-second throw, people sighed softly, but still have a chance - - he voted twice, a three, a four, Hopkins added an additional bet, now twenty golden chips, as long as he can throw out a nine, he can get forty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, his fourth throw was a seven. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chips were quickly taken away, and the gamblers complained that the good-hearted guy patted Hopkins’ shoulders for comfort, and the waiter sent it just right. With the cold champagne, Hopkins looked calm, and he went back to the next one without saying a word, letting another person throw the dice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He became a bit conservative, several times in a row, he only invested a standard bet of 500 to 1,000 yuan, luck seems to be back, he won twice But when he tried to increase his bet, the goddess of fortune floated away again, and he lost. At the same time, the female companions he brought were also lost, and they no longer appeared in gold in front of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This situation is also common in casinos. Other gamblers observed for a while and found that their "new friends" were really weak, so they were twos and threes. The ground spread out - they had already won several of them through Hopkins's east wind, and now it is time to stay away from bad luck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I feel a little weird." Besib said, if the blind man is in the hands of others, in the hands of Hopkins - he does not think This man will not be able to throw the number he wants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s normal to have a win or lose." Sasha said that he took Besib to the two-game table where two or three positions were left. Next, take out the chips that Catherine gave them from the pocket of their clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins blinked at them, and before the start of a new round of throwing, he raised his hand and spent a minute, new chips Come, bright, a total of one hundred golden chips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
