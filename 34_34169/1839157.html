			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Martin laughed and held out his middle finger, a particularly bright and dazzling glare formed on his finger, slamming, purple spherical lightning Launched like a bullet, with a slight whistle, directly into the enemy's chest, and then exploded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ealf member's chest was blasted, his shoulders rolled down on the ground with his head, the air was filled with the smell of barbecue, the white ribs from the black Out of the flesh, the most surprising thing is that he is still alive, his nails draw deep marks on the ground, his mouth is open, his tongue is pulled between the teeth, his nose is bleeding, dark Eyes staring at Martin, like to tie him tightly with his eyes, so that he can be dragged into hell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin opened the diving suit, revealing his shirt, a bright red background, covered with a white tail with a small tail, "嗨"Good evening," he said casually. In fact, he was not sure when it was now. The sky was always gloomy. He didn't care when he was on the watch: "Mr. Dog, dear," he used himself curiously. The foot went to poke the open mouth and slammed back before the mouth suddenly closed: "You are an idiot," he twitched his fingers, and the current between the fingers yelled, "An idiot," He sings and emphasizes, kicking his nose: "They turned you into a beast," he said cheerfully. "But you are willing, are you? You think you can become a handsome werewolf, I didn't expect them to turn you into a dog."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People falling on the ground - no, maybe we can no longer call it "people" Because humans don’t have a dog’s head, a pure one, can fill one Washbasin, a large dog head, black nose, dark brown fur covered in long snout, ears erected, close to the skull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It looks better than your friend." Martin said, while he was playing with the toes of the dying person, he saw the photos, black. The dog's head and the human man's body, if not the information given by the institution, he absolutely does not have the imagination to link the two together. A group of madmen, although he sometimes admits that he is a madman, but he will not be so crazy with them - in order to be able to completely stand on the opposite side of humanity, they can even abandon human dignity, body and mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, they can change more than just the body. You don’t have to dissect Martin. You can guess that the muscles that broke out have squeezed the part of the brain that belongs to humans from the ears. Pressed out, otherwise the waste under his feet will not do such a stupid thing - the gun is on his side, he wants to complete the change and then kill the three gadgets - perhaps because he feels tearing It would be a pleasant thing to kill a few devils in person, but the fact is that his movements are too slow, and he even married a deadly guy in Martin before he even walked to the prey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meat at Martin's feet was motionless. The members of ealf had already spit out the last breath. His brain stopped thinking and the nerves did not respond. Martin unknowingly dissipated the lightning in his hand, but he soon I found another thing worthy of his attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened to the little devil?" He reached out and hooked the arm of a special operations team member - they were helping the hostages evacuate, he was holding a child The child's face was buried on his shoulders - Martin's eyes were glued to the golden brown back of the head, and the back of the head was very familiar, but he couldn't remember where he saw it for a while. I have been there - Martin grabbed the child's hair, he had to look at his face, that face... His hand suddenly bent over and gave him a slap in the face! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing, Martin Shaw?" The head stood at the door, and his face was almost "impatient" and "violent" and "tired" The mixture is made up, his headache is splitting, tearing his own spirit, and then attaching it to other human beings is not a simple matter. If he is not careful, he will become an idiot or a schizophrenic person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think you should be more concerned about the pile on the ground now! Look at the orders and reminders that I have not made twenty times before the action!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin licked his teeth, the slap in the face was not light, his ears creaked, he clenched his fists, and the current rushed through his fists - his The ability has been significantly improved in the last year. In addition to the original flaky lightning, linear lightning, and chain lightning, he can create a stable spherical lightning like the 17th century scientist Nikola Tesla. And command them accurately, this powerful, and able to cross the lightning of any object under certain circumstances, so that the upper eye of the body is bright, Martin got all the things he wanted, money, honor overnight. , status - but still not enough to compare with the former "head", he only swallowed that tone, "obey," he said in a sigh of relief: "as you wish." He turned and went. Sneaking out the small ball that has formed in the palm of your hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The pile on the ground" was quickly converged, and according to the previous agreement, they belonged to the organization. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;swat and hrsf have nothing to say, the things they encounter are too unbelievable and difficult to cope with. If there are no "special members" of the organization, the chances of this action failing Will be much greater than success. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But what exactly is it?" The head of swat asked: "Who is the monster created? Is it God or the devil?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God and The devil is omnipotent," hrsf's chief replied calmly. He raised his hand and took care of his collar: "But only humans have no hesitation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** *<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abel took a deep breath, and the salty droplets jumped into his mouth, with a little sweet smell - thought of not long ago What happened here, he couldn't help but want to vomit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He bowed his head and spit on the dark sea sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a line of sight on him, Abel raised his head alertly, the people around him came and went, dressed in black diving suits, wearing guns - swat and hrsf Members or institutional companions - the latter tend to be far from him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No captives, no living ealf members. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Streif retracted his gaze and was swaying From the seaside, he was sitting across from Kaisheng, and the faces of the members who were out of danger were not happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that ealf members have not only killed a little girl, but the reporters who came to the invitation of Kaishengguo and the staff were broken on the first day. The head was thrown into the sea just because they were young and strong and difficult to control - and the daughter of Kaishengguo was part of ealf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where is she?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We also want to know this question." HRsf's sergeant Nodded: "Their leader, that is, Somitri has escaped. It is possible that he is with your daughter. Do you know where your daughter will go?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kai Shengguo was silent for a while, "I don't know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hrsf's chief shrugged, not surprising: "So, If you think of something, feel free to ask me." He raised his hand and walked away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little boy floated on the sea and gradually approached the yacht. The yacht was 85 feet long, and the white hull was written with a bright red "Yong'an", which cost about 500,000 yuan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is Kai Yongan, which was given to her by Kaisheng when she was 18 years old, as an adult gift. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stuhloff declined the help of others. He held Sasha and grabbed the rope ladder, just as easy as a puppet carrying a cub. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha sneezes and grabs the cloth on his father's chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kaisheng eyes that boarded the ship early on stared at them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Yong’an,” he shouted hoarsely, then fell into a coma under the influence of sedatives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The yacht left soon, the storm once again hit, the sudden seems to have never Did not leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A person is on the dock at a pier about two kilometers from the 19th district. This is a remote, almost deserted dock, on the dock. There was an empty, small room that used to entertain visitors. He was covered in water and walked into the house with difficulty, squatting around, squatting down a corner, and prying a piece of wood (covering a few inches thick) Dust and cobwebs, take a small bag from inside and stuff it into your arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he came out, the rain grew bigger and he didn’t have a person on the dock. He walked for nearly four hours along the road to see the first family. The careless owner parked a 50% new Honda car outside the garage, and the fugitive accepted the gift he was desperately pleased. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hurricane driving not only requires technology, but also luck, Somitre’s technology and luck are good, although he can hardly see three meters away. Things, the wind is constantly throwing things up on the windshield - condoms, magazines, iron pieces, cement blocks... all-or--the most dangerous is a branch that is as thick as an adult's thighs. It slammed into the roof of the car, knocked out a large pit of the head, and a high-voltage line with a dazzling arc. It flew past the window and the electric flower illuminate the entire car. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, after more than an hour, Somitre returned to his safe and warm secret nest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The car was hidden in the garage, Somitre's advanced kitchen, where there was a cup of Jamaican coffee, half distilled, half of the coffee, and it was hot and hot immediately. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a shower, changed his dry clean clothes, and took off one of the contact lenses. I just put out a small bag with a passport and a large denomination of cash. The passport is true. The person on the passport is certainly not Somitre, but the face is similar, only the hair and eyebrows are not like this problem. It can be solved with hair dye and eyebrow pencil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned on the computer and set a ticket for tomorrow with a new passport. There have been preliminary reports of hostage incidents on the Internet. They have not mentioned Kemira yet. Or Kai Yongan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somitre’s facial sketch appears on the screen, lifelike, ealf’s former leader cursed annoyedly, in fact, he can use his other Identity, that identity is truly perfect, impeccable, but Somitre hates it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cup is empty, he stands up from the table, wants to add something, maybe pure whiskey? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smells a special taste, people often smell this in pet hospitals, veterinarians use it to anesthetize animals, a group of soaked in Luo Luofang The cotton cloth was pressed against his face by a strong hand, and the other arm was firmly fixed, holding his arms like a cockroach, his feet were kicking on the floor, and the chair was turned over. The computer was dragged down and the shell was broken on the floor. Somitre tasted the sweetness, and his body became soft and slippery like the heated butter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he woke up, he was dizzy, and his throat was like a knife inserted, and the knife was still stirring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tape and the rope fixed him in the chair, straight, and Streiff sat across from him, sitting across the other chair, behind him It is the window, the storm is over, the sun is like gold, the leaves are like jade, the dew is like a diamond, and the air is fresh, just like it was transmitted directly from the White Age. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good morning," said Streif. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somitre tried to swallow and found that he could talk, although it was painful, but could bear: "Good morning." He whispered slowly and whisperingly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Streif 舔舔finger: "I hope to finish early," he said. "The previous things made us all very hard, huh? Mr. Mitre, we have to get straight to the point." He made a gesture: "The first question, we are not meeting for the first time, are we?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Before that, I am not sure."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Love Ben State Psychiatric Center g, on the corridor of the violent mental ward, Mr. Anthony Hopkins, Ghoul, I can't say that I am very happy to meet you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "You can get close to you, Mr. Somitre."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," said Somitre, his voice hoarse like It was swallowed charcoal: "But I didn't want to be your enemy, I just want to make sure..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you sure?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know, Sol Terre readily replied: "I do not know, perhaps only felt once again in order to understand what it was I did not hurt you, I'm not your enemy.." He notes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about the island of Kamala?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That was an accident," Somitre seems to be sincere and sincere: "Kemira didn't tell me that you and your son would go too."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Street Eyes, "Second question, what about Kemira?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are late," Somitre said regretfully: "She is in six I broke up with me a few hours ago. I don't know if she went there. Have you ever been to her father?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ghoul smile, a pure The smile, the wrinkles on the corners of the eyes are very deep: "Lie lie in the sky." He put a finger on the back of the chair: "Know that honesty is virtue, Mr. Somitre, or more accurately, Kemira, Kaiyong Miss."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somitre rolled his lips and wanted to make a mocking sneer, but the dark gray-blue eyes of the ghoul made him close. Mouth, the expression on his face gradually disappeared, and eventually it was blank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How did you find out?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Straef moved his finger: "At first it was Some kind of feeling, then some features, I mean, the special skin folds in the corners of the eye and the smell of gardenia perfume," he inhales: "It surprised me, it's a very interesting ability. Specifically It is the dog and the squid that inspired me. I believe that a leader is necessarily higher than the wild animals. The squid is a kind of creature that determines its own gender according to the situation - high density, lack of food. When it is a male fish, on the other hand, it is a female, hey, it is a male when Somitre appears, and a female when it is needed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "...What do you want?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your father is rewarding you, through some path that is not very public, he wants you to go home, Safe and sound, I think he has already prepared for you to retreat. How? Lost lamb wants to go back to Dad? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somitre (Kemila) has a disgusting expression on his face. "Don't be kidding," he said happily. "This idea is It’s so bad and smelly like a salted fish. I don’t like Kaisheng and I don’t want to see him. Even if you have caught me, it’s useless.” He raised his eyebrows: “I won’t be Camilla again. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Streif shook his head pitifully: "This is not for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pair The little hand stretched out from the back of Somitre's neck, and the delicate fingers held his head, and the power poured directly into each of his nerves like boiling water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s the feeling that Somitre is struggling wildly, the chair is swaying in the violent front and rear swings, and he almost gets rid of Sasha’s control. Fortunately, Treff rushed in time and pressed him to the ground. His knees pressed Sumitre's chest and waist tightly, and the iron-clamped hands clasped the latter's arms and sprinkled. Kneeling down on the carpet, overlooking the face condescendingly, the force he ignited rushed through the male body, forcing it to change its intrinsic shape - Somitre's facial contours became smooth in a matter of minutes. The limbs are shortened, the skin is thinned, the chest is raised, and the knot on the neck is rapidly disappearing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kemira is back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kemira has been missing for more than a year, what happened when she reappeared I don't remember. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the Kay talents know that this girl is soft and sweet, but the opposite is true. The girl returned to Kay a year ago, her father and brother This each paid two million. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she was sent back, her hair was shaved and her bandages were wrapped around her head. After the doctor’s examination, she was surprised to find that part of her brain was removed. She became very docile, but stupid. Kay managed to conceal the news from the outside world. Kemira was sent to a private nursing home. After a year, her hair covered her scars. At least she had recovered from the surface. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kai’s family cares about her as always, and the wife of Kaishengguo supervises her taking medicine, checking, eating three meals a day, bathing, sleeping, exercising – When Kai Yongping is busy buying back the new Tianjiu wing, he will remember to take his sister to go to the courtyard (otherwise she will stay in the room), and the Kaisheng country who is participating in the election of the state legislature will also Take time out of your busy schedule to accompany her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you think it's okay?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am fine, Dad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you want some tea?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, Dad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The weather is very good today."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "It's very good, Dad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I love you, Yongan."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I love you too, Dad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(End of this volume)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
