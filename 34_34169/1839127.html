			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;April 31st of each year is the day of the St. Thomas Church Primary School, just the day before the summer vacation. On that day, all parents will be invited, and the students will need to arrive early in the school, and then they will be busy with the guidance and help of the teachers... except for reading, music, singing, sign language, static calligraphy, cooking, embroidery, sewing, etc. In addition to the work of painting and crafts, the St. Thomas Church Elementary School has a traditional program that lasts for more than 70 years. The Ascension Day is on Thursday, the fortieth day after Easter, although the annual date is uncertain, but Thomas Church Elementary School always staged religious dramas related to it on the morning of the school day. Some children who performed well on weekdays were selected to play Jesus, his disciples and related people. The school workers set up corresponding scenes, teachers, Parents and other children sit in the audience and sing hymns. Finally, the parish priest extinguishes the Easter candle lit by the reading platform, symbolizing the death of Jesus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Jesus, it was a rich and delicious meal for parents and students. The dessert was 30 feet long and 12 feet wide. Creamy strawberry cake, enough for 580 adults and 300 children to share. Parents and children spread out in this sweet atmosphere. Some parents danced happily in the background music (organist). From the age of six to eleven, most of the children were holding cakes, drinks and snacks. In the lawn and the woods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black hair, gray-blue eyes, Streiff stood in the hall for a while, he was looking for Sasha Streif, but could not find He waited patiently for a while and then turned back to the third class classroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Humbert’s office furniture combination with a small screen has been removed, replaced by a silver-gray series that meets the preferences of the new responsible person. The dark wood called "silver enamel" is inlaid with black cowhide in the middle, the center of the table, the front of the drawer, the cushions, backrests and armrests of the chair. The small handles of each chrome-plated stainless steel are shiny and shiny. Dr. Hopkins bowed his head. He carefully looked at a large drawer on the ground floor with twice the size of the same type. It was closed like other drawers, and the small nerve that touched the sharp nerve was - Its shiny surface is covered with fingerprints. The man who was called "the devil" by his peers in psychiatry bent down one knee. Now he sees it more clearly. The fingerprints are very clear, and they can almost distinguish between "ro" and "spin". Hopkins stretches. Take your own hand and compare it. Make sure the owner of the fingerprint is no more than 10 years old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you bother?" A voice asked hard behind him: "Mr. Streif?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins straightens his body and turns around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Boro stood at the door of the classroom, her face was very poor, her eyes filled with suspicion and anger, she looked at Hopkins, and her eyes were like A handful of sloppy awl - if possible, she might make a hole in this fascinating man and see what kind of dirty things are inside: "Please do us a favor, good "Let's not move when standing there," she said as she stepped forward, saying, "Standing there, nothing needs to move."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henbot Mr. followed closely behind Mrs. Borrow, and he did not stole Steve, his eyes only drifting around his desk. There are two teachers behind him, one man and one woman. The men are quite sly to say hello to Streif, while women are a bit of annoying color - not for people, but for things, obviously She did not want to be involved, but had to cooperate - Mrs. Boro had absolute authority in this school, and Mr. Humbert was the head of the place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Open the drawer," said Mrs. Boro, "all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Hopkins is pleased. He does not touch the handle. Instead, he uses his fingers to pick up the lower edge of the drawer and open them one by one. The drawers are basically documents, books, and books for preparing lessons. There are almost no private individuals. The items are neatly discharged and can be seen at a glance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are still boxes." Mrs. Boro said that Dr. Hopkins found her tone softening, with some hesitation and instability. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened the box, wrapped in black calfskin, the silver corner box with a password lock, containing the children's transcripts and exam papers, Bo Mrs. Luo stepped forward and pulled out one or two from inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You did a good job." Mrs. Boro said that the shoulders she had been tightening since she came in had completely relaxed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can I know what happened?" asked Dr. Hopkins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Boro used his index finger to top his temple, "I am sorry..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait a minute," Humbert suddenly interrupted her: "If you can, Mr. Streif, there are clothes..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Henbo Mr. Te!" Mrs. Boro whispered in disapproval. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please," Humbert turned a deaf ear: "The jacket pocket, and the trouser pocket."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I thought the humiliating punishment was banned by Roberts Bill as early as 1784." Dr. Hopkins said in a polite, squeaky voice that we are familiar with: "So, at least , a reason."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Boro’s face was a little worse than before entering the classroom, she moved her feet uncomfortably, the heel in the classroom The rustling sound on the floor: "We received a complaint - sorry, can't tell you who made the complaint - after the religious drama ended, a little girl found herself stolen when she changed the costume." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She said she saw you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the quiet path, Dolores is behind Sasha, the little girl is flushed, she constantly wants to pull the arm of Sasha, but always The little boy who was short on her head cleverly escaped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Return it to me," she lowered her voice as much as possible: "That's mine, my...pants."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know," the little boy replied coldly: "I watched you stuff it into my father's desk drawer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry," Dolores began to pant. She ran two steps. This time Sasha let her catch herself: "God, this is just a joke!" She screamed Road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha looked at her, the little girl’s skin and hair were still wet, and today’s religious drama is “Jesus walks on the water”, unexpectedly, recently Not so lovable, Dolores had the privilege of playing Peter, one of the twelve disciples, and one of them had to really jump into the water. Of course, the water-soaked clothes needed to be replaced. After changing clothes, she I had to rush back to the other people to call the curtain, so the wet clothes (including) that were replaced were not put back in the storage box, but were casually thrown on the platform where the portraits were placed. At that time, almost all People are waiting on the lawn for the end of the final scene, except for Mr. Streif, who was ordered to go to the restaurant to inspect the food preparations. If it was a joke, the characters who worked in this joke would have been too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
