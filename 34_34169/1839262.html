In the afternoon, they read a book in the library for a while (Sasha sees a collection of religious poems from the Middle Ages, while Besib looks at a book of Mondrian. The face of the son of the thug leader was incredible throughout the process - in his eyes, all the master's paintings consisted of lines and filled three primary colors in the line and a small amount of gray and black - everyone Be able to do this work, Besib said in his heart, draw a grid, fill the color, even if it is just a monkey, as long as it is well trained, this will not be too difficult work.) And two adults are not far from them. The place, Catherine sat silly and looked at the scenery outside the window, and Hopkins set up a drawing board, fixed a thick, large, slightly yellow paper, holding a charcoal in his fingers, elbows Dry bread (acting as a pen wipe) and come In the Rheingau white wine of noble rot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hop Hopkins only gives portraits to those who love and know, but what he describes is not the object presented to the secular, visible to everyone, the usual The superficial face and body in the sense, but the real and profound images that are hidden but exposed in his eyes and thoughts, just like he once gave newspapers that are being favored by the monks, blindly ignorant people, smuggling revenge The boss and the head of the eagerly minded people were forced to go to the almost unrequited portrait of Catherine (who was not his wife at the time), and he painted Katherine’s head on a small piece of parchment (and the tabloid Just the same!), adding the lion's body and wings under her pretty neck, with a short verse - he still remembers the poem, he described her in the verse as a honey in the lion's belly, metaphor It is a delicious taste that only the brave can taste. The letter was detained by someone using his authority and opened the gap - Mason. Hopkins’s biggest enemy sixteen years ago, got the letter from Catherine’s boss. He knew that Hopkins was interested in the girl and used her as a bait – the noose that was thrown It really caught the neck of the "Ghoul", but the only thing they didn't expect was that Catherine, a small piece that seemed to have lost its effect and was inconspicuous, would flip the whole situation at the last minute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins doctor raised his lips, he had to admit. It was Katherine who saved his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought he would always remember how Catherine walked quietly through the door of the feed room and walked to the warehouse center. Then let her little dog with a zero-four-caliber blast in the air; at that moment, he was stored in a few rooms closest to the gate, he could always use it - Mason called one to help, His gun was hung behind his buttocks. When he wanted to pull the gun, Catherine fired two shots and the bullet passed through the badge. After piercing the heart behind the badge, after that, he can be sure that his little girl may break free from the shackles of her parents, teachers, neighbors, friends, colleagues, society and other ghosts. The so-called "criteria" and "moral" in her mind, she finally knows what she wants and does, she has her own brain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just like having a foundation, he can teach her how to build a house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine is a good student. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thick black charcoal falls on the first few seconds of the paper. Dr. Hopkins looked at Catherine. There are a lot of people who can see one of the twin sisters (brothers) can't help but compare her (the other) with another, but in Hopkins' view, the difference between Catherine and Catherine is simply clear. It was cut with a ruler and a utility knife. This is this, that is the one. Compared to her sister, Catherine’s impulsiveness, childishness, and indecision have reached a rather terrible level. Her heart seems to remain at a certain stage in the past. Did not grow up, not mature. There is nothing that can leave traces on it... Oh, maybe someone will say that we should remove Catherine, but Hopkins’s feelings have never been missed – Katherine is not that important to Catherine. Yes, at least not as important as she thought. Catherine is not a special person. She and every ordinary person who is too weak to face up to her own kindness - blaming everyone in the day, complaining, trying to push every mistake made by him to something else. ... It is best to be a bad luck who will never jump out to tear off this sad illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They will also set up an unattainable and dazzling goal, and then tell them that they are unable to reach their wishes because of the mistakes made by the unlucky one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This way they will be happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Catherine, her forced separation from her twin sister Catherine is the opening wedge of a great tragedy, all her frustrations and pains are from Here, she always chanted Catherine, praised for a while, cursed for a while, loved her, and hated her, she hoped that Catherine could return to her side, as if she could get rid of the filth and shadow shrouded in her body. Become a pure and noble new human. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, Catherine died, but she found Sasha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins found that his thoughts were flying too far. He drank a little bit of honey, apricots and peaches, sweet. For the warm liquid, gently scrape the charcoal pen with the fingernail's nails. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha licked his cheek and yawned. He glanced at his father, adjusted his posture, and decided to take a nap. Besib had already taken the lead. Closing his eyes, Sasha's head can just rest on his soft stomach. He doesn't know if he should put the book back in place. Finally he closes the book and holds it on himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door to the terrace of the library is open. After washing through the woods and the pool, the hot air born in the desert is also mild and sweet. They crept through the room, licking the inner curtain of the yarn and the soft hair of human beings. Do not leave a little bit of sand and dust. The pool of water that is changed daily reflects the sun, and the shimmering light spots create beautiful and refined images on the furniture and walls. There is no embarrassment here, although the city’s hustle and bustle is not long, but it is already far enough away from the distance. The quiet surroundings can make people hear their own breathing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sound of charcoal and rusks sliding on the paper - Dr. Hopkins completed the small painting in half an hour, he was alone Quietly bowed for a while, picked up the rusks, and wiped it clean little by little—starting with the first portrait of Sasha. He just did it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dinner is very simple, not much, Catherine is nervous, and Both Hopkins and Besib know that at this time, don't let too much blood flow to the stomach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red Hair Judas cares for Catherine, her skills are delicate and delicate, and occasionally her fingers rubbed over the earlobe, cheeks or forehead. When Catherine looked at him from the mirror, he Like a shark, his white teeth were exposed. Catherine found that his upturned eyes were deeper when he smiled, feeling a bit soft or feminine. But in contrast, his eyebrows are thick like those painted with charcoal pencils, and his eyes are deep. The nose is straight, the lips are thin and red, and the skin of the wheat is so beautiful that it becomes a very attractive male, looking at the appearance. No one would have thought that this person had never hesitated, and even said that he was happy to help him. Catherine didn’t know what the woman who was acting as a fake gambler finally did, but she knew the taste of beating and rape, she had I am impulsive, I want to catch Judah's fingers and let him "enjoy". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the green eyes also arrived. He brought Catherine and Hopkins, as well as Besib's clothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All clothes are custom made, Catherine's skirt is black satin. The chest and skirt are embroidered with silver. The satin is like flowing water under the light. She wants to touch it, but then she remembers the romance she had seen. The heroine inside wants to reach out and touch the satin. The clothes were trimmed and ordered to wear gloves first. Because the finger will leave a fingerprint on the smooth satin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, they first put on her gloves. Judah put a scarf on her head, and the dress was put on her head. When it touched the skin, the feeling of coldness and smoothness made Catherine shrug her back and shoulders. The staff pulled a zipper on her back, every inch. It’s just right, “There is this,” said: “The private gift of Mr. Shane Battier.” It’s an inverted pyramid-shaped diamond necklace with a dark blue sapphire about five carats hanging from the end, with Catherine. The eyes complement each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The news of Mr. Shane Battier is not too slow." Besib whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha shrugged his shoulders: "Very good, Catherine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boys earlier Dressed neatly in one step, custom-made clothes are more suitable for them than the previous ones. They have not really grown to a stage that can be called a "man", but it has made it difficult to remove the line of sight. The bangs of Besib were strongly restricted by the waxing, and the bare forehead was rarely revealed. The color was lighter than other places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha's hair color is the same as that of Kaiserlin, but the hair is ruthlessly followed by Hopkins, both thin and soft, slightly combed and Applying the styling water can be very smooth. Judah wiped Katherine's side and walked over to him carefully, and then pulled out a few hairs from the forehead, which was much more natural. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins doctors continue to comb all the hair back, he combs his hair, meticulous and slow, just like preparing for coronation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shawn Battier arrived a few minutes before they left, and he personally sent $10 million in cash and more money. Hopkins picked up a banknote, all new, one hundred yuan denomination, exudes ink scent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is still something to say to you," Sean Battier said. "I bought it for five million dollars just half an hour ago. The dealership of the No. 3 Baccarat table was placed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(To be continued)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ps :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apologize to the readers! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s been broken for so many days... Before the National Day, the work was too tight, and there were too many people and units involved in my work. I have to contact, and every one has to be traced - the most distracting thing is that I have run into a villain! This villain also has a certain status and power in the company (different departments), inexplicably sent a good fire to me, saying that I don't answer the phone, please, I have already taken a mobile phone with dinner, but the construction site There is a tower nearby, which will affect the mobile phone signal. I can’t help but go to the construction site. After that, I’m still in the end of the balabala. I’m talking about some inexplicable nonsense... I’m going to have more things to do, and I go home every night to the computer. Just a word can't be coded! I finally wrote a chapter, how to see how dissatisfied, deleted a part of the rewrite... or not! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
