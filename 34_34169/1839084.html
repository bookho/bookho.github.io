			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At about 5:30 local time, Katherine and Jack took the passenger plane to Brazil's Amazon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike cia, dia and other departments, semi-national semi-private "institutions" are loose and amazing, big and small heads and brains for the squatting The management is quite broad, especially in terms of money, and it can almost be said that they are fully satisfied with the requirements of the hunting and tracking team members who are almost always in a state of tension. For example, this time, Jack was not comfortable enough to seat, no charging position for laptops, and the LCD screen for playing movies was not enough to pass a full three passenger planes, and finally Katherine turned his anger into a hot magma. Before the spray came out, it was very reluctant to set two business class tickets for this luxury airliner. Even so, he still has a little complaint, because the 190 cm long, 70 cm wide seat is really small for a man with six feet and three inches and a weight of two hundred pounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there was a lot of dissatisfaction with Jack’s arrangement, when she was lying flat, she pulled a soft blanket on the business class seat that was completely the same as the bed. When preparing for a comfortable little break, I decided to stop thinking about the sins of delaying the two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Catherine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you want to eat chocolate?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, thank you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a pity, it’s chocolate, it’s filled with Junducheng and French cognac, which is very good.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jack doesn't seem to want to rest, across a three-foot-high soft leather barrier in the shape of a "?" and a slightly higher, translucent frosted glass screen that Katherine can hear. He tapped the sound of the laptop keyboard, and the slight snoring sounded particularly clear in the quiet personal space, as if it was raining with a small hail, and people would be sleepy for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Catherine, you have a twin sister, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes." Catherine loosened her hair and let it squirt like a melted gold on a white pillow, then turned over and said vaguely: "In the orphanage, we separated, you know , Jack."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of typing on the keyboard stopped for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I know, what is her name... You told me, Catherine, she is also called Catherine."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack caught a large amount of chocolate in his mouth, a picture on the screen flashing the name of Catherine, her face is similar to Kaiserlin around him Extremely, the only difference, perhaps the eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlike the blue eyes of the latter, her eyes are purple, similar to the color of the violet in the rain, very beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;..................<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A black crocodile is slowly drifting at the Ariau Hotel for The creek crawled under the wooden bridge built by the passengers. The creek was formed after the rainstorm. It was very clear and warm, but like its other companions, its existence would be very short-lived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black crocodile looked up for a long time and stared at the wooden bridge. There were constantly monkey-like creatures appearing. Their movements were much more clumsy than the monkeys, and they were much bigger, so it was full of hope. The wooden bridge will suddenly break like the vines in the rain forest, let the meat that looks good, scream and fall, it is best to fall into your mouth - as the biggest crawl in the jungle Animals, it has always been thought that being like a small crocodile is a very unconventional thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呸!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joe spit on the crocodile under the bridge, he certainly knows What is the black scorpion that looks like a moldy tree. To be honest, he would like to pull out the gun to give the guy a bit, but this is a violation of the rules, and will scare the nearby guests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guest, he stumbled, not far from him is the 6th room like a big bird's nest, it stretches out on a narrow platform, elegant The gentleman is holding his little daughter, and the seemingly docile Mori is enjoying the less common sunshine in the rainforest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s that damn soft reptile that forced him to kick Ram out of Aria. Ram is a good boy, but he can't imagine what it would be like when a guest finds that the guard is more afraid of a snake than himself. The owner of the hotel is a mean person. He will not consider the physical or psychological condition of the person as he said in the book. When he receives a complaint from the customer, the only thing he will do is to expel the unlucky one. Ghost, then called the person in charge to smash the meal and warned him that if there is another time, it is two people who will get out of here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of Joe’s heart is very uncomfortable here, especially when he thinks he has to adjust the guard’s duty table to feel more headaches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps I forgot to say that this sturdy person who removed his limbs looks like a casks is the head of the Ariawu Hotel Guard, he and one Twenty-two young and strong young men are responsible for the safety of the hotel and the nine superior rooms surrounding it. The 365-day-a-day duty and patrol arrangements are arranged by him. Although Joe is not as rude and stupid as his appearance, this matter has been done for several years and there has been no mistakes, but at any time, facing the dense forms is a thing that will make him suffer. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Joe, can you please come over?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gentleman with blue eyes He has also seen Joe. He lifted his body and whispered. His tone was full of disturbing courtesy. Joe was very familiar. He had seen many people with identity. They would never be as big as the nouveau riche. Shouting and yelling will only "request" what you are going to do for him with a gentle voice that has almost no ups and downs, but this "request" is more uncomfortable than the command of the former, because of this "request" There is often no room for shirking or hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, sir, I will come here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jo answered, in a hurry Smoothly walked over to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony stood up and watched the big man walk along the delicate pedals into the corridor of the hexagonal tree house, and the pedals continued to linger under his boots. Loud, people are worried that he will fall directly into the over-luxuriant trees in the next moment, killing a squirrel monkey who is not lucky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The facts prove that people’s fears are superfluous, because Joe quickly stood in front of Anthony, covering most of the sun’s huge body and reminding Anthony The person who met before in a less friendly place, he was responsible for guarding Anthony, and also an Anthony student, he switched between these two identities, no matter what kind of work is not bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please sit, Joe, please sit down. You can try this berry, it's a bit sour, but it's refreshing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you." Joe grabbed it. The hat, then clumsily sat down cross-legged, and the people in front of him were lying on the rattan couch like the nobles of ancient Rome, holding the green fruit in their hands. Just as Joe thought that his next sentence would be like Caesar in the movie: "Caesar's return to Caesar, God's return to God." When he opened his mouth: "If you can, Joe, I want to book a A small motorboat, tonight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Night? Of course, of course."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't follow anyone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can...oh, no." Joe shouted in surprise: "The jungle at night is quite dangerous! Sir, look, He tried to avoid angering the guests with a gentle tone: "Our accompanying personnel are professionally trained. They not only guarantee your safety, but also provide all kinds of trivial services to make you more enjoyable, and I promise, When you want to be quiet, they will not send out anything other than breathing, and will never make things that scare off your fish or something like that."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, but I really don't need it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Persevered, then he took out two volumes of "green baby" that Joe liked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One volume is rent, one volume is yours."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jiao slightly considered it "You have to pay the ship's deposit, sir." He picked up two rolls of money: "I still remind you that the jaguar in the Amazon jungle likes to give a passionate hug from behind." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Isn't that an interesting thing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony looks at the side and entangles with Mori Sasha, playing together, is happily authentic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Joe looked at him incredulously: "Well, Ariawu's mission is to satisfy all the needs of the guests."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood up and stuffed the money into his pocket of a safari uniform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you are looking for death, who can stop you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He said in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;..............................<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh... look at that beauty "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack stood on the marble floor of the airport in Manaus, the capital of Brazil's Amazon, and smiled to a brownish wave. The plump beauty is smug, his tall figure, handsome appearance, coupled with enthusiasm but not wretched eyes immediately exchanged the latter's charming winking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If there is still a cumbersome thing around," Jack said with regret, grabbed the Catherine who was about to walk away: "I think I can There is a good time. Catherine," he said with a low voice: "The 22 most dangerous airports in the world, it ranks eighth. You can be angry with me, but definitely can't leave me unless You want to be one of the new items in an underground casino or tomorrow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just want to know how long you want to delay, the atmosphere here makes me very uncomfortable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So let's go now."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jakela Kaiserlin quickly walked out of the airport lobby, with huge noise and The glaring sun filled Kaiserlin’s already groggy head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go to Ariau."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey! Is Mr. Jack White and his wife?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dark-skinned young man stands in a brand new In front of the raceable sedan, he shouted at the big sign with the names of the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When did I become..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, Catherine, you don't Is it more convenient to feel this? The beautiful and mysterious Amazon travel, full of curiosity, the Jack White couple has nothing to do with the relationship between the two, and the young men and women who probe the brain all day are not noticeable. "Yes," Jack pulled a silver ring from his left hand with three rings. Regardless of Kaiser's resistance, he was on her left ring finger: "I won't ask you to fulfill your obligation as a wife." , but in exchange, you have to allow me to go out of my way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You disgusting guy! Go to hell!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She likes to call me like this," Jack explained to the young man in fluent Portuguese. The latter looked at the angry Katherine and gave Jack an understanding. Smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Daga asked me to tell you that he wished you a happy new marriage. Please forgive me, he can't pick you up in person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, tell him, there is a car, as for whether he came to pick me up personally... I will not ride his car before I plan to commit suicide. Jack pushed Katherine into the carriage and shook hands with the young man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a map on the car and a satellite navigator, I hope you won't get lost."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think my luck will not be so bad, goodbye, thank you very much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack came out of the cab and shook hands with the young man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Goodbye!~ I wish you a good trip!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young people are behind the starting car Shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a passionate person, don’t you think so? Catherine.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "How do you know that the goal is in Ariawu?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Katherine’s answer, Jack only shrugged: "You remember we are in Lobos." Is the consumption record found on that? Mr. Anthony Hopkins."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
