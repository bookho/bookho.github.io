			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John Carson walked into his daughter's room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no hotel in Poseidon, and "Tang" prepares a three-story sea-sand building surrounded by large olives and celestial grasses. The doors and windows are sapphire blue, the edges of the balcony are inlaid with black grille railings, the middle section is swelled out, like a hip of the windy girl - no screens, no air conditioning, sea breeze through the room day and night, with To the fresh air and moisture, the paint on the wall has been a little off, especially near the ceiling light - the bowl lamp made of polished copper strips wrapped around the thinly dyed shells is lit up, in the air The ceiling forms a huge circular spot, and the insects attracted by the light fly around it, breaking through and casting a shadow that constantly changes position and shape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A green apple, golden almonds, citrus scent comes oncoming, Chiz. Sitting in front of the dressing table, in front of John Carson probably only One of the few uses of cosmetics can be guessed. The scent is emitted from a glass bottle containing a purple liquid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She doesn’t seem to be asleep, she is not wearing pajamas, her upper body is covered with a dark green tight vest, while the lower body is wearing a pair of shorts with the same color and high hair. The ground was tied up, hanging on the back, and the diffused tail flew like a gossamer under the force of the sea breeze - she pushed the chair open, stood up, and stepped back two steps. The mirror provided by the temporary residence was too small. She couldn't see her full picture from it - the girl carefully looked at herself in the mirror, about two or three seconds of work, she grabbed an orange balined coat hanging on the bed board and wrapped it quickly on her body. Suddenly taken off, tied to the waist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you think? John," she bluntly yelled at her father’s name like any child of the Western Confederation: "Will? Too bold? I mean... this color?” At the time of the consultation, she still stared at the image in the mirror, and kept twisting her waist. Turn left and turn right. The light-colored ponytail also jumped together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Very good." John said: "But can you stop for a while? Dear, I have to talk to you - very urgent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chez Carson turned around, the expression on her face meant that she was gradually precipitating from the illusion of fluttering, she took off the Bali yarn coat ,sit down. John approached it, and there was only a chair in front of the dresser in the room. He had to sit on the edge of the bed, and at least half a dozen clothes on the edge of the bed, almost all that Chiz brought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think you have to leave," said John Carson. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You invited me to be with you. In the last two weeks of the summer vacation." Chiz calmly pointed out: "What happened? Is it a mother?" Or is it a grandfather?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, no, they are safe and sound, nothing." John Carson’s voice is full of frustration: "I did it wrong." I shouldn't have invited you here. It's not a good place to go here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chiz’s eyes flashed for a while, she was guessing if her father found her The attempt - she is preparing to enthusiastically pursue a boy on the island of Poseidon - she immediately vetoed, John Carson has swept into the arms of the group since the arrival of here, those hard and soft beauty Let him forget everything, including his daughter. And out of my own little selfishness. Chiz didn't want to disturb him. Her mind was like a little girl who sneaked into the living room and watched the midnight theater with her parents sleeping. She was always very careful. She always carried her hand when she returned to the temporary residence. Things, not flowers, food, and occasionally small crafts. Let the old father who is busy with work think that she is fascinated by the small market on Poseidon Island... The person who can destroy this fragile illusion is not without, for example, she is always following her Miss Marion, she is Chitz's private music teacher. Is it Chiz’s care, or bodyguard? Chiz knows that she has undergone a lot of training, perhaps not very strong, but she can guarantee her escape or alert at the first moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Marian is a responsible person, but she has been with Chiz for too long. She has no children, so at some point she will be very indulgent to her little master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have to leave here." John stressed: "I can't explain it to you in too much - sorry. Chiz, the holiday is over, you have to go back." Go to your mother."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about you?" Chiz asked: "What about you, Dad?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John Carson suddenly lowered his head and silenced for about half a second. He looked up again and looked at Chiz. His eyebrows were wrinkled very tightly, suddenly relaxed, but his lips were stunned. Straight, thick fingers stirred and stirred. Even if Chiz doesn't have the sharpness of Hopkins's sharpness, it's easy to understand that the man is trying to get rid of the extreme hesitation and painful troubles. "No," he said weakly: 'No, I have to stay here for a while, not long,' he added as if to save something: "At most one week, Chiz, Beckon (Note 1) is in these days... and We," he said vaguely. "There is probably no next chance. That person is probably... I mean, he should be very angry. "John Carson muttered, and suddenly sighed loudly: "I have to finish my work," his spirit suddenly cheered up and seemed to see a good excuse: "So, I have to work, I can't help." Look after you, Chiz, I know that I let you down, but this is no way. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought you thought about this when you invited me," Chiz said slowly. "I am a big girl. I won't disturb you. I just stay on the island, just like before. I barely saw you for a few days, but everything looks fine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John Carson blushed, he knew he was He is guilty of old problems, just like the kindness, gentleness, and indecentness that he has in the Carson family. His stubbornness is also famous for his family. He drums up his courage and begins to prepare for the next rhetoric— - He is ready. If Chiz strongly disagrees, he will let his ex-wife send someone to take her away. Of course, this is not good, but John Carson never thought about taking her daughter as Bet to gamble on the "Tang" on Poseidon Island is not a real good man as local residents think. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You listen to me, Chiz... Oh, no, Wait a minute. Hehe..." John Carson, who is preparing to start the difficult confrontation again, can't even get up and even bite his tongue. "Wait, you said you... willing to go back?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes," Chiz said innocently, shrugging his thin shoulders: "I am willing to go back." She smiled at the doubtful father: "Although I don't understand why you didn't know how to tell me this way." The reason for doing it... But, yes, Dad, I am willing to listen to you. If necessary, I can go back in the night, as long as there is a boat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No It’s not that urgent.” John Carson was relieved. He stood up and went to Chiz, hands on his daughter's shoulders, and kissed her forehead cautiously: "Tomorrow. Non-local vessels are not allowed to sail in the vicinity," he looked at the pile of clothing: " You have to take a good sleep, then... I will come to help you pack things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am really sorry," he left before leaving the room. Such a sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He forgot to say "Good night." Chiz thought, she did not sleep immediately as required by John Carson. Instead, pull out the suitcase from the bottom of the bed and stuff all the clothes in a mess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought you would insist," I don't know when Marion appeared at the door, she was between thirty-five and forty, with short brown hair . She is a good and clean woman, she blinks at the girl: "For that."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many secrets between them that are tacit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you suggesting me to stay?" Chiz straightened up and put both hands in his waist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course... No. Dear," Marian said with a smile: "If you don't want to go home, I will stun you." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," Chiz continued to sort things out: "So, why should I violate what you mean?" She slouched the perfume into the box. The lid was not tightly closed and the perfume spilled out. The purple liquid immediately contaminated a white shirt. Chiz screamed and grabbed the bottle reflexively. The bottle was completely empty. She paused for three seconds and threw the bottle back into the box: "The world's largest The loss is caused by impulsiveness and willfulness - one of the trainings of the Carson family - but I can ask what is going on?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not very clear about the specifics," Marian said. "It seems that Mr. John Carson refused a transaction."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" ..." Chiz stopped the action. She thought about it for a while: "I understand, it seems that I really want to go. Please remind me to write a note to my father - he ruined my first love." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dangerous first love."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I asked for not much." Chiz said: "A sweet fantasy. Well, maybe a little exciting... but I really, really like him, that feeling will not be there anymore."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s like a beautiful shark swimming around.” Marian said: “Dear, fantasy and facts are often very different.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I don't think I will remember him until I am 80."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then you have to try to live to be 80 years old." Marian said: Try to return to the mainland and start the second beautiful relationship. Poseidon Island is not suitable for Romantik."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe I should not come from the beginning This."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
