			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same late night, Sasha heard the short shit and girl’s screams in his sleep, and he sat up from the bed, blanket Falling from his shoulders, the dark blue skylight penetrated through the gaps in the curtains, and the things in the room became blurred and softly contoured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door of the room door was slightly rotated a half turn, the door opened, and once Anthony Hopkins, now Mr. Streif stood at the door With his orange and yellow lights on the back, his face and half of his body were shrouded in the shadows. Only a pair of gray-blue eyes flashed in the darkness. "The uninvited guest," he said, "but it is not an accident. He listened to his ears, and the sounds of the dogs and people outside were getting bigger and bigger. If the house chosen by Mr. Streif was too remote, their movements might have awakened people in nearly half of the street: "I Going down, but I’m afraid things won’t end too soon.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha opened the lamp, his father approached him, leaned over and kissed the child’s forehead. Sasha discovered that Mr. Streif was well-dressed. He wore a dark-brown sheepskin high-necked coat with a leathery coat. It felt as soft as cotton silk when rubbed against the bare skin of Sasha. I went." The tall, thin male said softly, he turned back. Go, wrapped leggings boots leaving pale marks on the carpet, a sound was heard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can read the book," Mr. Streif suggested before the door was closed again: "Or look at something else, everything is free." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha sat on the bed, squinting, and there was a short collection of Chernoston on the bedside table, but since the father said so, he is more willing "Look at something else" - he immediately jumped out of bed, wrapped a small blanket on the bed frame, and walked to the window, the height of the window just allowed him to show his eyes - he saw his father appear On the grass, through the garden under the moonlight, into the dark woods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Streif paused at the edge of the woods, somehow The light-colored living creature squats under a lush lilac, and Straight, whose night is not damaging his vision, easily recognizes that it is one of the bull-headed stalks he keeps, its head is close to the ground. The limbs were curled under the body. When it was noticed that someone was approaching, it tried to raise its head. One side of the eye socket was bleeding from the outside, and the teeth were exposed with vigilance. Streif walked over. I flashed its teeth, checked it briefly and quickly, and found that the dog was not saved. One of its eyes was dug out of the whole, from two ribs to the groin, there were several abnormalities. The sag, no bones, can't help with the softness. He guessed that his stomach should be full of broken internal organs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stralyf hugged the stupid head of the bull terrier, slightly hard, and the dog’s head rotated upwards forty-five degrees under his powerful hand, giving a crisp Breaking sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good dog," he whispered, letting it continue to lie under the lilac, walking alone into the woods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The path in the woods is narrow and tortuous, and the trees next to the trails are tilted outwards. It is difficult to leave intermittent traces of moonlight through the dense foliage of summer. Like a twist, a dotted line drawn along the dotted line for about five minutes, you can see a small open space, empty space, except for an apple tree with only stumps left, history The dog group of the Treff family gathered here, and the targets of their siege were almost exhausted. After another white-haired black-eyed bull terrier was kicked out, its gray companion slammed around the root pile. Jumping with this height, like a fierce wolf, biting at the enemy's neck! It almost completely succeeded, and the other hand dexterously avoided the teeth of the back neck, but it could not be said to be a failure, because the teeth of the gray bull terrier caught the raised brown hair when they closed. The illegal intruder was suddenly pulled by the weight of nearly seventy pounds. Her body lost her balance, and she fell to the ground on her back. A piebald bull terrier rushed up and was accurately smashed out by her hard leather boots. Another pure white bull terrier saw the machine ran a small half circle and attacked from the back of her shoulder. She raised her arm in time. The teeth that should have bitten her neck fell on the arm, and she screamed painfully. In addition, the gray bull terrier is still swaying wildly - its teeth are stuck in the braided, extremely tight hair, and her head has to be dragged on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Save... save me!" she screamed and said, "Let them... get out!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Anne Kent." Mr. Streiff Say the name calmly: "At this time, it’s a bit strange to see you at this location. Now the good kids should sleep in bed." He licked his lips, and after a short whistle, the bull terriers The movements were stopped, but their teeth remained in their original position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne bit her lip, her eyes are hidden under the scattered hair, her eyes are poisonous, and her bare face is scarred, but not too serious. "Let your dog..." She snorted: "Let me go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Description," Mr. Streif said: "Although I can basically guess that... you shouldn't be coming for afternoon tea," he raised his fingers and bent them down one by one: "The time is wrong, the way is wrong, the mood is wrong, The intention is wrong, the clothes are wrong." The "Ghoul" sight swept over the girl's body. She was not so cute today, she wore a hooded overalls, a long-sleeved shirt, boots, and was caught by the dog. The backpack was open, and Streiff pulled an old razor from the inside and tried it on his finger. It was very sharp: "The gift is also poor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know what you are talking about...this is just an adventure, a night adventure...here all Children will come here to play!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When your foster mother is unconscious, your adoptive father must face two deformed children?" Mr. Fu disagreed: "Anne Kent, you should be with them now, comforting them with your sweetness and purity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the eyes of Anne The anger almost rushed out of the eye: "If you don't have it!" she shouted in her throat. "Of course it will! Of course!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"噢"Mr. Streif asked with great interest: "What have I done?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie closed her mouth tightly, white bull terrier swinging With a bit of her head, she screamed again in pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let me go...I will die..." she shouted eagerly: "If I am dead, you will...have trouble." He stared at the man in front of him: "You will have trouble!" She surely said: "You will have big troubles."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I miss you It was a person who came here, and no one told him, including the unlucky couple and Dolores or anyone else. It was very quiet, and the nearest neighbor was two kilometers away." Streiff Sit down on the stump: "There is only two kilometers from the riverbank state park. Of course, straight distance, I have been to the riverbank park more than once. There is a very beautiful wetland. Do you know what the wetland is right? You Has always been a diligent student, 'natural or artificial, permanent or temporary wetlands, wetlands, peatlands or waters, with or stationary or flowing, or fresh, brackish or salt water bodies, maybe you I have seen it with my own eyes. I will offer flowers for you, what do you like, lily or rose, Is it a little daisies?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl tried to bite her teeth, but failed, her upper and lower teeth couldn’t help but fight up, "You dare not "She weakly and weakly retorted: "If you leave a trace, you will be investigated, and you will be caught."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe," History Treff nodded slightly: "But you are dead."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
