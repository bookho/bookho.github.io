			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This squid is not bad. Try?" asked Besib. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main source of this small and elegant restaurant comes from the lovers of the teachers and students, the traditional design, the sea-blue wooden façade and the creamy sash The door and the beige ceiling have a small red sign at the door - one Michelin star, the table and chairs are simple in style, and the walls are decorated with large marine-themed oil paintings, each dish is fifty to one hundred. Around the yuan, mainly seafood. The raw squid of Besib points to the common practice of raw beef in French cuisine. It mainly uses raw beef mixed with egg yolk and pickled capers (a kind of green sour small fruit), which can be mixed with tomato sauce or hot sauce. With slender French fries to eat, this shop replaces raw beef with raw squid. The fish is more refreshing and sweeter than beef. Besib took a new spoon to the waiter, hot sauce and tomato. Sauce, rudely poured the seasoning on his plate, stirred it and then gave a spoonful to Sasha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You added too much hot sauce." Sasha said "I feel that I am not eating squid, but eating sauce."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry." Besib said absently, he frowned. It seems to be troubled by something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Besib suddenly became a bit more, he cares about the sugar content of the dessert, and has doubts about the freshness of the fruit, even the last Both the coffee and the ice cream were tasted differently by him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think this ice cream is salty," Besib said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think we will be driven out by the chef in the next minute." Sasha said, but he still ate a little bit of ice cream from Besib: "You salted up?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't." Besib said that an innocent little tentacle is quietly placing the salt shaker at the next table. Go back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pepe..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pepe called me this morning. He said that he got a few pounds of very good blue lobster and halibut. How do you think we have a private dinner?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is going to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You," Besib said: "Of course, if you don't mind, I can also take the handle. He said this way, while he was calm. Waiting for Sasha to answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not at the last time," Sasha replied as usual: "I am familiar with the new curriculum and professors, we can go to restaurants."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A few days ago you also made Saba to Brian Dupont," Besib said: "You can also make creamy lobster and fried halibut, as long as you can remember The amount of ingredients and sugar salt on the recipe -"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little Hopkins suddenly stopped, and he turned to look at Besib. The expression is not unexpected: "You found it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I guess for several years," Besib said: "At first I thought you were deliberate, thinking To make fun of us - but you did have a problem with the taste disorder, is it? This situation has been maintained for a while... you can't figure out what it's like to make, even if you can remember every recipe A detail. But what you eat in your mouth and the description on the book, and what you remember are different - you made adjustments and the result is that we were sinned." He shook his head. "So you reduced into the kitchen." The number of times, although you have always liked to cook - Brian DuPont does not know, he gave you a good job, this good job requires a keen tongue."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My tongue is still very sharp," Sasha said as he said to himself: "The disorder is my nerve." He nodded. "I originally wanted to choose me." Roommate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are aware of my anomaly. Besib said with dismay: "I have only discovered your problem until now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not good at this," Sasha said. This problem does not affect my daily life and even my life. I should throw it away when I eat something that should be very good, but I taste it strange. Sometimes it is not a thing to eat something that looks strange to others. The great sin of forgiveness - no one will notice this - except you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And Dr. Hopkins," Besib said. "He doesn't know how strange it is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey," Sasha admitted. "Really. But I think he is... well, pay attention to me. - I am trying to control it... that's it, this is the best. Besib."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Psychology and psychiatry for me It’s two strangers who can’t be strangers anymore,” Besib said. “But I know that delays don’t work for any problem. When did the chocolate roast leg appear? Damn it’s when we’ve just arrived When Rand - God. Sasha, you have a problem earlier than I am!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The incentives are different," Sasha said. "Our troubles originated in different places."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just want to see the results." Besib said: "Give me time, otherwise I Just go and ask a doctor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who else? Bessib said with a rogue: "Only One, trustworthy, capable, and able to suppress you - your father, Dr. Anthony Hopkins."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** *<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Hopkins is standing on the edge of the hall, behind him is a circular foyer, the entrance hall is connected to the entrance, and the end of the entrance is the gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red-red meat flows down from the three-story master bedroom, along the corridor, stairs, to the second floor and the first floor, covered with the living room, smoking Room, terrace and dining room, kitchen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They stop at about three feet from Anthony Hopkins, like a boiling pot, constantly popping their heads, bulging, Hey, it’s like discussing something – they don’t dare to move forward, like a group of frogs being blocked by a poisonous snake, but they don’t want to give up – there is a lot of meat, a lot of meat, a lot of food... ...they said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you finding Chegar?" Hopkins asked, looking up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am looking for." Old Andreana is sitting on the chandelier, her feet are countless tiny tentacles, they are scratching upwards, want to eat Go to that piece of meat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
