			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter 168, Las Vegas (5)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unbelievable good luck," murmured, his fingers gently rubbing against the edge of the top. He couldn’t help but do this when he was nervous or had trouble. This is not a good old problem. En. Battier reminded him many times. The lanterns on the top of the Mac are still spinning. Some gamblers stand up from behind the machine and look curiously. The coin outlet is still throwing out black chips, and twenty or thirty chips have overflowed the hopper. Falling on the carpet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened to him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A little trouble." Sasha turned his head Look around: "What do you think of that?" Besib looked down at his sight. It was a ruddy old man, just in their back row, the white curly roll curled from the red baseball cap. When I came out, my blue eyes widened, staring at the outlet of the coin that was constantly popping up. He saw Sasha and immediately gave a thumb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha waved at him, and the old man stunned his head in confusion, but he came over and he carefully walked around when he came over. The area of ​​the chip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How are you lucky today?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not good," he opened himself Pocket: "Fifty yuan, all right, I am getting ready to eat something."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not playing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man shrugged his shoulders: "I am just a tourist," he rubbed his eyes secretly at Sasha. "I put the casino on the last day and bought the return ticket." There are still four hours, I should go home." He looked at the cup full of black chips with a little envy: "I gave myself a quota and only brought fifty yuan in cash. If I win, I will go to eat a frozen crab in Alaska. If I lose it, I will have a hot dog. The hot dog here is also very good. The children, the amount is good, the taste is good, and the price is cheap.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think you still have the possibility to eat frozen crabs. Sasha said, he blinked: "Are you not pulling two Jack Treasures?" ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue eyes are bigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let us do a favor for each other." Sasha said, "I am not twenty-one years old." He made a small face, "also That is to say, less than the legal age at which they can enter the casino, the two Jack Casinos have the right not to cash me." He leaned over and grabbed a hand from the coin cup. There are about a dozen black chips: "I just need these - I originally just wanted to eat frozen crabs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old gentleman opened his mouth:" But..." The third time he glanced at the cup that could still be said to be full: "This, will the casino allow it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nobody found It can be.” Sasha said of course, although the deputy of the casino owner stood by him. And they have surveillance cameras on the top and bottom, left and right, but he knows that neither, nor Shane Battier will allow others to debunk this temporary scam. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Paradise Palace Casino has always been honest and trustworthy. Law-abiding, patrolling managers, dealers, dealers and even hospitality in the casino will pay attention to not allowing young men and women who look like twenty-one years old to approach any table, but the latter has the right to be in the casino. Wandering freely. The number of Macs that make up almost one-third of the casino's total revenue has always been amazing, and they are often arranged in groups. The tall machines can almost cover a person's tightness and bet simple. rapid. In addition to redeeming chips, no need for help from others - so in many cases, even if a manager sees a minor... well. What he is doing, he will also be invisible. Of course, he will inform other people that if the little guy is too hot, he will be "reminded". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha. Hopkins did not lie. There is indeed such a law in Las Vegas, where minors are guilty of gambling. Not only can he not take away the money he has won, he may also be fined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The initial hesitation was precisely because of this, he originally wanted to bring these two boys to play casually, I did not expect that they could pull two Jack Treasures. He was quite worried that Sasha Hopkins and Besib. Bissance insisted on taking the money they won. The two Jack treasures are about 3,500 yuan, which is completely inferior to Shawn. Battier gave the two-volume chip, but in the casino for a few years, I saw the ugly look of the wealthy guests who succumbed to a few black or red chips and even tempered their temper. One of the things, at the same time, the sudden flight of cooked ducks will also make them ignite more violent anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every guest who pulls Jack Jack will be registered by a special person. His name will appear in the most conspicuous place of the Mac. Some gamblers will come over and shake hands with them to seek good luck. There are photos if they are willing Their photos will be placed on the Paradise Palace casino site - although Sasha Hopkins and Besib. Bissau are taller and stronger than their peers, it is difficult to see between action and speech. The young people are uniquely violent and frivolous, but as long as they have eyes, they can tell that they are absolutely only two minors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other managers can be recruited to force them away as soon as possible. The problem is that this will undoubtedly anger the two boys. Then, what Mr. Shane Battier gave him was even messed up... at least half of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He now feels that he is more fortunate than the old man who was surprised by the big pie. Before he gave the solution, the boys have already All the problems were handled properly - under the insistence of the old gentleman, Besib also grabbed a chip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The end of the whole thing was very timely, because it was only a minute after Hopkins exchanged positions with Bissand and the lucky old man. In a little more time, a red hair that never felt comfortable was in their field of vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Red hair is too big", the eyes of the green eyes are opposite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Hopkins, I need your help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shawn Battier said: "Someone is unknowingly making money from my casino for seven months, every month. Loss of several million yuan, the first half of the shareholder dividend I had to pay money out of my pocket - you know, I can not let them know that the casino has such a big mistake - but this trick can only After playing once or twice, the loss is still going on, and they will be aware sooner or later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These cute little instruments have problems?" Hopkins Say. He lowered his head, and the screen under his feet was smug on his thin face: "I remember you have other methods - no matter which table, if you lose more than 100,000 pieces per month, you will Dismiss all relevant people and come back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have done this. I even changed more than three bankers on a table in these seven months. It's useless. I don't have any use at all." Shane Battier pointed to the desk with his toes. The previous screen: "Look at this table. Originally, it earned me 500,000 yuan a month, and the highest in January exceeded 1.2 million. But during this time, it only received a total of only Into the tens of thousands of chips."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, someone is looking for you trouble." Hopkins said: "I think you have tried Finding that person, I remember that everyone who can dig more than 10,000 yuan from Heaven Palace has a record."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," Xiao B. Battier: "Ivan Sergeyevich, an outsider."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A gangster." Hopkins stared at that The image of the fixed frame: "People call him the blue shoulder Ivan, his shoulder is pierced with sea blue and dark blue tattoo. I used to have a female patient, his affectionate wife, she has blue phobia But dear, the organization to which he belongs is far from here, and there is no doubt that there is still a distance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now it doesn't look so far away." En Battier spits out his tongue. This is a universal, scornful and disgusting action: "For two consecutive months, he wandered around in the Palace of Heaven. Roulette, blackjack, baccarat, scorpion... In addition to the Mac, his winning face was achieved. More than 60%, he used cash to exchange chips, then exchanged chips for cash, and finally deposited the cash into a secret private account."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How much?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Every day is around 200,000 yuan. I guess he is laundering."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You stare at him?" Hopkins twisted his finger: "He really didn't play any tricks? I mean - cheating? I mean, camera, laptop, etc. Now the technology Can make an ordinary person become a true Mercury (in Roman mythology, he was the son of Jupiter and the goddess Maia, serving as the messenger and interpreter of the gods, and also animal husbandry, business, The god of transportation tourism and sports, or the god worshipped by thieves. It is hereby referred to as the god of gambling)"< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I sent someone to check," Sean said with a gloomy look: "I have people who are struggling with the touch of electronic devices." The instrument was close to him, no, nothing, I also searched his luggage, installed a hidden monitoring probe in his bathroom, and found two beautiful women to cover his words."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He found it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Found," Sean Battier replied unsatisfactorily: "The next day he won 540,000. Yuan, when redeeming cash, he stripped his clothes in front of everyone and then peeed on the chips."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What a pity, Las Vegas The law of Sri Lanka has never forbidden to expose the body in public, and to pee on the chips.” Hopkins sympathetically took out a box of small-diameter cigars from his pocket: “A mixture of Ecuador and Honduras, Sean, It tastes light."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It also has a peppery flavor and a minty flavor," Battier said. "You are really a stubborn guy, I remember you. The first cigar I asked was this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not the best, but the most suitable for me, and my favorite, then There is no need to change anything.” The ghoul said slowly: “So, let's talk, dear Battier, what do you want me to do?” He turned The cigar between the fingers allows Battier to ignite the match evenly: "Stop Ivan? No, no, no, no, no one, no one, I know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't kill him directly," Sean Battier said. "He's not a person who sneak a sneak peek. Every day someone sends him money. He has six beside him, or Eight guards. I tried to remind the director of Las Vegas that there is a gang of gangsters in the eastern region who are laundering money through gambling..." He shrugged: "He is quiet like being manipulated. The head of the cockroach (child.) He took a deep brown cigar.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So..." Hopkins pointed to the ceiling: " Didn't they move?” He refers to the local gang who dominates Las Vegas.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I don’t know if they’re aware of it,” Xiao En Battier said: "I don't want them to know that before I catch the tail of the blue shoulder Ivan, the money I lose will only let them first. I am off, then Ivan." He was silent for a while: "I feel that someone wants to kill me, not just outside, but also inside, I have to dig out the nails that are tied."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So what do you want to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to find someone," Sean Bar Til said bluntly: "A smart and dexterous person can help me win back the money. He can draw one tenth from it in return. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
