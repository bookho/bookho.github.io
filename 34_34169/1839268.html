			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the room of Shane Battier, the room has not been restored, the display that was previously inlaid and suspended from the ceiling, walls, and ground is destroyed. Quite thoroughly, the residual metal body twisted and protruded into the air with sharp tentacles. The slag of the glass shimmered in the dark corners, and the ostrich leather shoes stepped on them. They were dissatisfied under the tough soles. Awkward voices - Several of the most trusted subordinates walked around the room, carefully searching for any clues that might be caught, and their guns had opened the insurance card slot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shawn’s desk tilted forward, the sleek skin of the behemoth has been completely uncovered, and only four harp arms can keep a little The traces of the past, a table leg can even be said to be very good, even with the smoke and wires in the burning of the slabs, the lining of the lion's claw-shaped table legs and the inside of the curved legs are clearly visible. The table is not so lucky to enhance the old-fashioned and artificially added scars - the planks that cover the outside of the steel plate are smashed, the center of the steel plate is blown open by an ugly hole, and the folds at the edge of the hole are hard to believe. It's made from a piece of metal – it looks like a chocolate wrapper that was thrown away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember to put the ice bucket in that position - the ice bucket is filled with ice water and ice, and a bottle of sparkling wine, under the wine A small detonating device is connected to a pack of liquid mixed explosives. As soon as someone picks up the bottle, the detonating device will detonate the drug. When sending small sandwiches, caviar and this bottle of hidden smoky sparkling wine into the room, the most worrying thing is that Shane Battier will invite him to stay for a drink, or before he leaves the room. The over-exposed red hair Judah picked up the bottle, but fortunately neither of these happened - the problem is that the person he wants to deal with has also disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. It disappeared, there was no blood, no brains, no flesh, bones or fragments of clothes. They were like beautiful girls in the magic cupboard. They waved their hands and whistle and disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blast of the air rushed out of the room, frantically tearing the chandeliers on the corridor and the paintings on the walls. When the carpet was gone, it was less than five minutes away from the room. Sean Battier's quirky, sturdy room has only one door, no window, and the walls, ceiling, and floor are all filled with monitors connected to the monitor. For him to monitor the situation in the entire casino anytime, anywhere - there is only one corridor and an elevator outside the door, filled with people. At least twelve pairs of eyes stared at the door—no one was over there after coming out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought that there was a dark passage or a secret room that he didn't know in the room, but it turned out to be counterproductive. They searched the entire room within a few minutes. I couldn't even find a hair from Shane Battier or Judas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Continue?" asked one of the subordinates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." He said that his fingers involuntarily licked the jacket hem, and Battier once laughed and warned him that it was an easy exposure to inner activity. The little tricks are like a dog shaking his tail when he is excited, but he can't change it: "We have more important things to do... It doesn't matter. There is always a way to find them - no matter where they were hiding before Only in the toilet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The toilet?" The girl said her voice High and sharp: "What are we? Feces?" She sneered nervously. "That's really good. It's stinky, bad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Lila." "Head" cast a warning glimpse, the girl called Lila lowered her voice, but the purple black mouth was stubbornly upturned, bad makeup technique. Judas thought that the girl's eyeshadow was blue. The thick one is like two punches that have been beaten by people. The shadow of the nose is too heavy, and the nose is narrow and pointed. The eyebrows of the fixed color setting cream are exaggerated and inserted directly into the fluffy curly black hair. She looks at it. It’s like a little witch in a fairy tale book – maybe it’s just that she saved the lives of Judah and Shane Battier, and she took them through the wall – the shock waves that followed the explosion Their heels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They not only passed through a wall, but after the initial horror, Judah was squinting and was taken through several rooms after... That kind of feeling is difficult to describe. If you want to give an example, Judas can only say that it is quite similar to falling into the quicksand. He was cheated by the neighbor’s big child when he was very young. He cried again. Calling, and they only laughed and applauded on the side - he didn't remember much afterwards. In the end, the clearest memory was the moment when he was asked by the collar to ask for quicksand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a wonderful thing to live. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judas fell in the chair, he felt like he was hit by a few punches, and Shane Battier’s situation was worse than him, his face was pale He refused the help of Judah, lying on his back on the ground, breathing for a while, finally smoothing his breathing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If the speed slows down, they will feel better," Lila said. "But you know," she shrugged her shoulders. "At that time, there was no way... um, I mean, it’s slow, it’s going to kill people." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Head" does not matter, nodded, as long as people are still alive, and there is no hard-to-health injury, it is really uncomfortable - Li The ability to pull is still very useful, not to mention that she is only thirteen years old this year - the ability of the abilities will change, expand and enhance over time, which has been confirmed, she will be stronger and more special in the future, More perfect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, old man, you cover me." Lila said that she kicked Battier without any politeness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can find this room, he will be surprised that this room is similar to the original room of Shane Battier, where the six faces are also full The display connected to the monitoring probe, Heaven Palace (including the original room of Battier), and every inch of the "Tianqiu" and even those cute little houses named after the heavens. Can be found on one of the screens, Shane Battier covered the "Tianqiu" Baccarat table, he raised his eyelids and glanced, the girl's calf wrapped in a black flash, deliberately There are a lot of big and small holes, so that people can see things inside. Her shoes have a high and thick heel. White, let Battier think of the things that the ladies in the oriental movie showed under the gorgeous robes, the small stilts made of wood, slamming on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a male-only tolerance of the little girl of this age, Battier turned over and let the seat sit up, So that this wayward little witch can see what she wants to see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is this stuff?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lilla makes an expression that wants to vomit And posture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The things on the screen look... It’s easy to reminiscent of the stomach, a group of living, out of the cavity and esophagus, intestines. Soft meat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins who took the pistol seems to have lost the gun With the interest of his own head, he directed directly at Ivan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivan’s evasion was faster than bullets, and he also pulled down his black-haired female companion. Almost as fast as a bullet, he was standing behind Hopkins, Catherine, and the two boys. They did not hesitate to shoot. The anti-sit was transmitted from the gun to the wrist and arm. They thought they were immediately You can hear the screams of pain, just like every time in the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flesh-colored film was pulled out and opened from Besib's feet, and it was exactly behind the Hopkins father and son and Catherine. The bullets were shot into the flesh and immediately wrapped up. The meat is creeping, like chewing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What should I do?" Besib said: "I hate bullets."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Just spit it out." Sasha said that his fingers are still tied with Besib, and the small and uniform flow of light flows from this end to the other side. The trust of Besib allows Sasha to partially use his body and ability. . The flesh-colored film swayed, because the bullets that were severely deformed when they encountered obstacles at high speeds were exposed and dense. It is like peppercorns on chicken chops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha said that when he spit it out, there were only two people. No, three people responded as they should. Ivan caught him. Brunette female companion. Rolled back behind a pillar, while Catherine and Big Hopkins wanted to move. The film that was originally behind them suddenly rolled up from the back to the front, and they were wrapped inside and the lines were not visible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine couldn’t move and couldn’t see anything, but she could still breathe – the film pressed against her skin, it had temperature, It also has a slight pulsation, and Catherine feels that it is not as big as it looks - it is a strip, and it will relax and tighten in turn when it is creeping, just like the muscles of human beings. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After somewhere from Catherine’s “Face”, it suddenly tightened. It paused for a second or two and suddenly relaxed – absorbed by the muscles. The bullets were ejected, and the closest to them was the first to suffer. The deformed bullets were more harmful to the human body at the same speed, and several of them were torn to the face and throat. The chest splits open. After they fall down, it is the turn of the gambler who is too slow to make his mind because of his age or alcohol. Fortunately, the bullets of Besib’s "body" are not much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
