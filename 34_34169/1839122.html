			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a sunny, warm air in the courtyard, and the water in the copper basin is warmed by the sun. The various kinds of vegetation are exuding their unique smell, Anthony Hopkins stood on the porch for a while, letting the former Sasha wave his fat little arm and ran from his memory - now Sasha sits on a lounge chair in the middle of the courtyard, the recliner is It was flat, the child rested his neck on the headrest of the recliner, and the wet head was suspended in the air; Mr. Hopkins had already washed his head with alkali-containing soap to remove the grease and dust attached to the hair. So that the next steps are simpler and faster... Since leaving the ghost place, Hopkins has dyed Sasha's striking bright golden curls into bright brown, which is also very beautiful. But it is very soft and universal, not as dazzling as the former, so that everyone who has seen him is impressed and unforgettable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins is completely uninterested in hair dyes that are common in supermarkets and hairdressing stores, and whose main materials are full of chemical venoms and preservatives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He got a few pounds of high-quality coffee that was deep-baked, ground them into powder, cooked by siphoning, and extracted a dark brown gold solution... You see, the stubbornness of coffee has caused headaches for tens of millions of people, no matter what, teeth, leather, cloth, plastic... as long as it is stained, it can basically be declared scrapped or worn for life. Regular dark plaques (if you don't mind), human hair is no exception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coffee that stood still to the lukewarm was carefully poured over the small head of Sasha, and Hopkins’s slender fingers pierced into the curled hair. Let coffee penetrate into every gap as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the months of the father and son respectively, Sasha’s height has increased and his weight has dropped sharply. Hopkins has been trying this quarter. Let him return to the proper state of health, but until today, Sasha's weight has not been able to meet normal requirements, Anthony Hopkins watched the child grab the arm on both sides of the recliner... The child's arm is always cute Round, white, and tender, the doctor’s mind also has almost the same arm, sun, copper pot, eggplant... snow and blood-stained stakes, blonde hair and falling black The deciduous teeth on the land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Hopkins suddenly stopped moving, the shadows shrouded up, and Sasha reacted quickly because the previous sun was too strong and closed. s eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After thorough opening, the child’s eyes immediately reflected a pair of pocket-sized Anthony Hopkins – the eyes are still so clear and bright, though The special purple iris is getting deeper day by day, and now it seems to be a bit biased towards the ochre - the most convenient thing to cover the color of the iris is the soft recessive colored lens, which is used by many actors and modern characters. , but Sasha is too small. Soft recessive lenses are a very dangerous thing for children's undeveloped corneas. Anthony Hopkins certainly won't use this kind of thing for Sasha. He Inspired by an eye drop for the treatment of glaucoma and high intraocular pressure (this syrup causes rapid deposition of melanin in the iris), he extracts the part that is useful to him, and it is a pity. This effect is not long-lasting, just like the bright brown hair color of coffee, it has to be added every few days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to these two places, the body that may cause attention to others in Sasha is only the lightning striking pattern of an inverted leafless tree. The lightning strikes will disappear within twenty-four hours, and the lightning strikes on the sands will continue to fade for a few months, and as long as the temperature of the sands rises, his body will still have a light red branch mark. - Just like now, Mr. Hopkins can see that part of the skin on the edge of Sasha's cheeks is changing color, and it is almost as visible as the shape, strips, like the stripes that the Indians painted on their faces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sasha?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun is falling on the face, part of the skin has begun to have a burning sensation, Sasha paused, stretched out his hand and grabbed A gray shirt that has been warmed by the radiant light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I am," he said softly, father: "I have been there all the time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Welcome to St. Thomas."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;very convenient Sasha thought that his father was familiar with his future work environment, and he was familiar with the future learning environment. This is a private church primary school with fewer than 500 students and a total of 30 classes. Each class The number is no more than 20, and the teacher is one in each class, responsible for all subjects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a guide for each of them. The guide of Anthony Hopkins is a teacher of the fourth grade in the third grade, a younger and middle-aged Man, sturdy, pale yellow hair (the forehead is a little bald, he combs a hair across the hair, let it cover the exposed skin), the sound is loud, the face is rosy, the fingers are like the red sausage, but The overall look is amiable – he is also a member of the National Association of Teachers and Parents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha's guide Anne is more lovely - according to Hopkins' future colleagues, she is in the third grade here, and is about to enter the fourth grade. In other words, ten years old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brown hair curled into a large braid, hanging down to the waist, with a white bow with a side, a wide hem, and a jacket with a small coat. Milky skin, rosy lips, eyes with the same color as the hair will show an amber-like golden brown under the fluorescent light, talking like a triangle of iron that constantly makes a beautiful vibrato under the metal rod. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The children are walking in front, the adults are walking behind, now it is 4:1 pm, St. Thomas Primary School, the first class at 9 am, three in the afternoon After school, the classrooms and corridors are empty, visitors can see, listen and touch all the things of interest - the creamy yellow-colored corridors are hanging on the walls of the children's paintings, mostly religious subjects, one The image of the Madonna, which is half an adult's size, is adorned with colored cloth and caught the attention of Sasha. He stopped in front of the portrait and looked up to appreciate it. Annie stood by his side, neither urging, nor? 艋蛘呤 庞 庞 庞 鸬氖 饕 饕 饕 饕 饕 饕 饕 錾 錾 錾 ? ? 芏啾 芏啾 芏啾 芏啾 芏啾 芏啾 芏啾 芏啾 芏啾 ぷ鞯暮 ぷ鞯暮 ぷ鞯暮 ぷ鞯暮 ぷ鞯暮 ぷ鞯暮 ぷ鞯暮 ぷ鞯暮Hey? ?? wall 胍 胍 龊茫 龊茫 赐 赐 赐 龅 龅 龅 龅 > > > 孩子 孩子 孩子 孩子 孩子 孩子 孩子 孩子 孩子 孩子 孩子 孩子 孩子 孩子 孩子 孩子 孩子 孩子 孩子 孩子 孩子 孩子 孩子 孩子 孩子 孩子 孩子 孩子 孩子 孩子 孩子 孩子 孩子 孩子 孩子 孩子 孩子 孩子 孩子The shape of the sand is more familiar, and after a few seconds, he grabs the twitching corner of his mouth and shifts his gaze... It is a toilet gasket cover, cut a small half of the toilet gasket cover... although its golden color Very beautiful, without a trace of stains and creases, but it is really a toilet seat cover. Sasha stared at Mr. Humbert, who was very happy with his father, and couldn’t confirm whether the man was aware of it. He turned back and moved his eyes to the lower right corner of the portrait, where the author’s The name, the capital of the Dolores, Dolores. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dolores is my sister." The little girl is proud to say: "You can see her today."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, that’s great.” Sasha said, he moved away from the portrait and asked Annie to take him on the dark green carpet with small flowers. The classroom was close. There is a horizontal sign hanging like a hotel or a station. The sign reads the grade and class, and the full name of the teacher in charge of the class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Will your father's name be written here in the future?" Annie whispered, her eyes sparkling with curiosity: "He will be in charge of the class? Three grades in the fourth grade? I hope this class, Sasha, I Like you, like your father, he looks great, and you are very beautiful, very smart."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha looked at her, first discovered As the father said, human beings are things that are difficult to grasp... "Thank you," he responded dryly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little girl’s smile increased. She gently took the three fingers of Sasha and took him into a classroom with a Winnie the Pooh at the door: “This is Our classroom, but after September we will move to the next door.” She said, with Sasha passing through the orange tables and chairs, “teaching activity development area, math area, computer area, reading area and exhibition area, Sinks, storage cabinets, natural science pet area, natural science reading study area (computer 2)...a separate washroom." She took Sasha along the classroom and walked a little bit in the speech. I also have a few pity, and I am tired of introducing him to everything, whether standing or lying, sticking or hanging, lifeless and living (the natural science pet area has small plants and Turtles, hamsters and rabbits)... It’s a pity that Sasha hasn’t been able to listen to it at all – the third-grade classrooms are too much for the early-children who are used to adult tastes, the colors are too colorful, the form is also Too lively...he feels a bit Halo, I want to vomit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey...you don't look too good." Annie said seriously, she let Sasha sit down: "The teacher's office area has a water dispenser, you wait. A little while.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little girl ran over, the teacher’s office area was just a small piece of space separated by screens in this large area. Anila opened the screen, and Sasha saw the water dispenser, saw the blackboard next to the water dispenser, a solid dot drawn with chalk on the blackboard, and a little girl who put the tip of the nose against the dot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne looks a bit surprised: "Dolores?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Portrait of the Virgin of the toilet ring The author, Sasha suddenly felt that it was not so sad, he slightly widened his eyes, and intently observed the exquisite future artist of this ideological avant-garde. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dolores should be a girl, but dressed like a rough boy, the skin is much darker than Anne, and looks rougher. The black hair everywhere is shorter than the sand, the freckles on both sides of the nose, the face is round, she is a lovely child, but because of the comparison of Anne standing nearby, it naturally seems inferior, and because Sasha's look and embarrassing situation, her expression and eyes became more fierce and embarrassing than before... Before Sasha turned her head, the thick red had spread from her face to the light brown ears and collarbone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get him out!" Her nose was still fixed in the dot covered with chalk dust, but it did not prevent her from screaming, "You It’s a real bastard, Anne, you deliberately take someone else to see my joke!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I don’t know if you are here... I don’t even know you are doing it again. What's up!?" Annie raised her voice and shouted: "Can you not be stable for half an hour?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know now, put that little mixed ball Take away!” The girl continued to scream, and she carefully kept her body still – at least not letting her nose move: “Before I stepped on him!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course, we ban corporal punishment students here," Mr. Humbert said, his two thumbs in his trouser pocket: "But they can be punished, and children may chat during class or extracurricular activities. Quarreling, or calling, you may not listen to your arrangement. At that time, you have this right, you can let them develop during the game, understand? Others play, and they can only 'hewall( Standing on the wall)", watching the other people play, they can't move..." He blinked at Hopkins: "Have you ever been a teacher? If you have done it, you will understand that we are here. There is a request." He took two steps and stood on the side of the wall. The heel was next to the wooden baseboard: "Look at it, so that it can be called onthewall. Nothing else will work, and it will not pass." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Very image." Anthony Hopkins agreed: "hewall (a picture hanging on the wall), yes, cute, maybe In the beginning, the teachers were taking the children. Hanging on the wall."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henbott imagined in his mind--a row of mischievous children were hung on the wall neatly... Different poses and similar expressions: "Miao Wow, this is really wonderful," he said. "Maybe I should present this motion at the National Education Conference. We can prepare a few special bib pants and a solid wall. There is also a dozen strong hooks." He picked up Hopkins's thick, short eyebrows and determined that he didn't see the disapproval in the dark blue eyes: "Yes, Sterling." Mr. Leif," he shrugged his shoulders. "The 19 districts prohibit corporal punishment. But now more than half of the country's districts still allow corporal punishment. I am a member of the 19th district. I must follow the education laws of this district, but I agree with the right amount. There is a degree of corporal punishment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Snapped with short wooden paddles, the husbands of the 19th century often cooked their disrespectful wife."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s true, the Tatifa half that is now recognized is this, but I think the whip Better, as Rousseau wrote in the admonition, 'A little girl wants a pink sash and they give her a white sash, so she makes a big noise.” Mr. Humbert relished eagerly. Pick it up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dad heard in the living room<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caroline is making loud noises,<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then immediately rushed to her,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has not whipping her.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And, when Mr. Fairchild saw his child quarreling, he read the verse "Let the dog scream and bite happily" while hitting them with the scepter . He repeated with satisfaction: "You can't all deny,,,... there are so many laws that let the children do whatever they want. They are becoming arrogant, selfish and arrogant... constantly using their little cleverness." It’s not a good sign to deal with their educators and caregivers, Mr. Streif, I think, at least for us, you can be stricter, as one of the responsible persons here, I can guarantee that you have this Rights - Occasionally, I think parents will understand. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't matter if you take them to see hell? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...What? Mr. Humbert didn’t seem to understand what he had heard for a moment. He thought for a minute with his eyes open, and he didn’t smile so heartily: “Great sense of humor, sir, you have a very good Joke Cell - Are you referring to what Mr. Fairchild is doing behind? He took two boys to see a string of corpses hanging on a gallows with chains. ‘The chain creaked in the wind, the little boy was afraid, and begged to take him home. But Mr. Fairchild forced him to watch it for a long time, saying that this scene shows the end of those who are not well-behaved. The child is destined to be a pastor, so he must be taught to vividly describe the horrors of those who are punished too. 'Yes, yes, I don't deny that this kind of punishment is very suitable for children who don't change their minds and are willful. But now, dear, you don't always have to apply for a death penalty card - gas chamber and electric chair room Not a natural museum, maybe you can take them to see the martyrs monument - but I am afraid that they will be more excited because of this... Ha...ha, ha, ha..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
