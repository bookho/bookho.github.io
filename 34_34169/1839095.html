			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sergeant Aaron happily introduces Mrs. Alan and Catherine to the new wine he has tasted. Mrs. Alan readily accepts his hospitality, and Catherine feels a little uncomfortable. Because Sergeant Aaron reminded her of Jack – both men have a beautiful tooth that is enough for Hollywood dentists to be willing to put 10,000 pieces to advertise. She once again told herself that Jack would be safe and sound, maybe in the office at the top of the twenty-four-story building in the neighboring state of the "institution", drinking coffee from the floor-to-ceiling glass, licking his butt and using the telescope to admire the big chest on the street below. The beauty is like what I saw in his partner's five months. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white teeth of the early summer sun shine, they have moved from the wine to the olive oil, each of them from the fresh bread provided by the stall owner Tear a small piece, press a small groove on it with your thumb, then pour a little olive oil on it, and now stretch out your nose and sniff deeply to reveal the intoxicating look that makes the stall owner happy, then poke out the tongue bird So small and a little bit of a small spoonful of spicy aromatic oil, like a wine tasting in the throat for a few laps, and finally put the bread garnished with olive oil into the mouth, and lick your own Fingers - The whole process is like a sacred ritual or agenda. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine felt so stupid, and she was not used to drinking olive oil directly, no matter how good it was in food magazines and recipes, she felt it It’s better to mix it in salads or to make sauces, but she also understands that it’s better to live in a small town that has been closed for hundreds of years and may continue to be closed in the future. The hands and the smart mind, a closed mouth and obedient attitude is more important, not to mention that this is not a very important thing, just drinking olive oil, not sulfuric acid. Although the weight is amazing, Catherine looked painfully at the bottle from the pale emerald green to the transparent golden ochre liquid oil. She estimated that after the meal, her belt had to move a hole backwards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared to the absent-minded Catherine, Mrs. Alan and Sergeant Aaron are a happy, happy, and tasted and appreciating of more than a dozen olives. After the oil, because the sheriff enthusiastically offered to help Mrs. Alan to bring some heavier goods back, Mrs. Alan temporarily decided to buy about four gallons of pure olive oil from Andalusia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three men walked back along the rows of retractable tables, and Mrs. Alan also stuffed a lot of bread and long loaf into her basket. Hard bran bread, as well as a hot small cross buns, is a rough bun, with a small cross made of white sugar: "This kid has a good taste." She put the bread in the basket, then Put a little bit of perilla sugar and dried lemon inside. Catherine had a weak smile on this. Obviously, this was brought to Sasha. Although Sasha was only a little boy, she was inclined to adult in the aspect of snacks. The original chocolate candy canes in the store and many He has never looked at the taste of sugar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha’s way of getting Mrs. Alan’s heart is very simple, but it’s hard to imitate – she can’t fluently and fluently read and write the whole book like Sasha Bible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Supervisory sect, Catherine twisted her lips in her heart, but she had to admit that this is indeed the fastest way to get into this town, for these daily I must pray three times, one week to do a week, to receive a holy communion, to go to the confession room for an hour. For the honest believer, a child who knows the whole Bible at the age of 6 is simply a little angel given by God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sergeant Aaron also bought some roses and lettuce, as well as the beef chops that boys like, as a gift for a visitor, because Mrs. Alan is accepting him. When I was helping, I also made an invitation for lunch. This is often a problem. As a poor bachelor, in addition to the cafe, Sergeant Aaron can't find a suitable fixed place to eat in this small town. Fortunately, as far as Catherine sees, his popularity is still Not bad, the townspeople often ask him to help with the work, and then ask him to sit down for lunch or dinner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Alan made the most invitations. Catherine was maliciously speculating on her motives. In any case, Sergeant Aaron was a charming man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha does not know that he has earned a title of such glory He is sitting on his legs and sitting in a small bed converted from an old manger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no wireless network here, Catherine does not allow him to pass his own private account (that is, the kind of thing that can be used to withdraw cash or pay by simply checking the account number and password.) ) The computer and CD-ROM were purchased, and the only place where the Internet was available was the private residence of the sheriff. His contact with the outside world was temporarily cut off. He had to read the newspapers from the cafes in the town, but unfortunately those newspapers filled with funeral supplies, big clearances or the transfer of a mongrel dog that could sniff 300 kilograms of truffles in one winter would make it difficult for him to find What useful information is available. If he still wants something that rivals the past, it’s probably only reading. There is a Sunday school in this town, only a dozen students, but there is still a library. He made a small performance for the principal of the primary school - recite the whole Bible and get a book there. And the qualification to borrow books, of course, can not be broken or lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, this library is quite comparable to Sasha... childish and clean. But better than nothing, Sasha looked up and looked at the sunlight from the small window in the attic and sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know if God or the devil feels that such a life really needs a little compensation/punishment, and it’s hard to find it in Sasha’s head again. Before the book that did not cause the brain cells to degrade rapidly, the door of the attic was suddenly knocked open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sasha," No inquiry, no knocking on the door, a little boy with a wet red hair rushed into the room, like an excited puppy: " Hurry up, my mother is back!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha was almost dragged by him, from the corridor to the stairs, Sasha remained consistently quiet along the way, listening The boy said something: "Bring back a lot of delicious... Oh, we have to hurry down, or Tom and Jane will eat all the things they can find... I am saying, Not only my mother but also your mother... and Aaron Sheriff, he wants to have dinner here... No, there is lunch... We go swimming together in the afternoon... You always read, yes,” The boy used his fingers to slam the ever-declining forehead rudely: "What book are you reading? Interesting?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost guess his next sentence is Sasha, who lends me a look, shrugged: "Snow White."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boy Immediately, the face showed an unbearable expression, like seeing a truffle omelette caught in a steaming shit: "That is a book for girls." His voice sounds like it will always be Vomiting out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha smiled a bit. He didn't say the full title. The title of the book is "Snow White Post", the most important work of American literary master Barthelme. The whole book is full of the feeling of oppression, the sense of desolateness and jealousy of a woman who is indulging in housework. She always wants to make a difference, dreaming in a fairy tale that is incompatible with real life day by day, eager to be noticed. Or simply come to the adventure of a sex scandal, and the seven dwarfs have no sense of responsibility, compassion, and indifference to the problems in reality, they are eager for Snow White’s emotions and body, but they are not willing to Make even a little bit of really useful effort... It is hailed as a classic of postmodernism, black humor, and absurd literature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of Anthony Hopkins's children, this book cannot be said to be very good. In any case, the analysis of human nature is not profound enough, the thoughts are not detailed enough, and the physiological descriptions are lacking, even if it is simply As an entertainment, its content and writing are also inferior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at least one book, when Sasha turned to the book in the library, its cover was very worn, but the inside page was still very new, Imagine that the administrator of the library just bought it directly by looking at its harmless name and pure cover. It didn't turn over even a page, and later borrowers were too young for other reasons. I understand that this book has been returned directly after two pages, so this book can be saved fortunately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two boys ran into the kitchen one after the other, and sure enough, the two older boys were already eating tomatoes, cheese and sweets there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha asked Mrs. Alan and Sergeant Aaron, thank you, and then dried the dried basil with lemon and lemon. The cockroaches spread out and invited the boys to share - they tasted the really good sage and lemon dried, and they frowned and spit out their tongues, and cast incredible eyes on Sasha... How could he Do you like to eat that kind of stuff? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, as we said before, a meal consisting of cream radish, pepper sausage, squid olive bread, chilled red wine and white wine, and a large After a hearty lunch with a spoonful of homemade melon sauce, Sergeant Aaron went to the lavender field to work, except for the children outside Sasha to go swimming, while Mrs. Catherine and Mrs. Alan were busy sorting out what they bought today in the kitchen. And stored properly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha spent an afternoon reading the whole book, some of which made him feel a toothache. He went down to the attic and went to the kitchen to find Catherine to see if there was any What can make him forget something in this book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Alan is not in the kitchen, only Catherine and Aaron Sheriff in the kitchen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The children of Mrs. Alan are back, now she is supervising them upstairs and taking a good shower." Catherine smashed the blues to Sasha. Eyes: "Maybe you are willing to help me sort out the tableware?" It was a large drawer that was cleaned, but there was no silverware in the collection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha sat down slowly on the bench in front of the table, took off his hat, and only the shirt of Aaron Sergeant put the last bunch of fresh The lavender is tied up and stacked in the corner of the kitchen. This is the order that will be taken by the guests tomorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went to the kitchen sink to wash his hands and watched the six-year-old, cute and beautiful child as slow and accurate as the adult adults. With all kinds of tableware, I don't hide the vivid curiosity and estimation in my eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you like the circus?" Quiet for a few minutes, this is not very much like the sheriff's sheriff provoked a speech. In fact, his choice is not a big mistake. An ordinary child will definitely be ecstatic because of a circus that will pass through the town and will stay here and perform for a week. The problem is for Sasha, the lion, the tiger, Horses, etc., and even any kind of fierce bird and beast can hardly arouse his interest, and will there be a better animal trainer in the world than him? His orders can even make animals violate their nature and instinct when necessary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So...sorry, for the enthusiastic recommendation of the sheriff, Sasha can’t pretend to have the desired desire, he can only politely give it intermittent Nod, smile, to show that he is listening and thank him for his introduction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
