Besib said thoughtfully: "Or more precise, this fish is fundamentally It’s not being caught, but jumping on the boat.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“If that’s not really happy,” he added: “That’s Big Shark.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It’s okay,” Dr. Hopkins said happily. “Properly handled, sharks are as delicious.”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to the villa, the two boys were told to drink a cup of hot milk and went to sleep. Hopkins had something to say to them tomorrow morning, Catherine had already returned to her room, Hope Kings prepared a cup of green absinthe for himself. He sipped a cold liquid with a metallic smell and made a call to Shane Battier. Today's progress is beyond the expectations of the casino owner. In his vision, Ivan Sergeyevich would have observed the last two or three days before approaching Hopkins, during which Hopkins managed to It has become delicious enough to make Ivan lose the vigilance and suspicion as a senior member of the northern gang as soon as possible - they carefully analyzed Ivan's character, he is a stingy, greedy, ambiguous, lack of morality With the humanity of the next thing, the waiters of Paradise Palace call him a miser. He never gives a tip even if he wins the money. If he loses, he will look for a woman who plays a "fake gambler" or The barmaids blew the fire because they didn’t want money. After they enjoyed the game, they didn’t forget to make them into pigs. He often invited some people who would never even drop a word in the casino. "Friends" went to the casino's high-end restaurant for overeating (these are free), and forced the casino to open a shopping mall to give gifts, shirts, belts, tie clips... he has everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He not only wins the money in the casino, but also wins the money of the gambler. In this respect, he has a faction that is almost exactly the opposite of his nature - he If you don't pick those stupid ones, you will know that it is the first time you come to Las Vegas to try your luck. He prefers those who have similar identities. The brain is clever, the guy with a quick hand and foot, he even played a Russian roulette with a local gang member - the way is a bit special, Ivan took out a total of thirteen revolvers, each with a pistol The bullets were rotated by a special person, and then they picked one from the inside - no one died, but the local gangster spent a lot of money to keep Ivan in the mouth, and now the gang members are not like the past Impulsively militant, but it is quite inappropriate to let people know that they are afraid of death in front of an arguably enemy. That would make his subordinates, companions and bosses doubt his reliability and loyalty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivan also won the money of a regular casino guest, the son-in-law of a small country, a general. A shameless fox, but he was still in the hands of Ivan. He had to stay in the Palace of Heaven for a month, and he left in a week because he should have lost to Shane Battier. All the money went into Ivan's pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shawn Battier once secretly found a good card player. In blackjack, he let Ivan lose 500,000. When he noticed that Ivan wanted to retreat, he lost more and more. Ivan immediately ate this bait, and he thought that Ivan would continue to gamble with him, which is a pity. Ivan has never been to his gambling table - so that no matter whether he wins or loses, Hopkins must first let him lose his mind. Only the irrational Ivan Sergeyevich will spit out the profits swallowed from the paradise palace - it will be a powerful, irresistible blow, able to directly hollow out him, awkward all of a sudden Sean Battier is still waiting for Ivan's internal organs to make nightingales. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Hopkins told Shane Battier. He needs more gambling money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How much?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"50 million, or more."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem." Sean Battier did not hesitate to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you get ready tomorrow morning?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course." Battier Said the phone. Even with the low and regular noise of the tide, he was in his office and bedroom: "I have received the manager's report. I really didn't expect it. I thought I had to wait until Ivan noticed that you had at least two or three days. Dear old friend, twenty-five years, I am so happy to see that you are still charming."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought you know, money for me, you, And Ivan is like a bloody shark," Hopkins walked up to the balcony, the wind was cool, the moonlight was bright, and the fast-moving clouds were on the pale and thin faces of Hopkins and the ground on the balcony. Casting a shallow shadow, the ghoul's sharp nose smells the smell of the air. There is one or a few strains of laurel nearby. It is mellow and can easily be distinguished from other plants: "Battier, what do you think? In this case, the shark will automatically jump on the boat?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shawn Battier hesitated for a few seconds before he hesitated to give the answer: Food?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Usually, sharks will jump on the boat for bait or mistaken people on the fishing boat as seals or big fish. Hopkins thought, "Great white sharks and other ethnic sharks will also perform so-called Natural jumping, that is a jump without obvious motivation, we can guess that it may be to communicate or show its advantages and status, just like human beings standing tall or walking in front - this kind of jumping tends to be very high, And they will close their mouths at that time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't worry," Hopkins said: "Maybe tomorrow, you can bother with your troubles." It was solved."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, please pay attention to the two cute guys - I mean, red hair and green eyes."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Babel Tower - the institution's "hospital", a natural wonder (a piece The artificial miracle on the giant rock of thirty-story height stood up again after suffering unimaginable torture and destruction. , It is still gray, tall, Founder of the building, covered with glass windows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "g-zone" that was once exposed to the open belly in the light of the daylight has been fixed before all the buildings have received attention. During the initial period, the "patients" who were lucky enough to escape the fireworks filled the corridor but failed to escape the giant rock were caught by the "hunters" and directly smuggled with sedatives and anesthetics." The h" area, which is the research department of the organization, provides all the information they know and what they don't know, not many, and most of them useless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After now, many of the "hunters" of the organization are still struggling around the western continent, just to make up for this "big leak", know that the escaped criminals kill Everyone who dies will be the responsibility and burden that the organization has to face. The public relations personnel of the organization have all changed the entire three batches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So... those people?" Gregory Corso asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doctor in charge of receiving him did not know whether to say it or not. Gregory Corso smiled at him and pointed to wearing himself on his collar. The little sign, the jewel blue, indeed, in the notice the doctor got, the gentleman's level can be said to be very high, he can know what the average "hunter" can't know: "They have rested." After thorough research and use, "they can't be left behind." Too dangerous, and there are also ingredients that are angered, and the impact of this, even the top of the "institution" has spread. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
