			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Helicopter rolling, landing on an open space that has been rushed out, although it is known that the curved blades that keep whistling over the sky are still very far from their heads. Far, but Catherine still subconsciously lowered her head, opened the cabin door, and jumped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stood firm on a mottled ground, straightened up and looked around – she couldn’t believe it was the “Babel Tower” she used to be familiar with. "She doesn't even know where she is." Smoke and dust cover the sky, and there are thick colors of soil, twisted steel bars, broken concrete blocks, broken trough plates everywhere. The bright glass and metal protrude from the former and part of the limbs. The section flashed, and a large tree with a few feet of breast diameter stood firmly about 50 steps to her right front - upside down, the thick canopy crushed dozens of feet of ground, part of the leaves Covering the white foam of the fire extinguisher, the blackened roots tangled like a spider's hairy legs and strewn into the gray-blue sky. The two men are holding a small electric saw that should be used for autopsy. In a slight squeak, the interception of a branch of a manual path is intercepted. They are fully absorbed and dry, and the branches are covered with leaves. Dropped down, the breach oozes a translucent cyan juice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They gave way to Catherine and his team. This artificial path is very narrow and not very straight, because there are often large buildings that cannot be removed temporarily. In the middle of the road, Catherine and others were silent, and they followed the people who had come to greet for nearly half an hour before they saw it... The Ministry of Medicine, hesitated because the changes here did not let them I can't recognize it at all, but it's already big enough for them to be sure at the first sight. The white flat-topped tower is once like a human tooth. Now the tooth is pulled out. A hole, this hole is black and deep, and the edges are jagged. When Catherine walks over here, they can see layers of metal and rock that are like outwards. It is like a positive period, describing it as strange. The tropical rainforest flowers, a few gray-white fire hoses sticking out from the unrecognizable interior, spread evenly across the hole, which reminded Catherine of the stamens of the rose peony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I thought the war was far away from us." One of the companions muttered, "Is bombing or shelling here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing." The greeters stopped and stared at the horrible ruins with them: "An accident... detonated the oxygen cylinder warehouse."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine licked her lips and didn’t speak. Some of the people behind her were a bit strange in their expressions and eyes. The g district of Babel was not public, but insiders knew There is such a place, but most people do not have the opportunity and power to understand in depth - it is a cage that is said to be tight to a gap: there is no hidden room for personal privacy, pure steel, rock and electricity, one year 365 days a day, 24 hours a day, 24 hours a day and night, monitoring, in an emergency, can be completely closed, even the outside air and water can not enter the passage, prisoners with special abilities and more dangerous will be timed Injection of tranquilizers and muscles Relaxation agent, keeping it in a semi-conscious state unable to tame the - what exactly happened, will make the whole area becomes now the g miserable ghost gentile? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people around Catherine squirming their lips seem to want to ask other questions to relieve their confusion, but the greeter has turned around and strode forward Go, obviously, I am not prepared to say anything more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your holiday has been cancelled," this is the first time I saw Catherine. The first sentence they gave, the second sentence: "Go to work."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The short-term meeting will end, watching the last person walk out of his room, leaning against the head of the board in front of the desk and reaching into the cigar box behind him - containing his beloved candy, which takes place within a few hours. The things that made him a headache, and the pain in his mouth - but touched an empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leather chair that has been facing the entire office turned over, the cigar box was taken by another person, and he lifted it to the "Babel Tower" "The controller has raised Yang: "I thought you didn't need this long before." The strange man said calmly: "This kind of thing... eating too much is not good for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know." The head hesitated, but eventually decided to tell the truth to this person: "I can't control myself, my mood is terrible, I am slow. ...it can make me a little better - only these days... I have to control the situation... How much time do I have?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" How much time? We don't know," said the man. "Fortunately, we are not the FBI or the state bureau. We never let our team members and criminals appear in newspapers and on television, and never in the national psychiatric control study. The center registers for our patients, and now only a few people know how much leakage there is. - But these are limited to a guy who can't help but be tempted before, any one of them, once again committing crimes outside - you can't deny that their methods are special enough to be unforgettable, then we have to Explain to the rewarders and the damn bureaucrats." He paused and looked at his face with a bad face. He opened the cigar box and handed it over: "There have actually been people who express their sincere concern and sincerity. Blessed, they hope to...provide some necessary help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The toffee pinched between the fingers was made into two pieces by the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many people, "institution" is a sweet and huge toffee, it is not a real state machine, there is no real power that can be put on the table. There is no formal system, there is no clear system, no allocation from the state finance, and even a part of the social insurance system is missing. Although the institution is really rich, the rich does not need any of the country. Help, even if you don’t say that the accumulated rewards accumulated in recent decades (how many people are willing to go bankrupt in exchange for a chance of revenge), the foundation of a single institution, a foundation made up of the world’s richest man’s body is enough for this special The organization has been in operation for hundreds of years - the greedy politicians and families have been slow to start, perhaps because there is a lack of a large enough loophole to allow them to intervene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am sorry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head said. The toffee melted in his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man did not speak for a few minutes, and then he suddenly mentioned another topic that seemed to be irrelevant to the front; "Your...the situation is not good." When did it start?" He closed the cigar box and put it in his jacket: "Maybe you should do a thorough inspection, physical and psychological," he said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the workplace - that is, the one that was "exploded by the oxygen cylinder Catherine first met her partner before destroying the underground area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abel doesn’t look so good, it’s normal, people who pass by such a serious disaster will not have any good looks, but let Catherine is surprised that the man’s attitude and mood are very different from the previous ones... Especially when facing her, his emotional swings are extremely chaotic, soft and fragile... it’s hard to see; others think and act. I have never been able to break away from the nest, the legs and arms are strong and stable, the reaction is quick, the mind is clear, and the work is as good as ever. The elevators connecting the Tower of Babel and the outside are almost completely paralyzed, and the helicopters are loaded with things. The ability of other action team members is more destructive. Only Abel can provide the drugs, tools and equipment that are needed now - as long as there is life, and the research center in Babel is a variety of creatures, mice, Rabbits, monkeys, orangutans... It’s okay to consume it, except for people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
