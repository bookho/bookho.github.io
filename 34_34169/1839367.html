			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishb and Sasha quickly exchanged a look. In front of Beppe, they did not want to talk in depth about the problems of the abilities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am going to the library," Beppe said. "Is there anything I need to borrow?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishb looks at the window, the late autumn night always comes very early, the sky shows a strong dark blue, from top to bottom, the gradient is soft gunpowder blue, the mountains are dark like a piece The silhouette, the recess follows the red light of the wine, and the gleaming Grand River bends at the foot of the mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The library's opening hours have returned to normal?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The wall of the dormitory hall "The notice," Sasha said: "It is said that they have caught the criminals who abused animals - a tramp, addict, has been withdrawn, and the 24-hour patrol mission will continue for a while, but basically The matter has passed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Grand School has spent money, and a scum from the city of Lafayette is provided by the Northern Nephew." Beppe said that now Lafayette, the original power of "Abby" was not erased or was absorbed by the "Massaye" of the North or the Sea God Island, and it was used for its own purposes. But it is still very easy to find out what is inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grand school’s school is also a must. Sixty percent of the students’ “illegally hiding, using and selling prescription drugs” has just subsided. Going on, they don't need more topics - the school board took the initiative and took the very resort, only to solve the whole thing in the shortest time - miraculously, as if this terrible crime is really by that Made by a tramp with mental illness, since he was arrested, Grande has never seen cats and dogs that have been abused and killed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that the feeding point of the ownerless cat and dog needs to be replaced. The dark brown boardwalk, especially the cow cat and its four Where the kitten died, the living cat and dog never approached, even if there was a large pot of savory squid and meat bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cleaners couldn't clean the pieces of carbonized pine that were contaminated by the cat's blood and they were replaced. The newly-changed pines are lighter and rougher than the original ones, and they remind people of what has happened here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But one day, they will become as smooth and dark as their companions around. The bloody suffocating in the earth will also disappear - the greatness of time is that it will erase all traces - there are so many creatures on earth, survival is so difficult and long, who will The small death of the pile is remembered from beginning to end? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Besib came out of the bathroom, Beppe was gone, Big Hopkins and Little Hopkins were still there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I remember," said Wesib, who is wet, "You and I said that the emergence of the abilities was at the end of the last century, in this century. At the beginning, there was a large amount of ...breaking, and then there were more abilities?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You said the father who has neither the abilities There is also no omnipotent mother's abilities?" Sasha said: "Yes. But very few, very few, the agency's registration information is only about a dozen."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""Institutions let you see their registration information?" Besib was a little surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great Hopkins smiled slyly, as long as the organization has a normal person. It would not allow a former hunting object to look up the identity information of the hunter, but they gave him the name of the "Ghoul" rewarder as promised. In this short contact, he got a small person. Trust, he is like a cautious spider, crawling up the thin line. Quiet, not inciting a person to infiltrate the less rigorous big net - just as he had seen his wanted order on the FBI's internal website, he rummaged through the information of the agency It's as simple as taking a book from your own shelf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Sasha, Catherine’s memory is undefended for him, and Catherine may not know that each has passed her, or one or two The name of the person. Sasha can copy their faces with sketches and electronic imaging. The next step is to follow the map and ask for the development of the network. Even if the organization repeatedly makes a decision, their "staff" is not allowed to leave photos for retrieval on the Internet. But as long as you think about it, you can still find it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So," Besib wisely did not go to the bottom: "Avery. Famo suddenly became a Heracles?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "After being expelled from the football team," Sasha said: "About two weeks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No one has contacted him, I mean "Outsiders." Big Hopkins said, holding his son's hair, the hair because of sleeping or other relationships, the sharpness is particularly powerful: "He didn't go home on weekends."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about the school?" Besib asked: "Teacher, or student?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To say that the contact is compared "More," Big Hopkins said: "Only your coach, and his roommate, they are cleaner than white paper."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besb ​​memories After a while, shaking his head, he did not remember that Avery and other people were close and close. Before he did not, he and everyone were getting along well, but there were no deep friends, after the accident, teachers and students Departed He is far away, he mentioned another thing that made him strange. In his impression, Avery can be said to be a big-minded guy. He spent two years in St. Thomas Church Elementary School (Sasha is It was not known to him in the past, and he did not transfer to Sasha for a long time. He also transferred to Grande and went straight to the fourth grade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His parents gave him nearly half a dozen tutors, but his achievements have always been described as unsatisfactory, but Grand’s recommendation is When he applied for college, he became a member of the football team! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Avery wants to apply for a university of 123," Besib confusedly said: "Of course, there is a football team captain title. It’s very good, but it’s a bit too hard.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;”He changed his mind,” said Anthony Hopkins: “He wants to enter Manchester. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said that rugby is a dangerous sport," Sasha said sarcastically: "especially for the brain."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is for a reason," Big Hopkins patiently explained: "He has a sister, called Ferrola. Famo."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib and Sasha immediately remembered the photo, and the pair of chests that were close to perfection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ferrara. Famo’s agent reported that she was killed by several robbers, and the police also closed the case. The problem is that Ferrola Famo has a fiancé who loves her very much, they are getting married, and this man is a veteran, like the movie, he suspects that the case is not so simple, he went to find Ferrara's agent I didn't get valuable clues, so he went to find Ferrara's partner. They didn't know anything. Finally, he found a girl with the same agent as Ferrola. The girl refused to say anything. But he finally digs out the truth from her mouth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fact?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Flora was brought to a secret small gathering by her agent at the end of the night. Yes, that kind of party, there is a young boy who is an admirer of Ferrola."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's fine." Besib said, he knows what dance party is, one , It is not a big mistake, at most, will suck powder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s not known to us, but after only about ten minutes, the boy ran out. He wanted to make an emergency call and was stopped by several people. At that time, Ferrola’s female companion was in another room. She didn’t know what was going on. She only saw Ferrola being lifted out, her chest wrapped around her blood-soaked cashmere shawl, and the boy cried and said, He killed Ferrola. She didn't know the boy, but she remembered that he had proudly mentioned that he would become a member of the 'Lion Club' next year."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"She told that?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And the disk is out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then he is now "How's it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You said the girl? Unfortunately, she was overdose, dead; or that? He died because of his job, he told the secret His partner, a female police officer named Jessie, has now disappeared."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Avery has evidence on hand?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If there is, we don't have to discuss anything related to him anymore." Big Hopkins said: "He has nothing, evidence, Testimony, witness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
