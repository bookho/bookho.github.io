			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The towers of the Ariau Hotel are connected by wooden plank roads, and the unwelcome "guests" encroach on the first tower as the reception hall. Fortunately, because the relationship has always been used as a reception, there are not many rooms in the first tower. The trouble is that the guests who need to leave and just arrived are gathered here. God bless, the guard captain Joe finally got them all down (the tower is 4th floor), then drove his "Lamb" like a diligent and strict shepherd dog to the hall of the second tower through the plank road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why don't you shoot? Why don't you kill those monsters!" An old man yelled at the guards: "They ate my nephew!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The animals are hard to kill," one of the guards looked pale, but still explained as gently as possible: "The injured giant will attack any madly Like the creatures it can encounter, let alone the mating ball..." The cockroach that was interrupted and mated is even more terrifying. Once those cold-blooded animals entwined with enthusiasm for the purpose of breeding are disturbed, they are crowded in a space of less than 200 square meters. At least forty people in the hall at least half will be left in Ariau by Mori's teeth and body forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are neglecting your duty and deliberately murdering!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We must first guarantee you Our safety, sir, someone has already gone..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shut up! Call your manager!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp It seems that it is safe, the tourists are starting to cry, complaining, yelling, asking for all kinds of demands, and always what they are; the guests of the second tower are also coming out of their rooms to ask questions. In fact, compared with the former, they are more interested and full of emotions. Even many people whispered to discuss whether they can take a close look at the “Eating of the People” and ask for compensation from the hotel... Well, A certain amount of mental damage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is human." Anthony Hopkins whispered: "Unfortunately, I am also one of them."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you say?" Guard Captain Joe took off his hat and grabbed his hair. The words Anthony just said were Latin, and he couldn't understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, I mean," Anthony smiled. "Need help?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Need, of course, no matter what identity, place, time, what kind of disaster, doctors are always better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before approaching the first patient, Mr. Anthony Hopkins sniffed in the air secretly, and he smelled the good news on Sasha. The milky scent, and the Catherine's scent of sulphur and violet scent (the bath provided by the hotel), they are nearby, but not in the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s enough to know that she is not far from her. Anthony has no intention of disturbing her daughter and that Catherine. It’s a real life, why do a pair of twin sisters have to use one? Name?) communication. During this time, he can find some fun for himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hop Hopkins pulled a chair and sat on the "because the scorpion was swallowed in front of him" and was a bit irrational and thinking In front of the old man, he has developed from blaming, blasphemy, and curse to sue the entire Ariau. From its founders, shareholders, managers, guards, and service personnel, no one can run. He vows to let them one by one. Going home, and staying in prison for a lifetime. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, it seems that the scorpion that is melting in the powerful digestive juice of Mori is not the focus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very old, but still full of greed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you like roast lamb with saffron?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Hopkins Asked this way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*What constitutes a little girl? Candy, spices and all the good things. What constitutes a little boy? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tail of scissors, snails and pet puppies. *<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine doesn't like children, or she doesn't like children like ordinary women. She doesn't like to stare at children, and she doesn't want to hear them. Sound, don't want to touch their hair or hug them, because the impression left by the children is very bad - the twelve years spent in the orphanage, let her fully understand the rosy faces and purity as the sky What is hidden under the eyes of the eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small fists can cause unforgettable pain in the eyes and nose, and the insults in the tender mouth can lick your like a knife. heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, she is still vigilant and alienated from any child, even if she is an adult, she no longer has to worry about being attacked by her, whether it is psychological Still physiology - she won't hurt them, she will even save them (if they are at risk), but she will never get close to them, active or passive. Like Chalice White's child, she certainly provided the police and the hospital with what she had learned from Richard's memory for their subsequent investigation and treatment, but she did not look at it except the necessary contacts. Have a look at this child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But my sister’s children are different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sister is stronger than her, more powerful than her, smarter than her. At the orphanage, she has been protecting Catherine. It is a pity that this protection has not been maintained for too long. After her sister was adopted, she determined that she would not return. The children immediately began to intensify their teasing and torture of Catherine. They even regard this as a daily entertainment and traditional program... Catherine has been waiting hard, waiting for her sister to come back, or take her with her, this ridiculous idea has been stubbornly lingering in her In the brain, even until she graduated from high school, leaving the orphanage to go to college has never stopped. After graduating from college, Catherine thought for a long time, and finally came to a conclusion - her sister is not coming, but can not come She was controlled by what. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be her to find her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine immediately put her ideas into action, she works day and night, so I have enough money and time to find my sister, clues But it ended up in the personnel archive of the police station... She used to be unable to do anything. Fortunately, the “institution” found her and lured her to work in the agency by looking for her sister Catherine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although four years ago, a huge, painful, whole-body pain has made Catherine feel like she is in the world. The only relatives have completely left themselves, but another warm, looming and wonderful summons has finally allowed her to agree to work in institutions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine uses her special abilities to track and search for “prey” for the “action group”, while doing all her power and institutional commitment and giving the right to seize the seemingly unquestionable clue, even if she I don't understand where this call came from. She even guessed that her sister had only encountered a life-threatening accident, was injured or turned into a vegetative, not a complete death, but never guessed that this wonderful warm feeling came from Inherited by the blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sister has left, but she left her own child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although she has seen this child, she found her name on the hotel’s registration record (Sasha, what a lovely name, a whole one The name of the morning went back and forth between her lips tens of thousands of times), and considered in detail how to take and support her, but the small arm in Sasha stretched tightly around her neck, and her arm also When she really embraced the small, soft warm body, Catherine still couldn't help but want to cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before picking up Sasha, Catherine finally glanced at Jack, who turned and left, he was a good man, a good boss and a good partner... maybe It will be a good lover, he has been taking care of Catherine, and Catherine has not even said a thank you to him, and I am sorry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She probably won’t go back to the organization, it’s very strange, she almost threw all her time in the agency in the past two years – office or Dormitory, where she has friends and familiar colleagues, a plexiglass desk, her bed, her wardrobe, her bookshelf, a puppy she raised, I hope Emma can take care of it instead of her. There is also a steaming jam egg roll... all of which makes her heart feel a hard-to-remove emotion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but they can’t compare with Sasha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fear brought by Mori is not worth mentioning at all. Catherine holds her tightly. The child is as light as a feather in her arms, she thinks I can run her hundreds of miles with her effortlessly, or go through the entire river in reverse, even if it is through the entire Amazon jungle, she will go on until they will hinder them. The people together are completely smashed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha’s arm is licking Catherine’s neck, the young woman’s soft, elastic muscles are regularly undulating under her little finger, her breath is fragrant Hold her arm tightly and trembling from time to time, then tighten. Sometimes this tightening even affected the breathing of Sasha, but she did not feel unbearable. The female's arms gave her unprecedented comfort and happiness. Her love for Sasha was real and enthusiastic. These feelings are being transmitted to the nerves of her with the heat of her body through the skin of the sand, and then directly penetrate the brain and heart through the nerves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little girl greedily feels it all and carefully imprints every detail in her memory so that she will I can enjoy this kind of experience in the memory of my own life, not only combining sunlight and hot springs, but also directly acting on the body and soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Right turn." Only when she needs to guide her direction will she stop feeling and absorb this sweet emotion... Catherine always does not hesitate Obey her arrangement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where is this?" When they finally stopped, Catherine found that they were far from the crowd, although it should also be part of the Ariau Hotel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Merry told me, a secret base." Sasha said, indicating that Catherine was holding her down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
