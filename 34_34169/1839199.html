Mr. Bissau:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sitting now Write a letter to you at the library's writing desk. Sasha is sitting across from me. He is also writing to Mr. Anthony Hopkins. Since he got here, he writes to Hopkins every day. After half an hour, with a smile, it seems that I am doing something pleasant and unfortunate - so that, although you have clearly stated that the Hopkins are slimy (slimmed down) tenderness "Communication" has made you feel creepy more than once, but I still want to try it, if possible, please tell me what you feel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please don't worry, I am thinking about what I should write. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t remember which idiot told me that the boarding school on the western continent is as soft and sweet as cotton candy, the teachers are reasonable, amiable, and the students are enthusiastic. Simple, helpful, easy to learn, enjoy life every day - I mean, there is everything on campus, cigarettes, wine, music, all-night dance, 24-hour hypermarket, guns, magazines, indulgence of young girls There are even 妓/女 (not that I want this) - if you remember, please remind me to slap him. (This paragraph is completely removed)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no smoking, only milk, juice, soda and cola, the commissary and the clinic are only open until 9 pm On Saturdays, there is no opening on Sundays, music and dances are there, but I hate chant choirs and waltzes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may know more clearly than I know, anyway, you picked this, a seemingly heavenly but hell (hell is drawn) monastery The ghost place, this may be nothing to be strange, it was originally a big monastery. People who have been here for centuries have long been accustomed to the old and harsh attitudes of life and are as good as they are - but have you seen our school badge? The shield, the book and the thorns decorate the lace? The following is a picture of the 1795, squiggly, like the squiggly letter on the wine bottle (the previous sentence was crossed out), that is the date it was created - do you really feel a little dangerous? I mean, we are sitting in a classroom that lasts for more than three times the age of our great-grandfather, and it’s eighty-four minutes, then walk through the same crispy corridor in four minutes, and it’s possible to go to another, perhaps more historic. Forbidden room - Everyone has more than twelve pounds of books in their hands? (Note 1) Every time I ran under the promenade with a vaulted dome, the echo was like someone ringing the church bell in my ear. I had to run away quickly, I was always worried. There will be a large piece of stone falling. Just lying on my head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of running, dear "Tang", I can endure the one-and-a-half-hour course. But the four minutes left in the middle is ridiculous in being too mixed (the mixed ball is gone)! I can't even go to the bathroom! It is strictly forbidden to hide in the back of the bush or pull the chain of pants behind the statue. Of course, it is not allowed under the desk. Even if they are just cheap goods made of bakelite composite panels and ferrous metal square tubes - we can put some personal items and books in the closet against a wall, but have I said before? The teachers here are like stubborn hermit crabs. They (they are crossed out) their office is in the classroom, a long table full of office equipment, photos, books and other textbooks; they are allowed to decorate their territory, so the walls of the classroom are covered A variety of pictures, forms, small cards, maps, homemade calendars and student homework, as well as many things we can't understand, some classroom ceilings will be filled, when we are attending classes. They float like the ribbon on the ship that first entered the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha told me that this is already very good, his elementary school classroom is even more terrible - almost all the materials and colors in the world can be found there. - I said where is his primary school? Carnival? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teachers here, they may indeed be capable guys. But not as good as I have known on the Internet, they are gracious to every student, but that doesn't mean they don't have homework and exams. In fact, the courses here are very tension. We need to prepare, study, review and do homework every day. Sasha can sleep for seven hours. And I can only sleep for six hours, or five hours. Fortunately, there is an hour of rest in the afternoon. We can take a nap in the classroom of the first class in the afternoon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every student who has forgotten his homework and quiz results will be given more attention and guidance by the teachers. I don’t know if this is a good one. A good thing, they will become extraordinarily harsh until you change your mind or your grades change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relationship between them is not as good as it seems. To be correct, they are hostile to each other, when a student asks for a teacher’s request or idea. And ignoring the words of another teacher, he will be tossed by the latter for a long time - I have observed, indeed. And some of them are really annoying. For example, Mr. Huf, who always shows off his "eighteenth-century gay research special medal" in history class, I said, the rules of Mr. Sandy, the sea god island can not It is a pity to use it here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are very few opportunities for Sasha to meet in class time. There are 130 electives and six compulsory courses, but there are also electives in the compulsory courses. For example, in the second language, I chose Spanish. And Sasha chose Latin. We only have four classes overlapping, mathematics, literature and history. The time, credits, teachers and places of each different course are different. (I have to complain again here, why do we have to pay 45,000 yuan a year? Run half-dead, but the person who gets the salary just needs to sit comfortably?)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We only have to meet each other during lunch and after-school activities. After-school activities have to watch our club activities time. Fortunately, we live together. The dormitory here is a suite of three people. Each suite has a bathroom and a small hall. The staff are randomly assigned, but they can be willing to In the case of the exchange, so I did not get together with Sasha at first, I was waiting in his suite, when his roommate appeared, I talked with him sincerely. He immediately agreed to my request, he is really a good person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other roommate is a mainlander, a solid little guy, he is a football team, he is Avery, always staring at Sasha It’s not a stop, and it’s better to wait for Sasha to talk to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, this guy doesn't matter, although he seems to have met with Sasha, but he is just an ordinary person. To be more precise, his family is very rich, but there is no background. Only one distant cousin is trying to run for the city councilor. He and Sasha have repeatedly smashed a few big sums that their family has set aside for this matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t like him, not only because he is too stupid, but also the same unbearable greasy, he behaves like Hopkins Old mom or tail! (or the tail is crossed out)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha does not matter. Madonna bless, I guess Dr. Hopkins’s homework class must be very good. Before that, I never thought that Sasha Hopkins would be so bad in taking care of the individual. It’s not that he is lazy or clumsy. He was too clever - for the first time, his homemade cleaning solution not only dissolved him and all my shirts. Even the inner wall of the washing machine was damaged (the school added a new school rule), and the second time, all our clothes became dried, including my favorite piece and hard bow tie. No matter how many ways we think we can't make them recover - there are still many things like this, I won't mention it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the cleaning liquid Sasha also intends to continue to study and improve. I and Avery jointly stopped him. Now some things are done by Avery. . He is not a professional, but at least it will not let our administrators collapse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, I must mention the food here. The school offers three meals in the morning, middle and late, full of weight, lack of variety, and unique taste... so when I eat enough pie and mashed potatoes, I will cook, including the sweet basil sauce of the old Andriana. , salmon steak, assorted seafood soup and cheese-baked rice; Sasha also cooks, it doesn't look bad, but in many cases he is alone and willing to swallow those things - please pass my questions to Dr. Hopkins How did he raise the sand? Wrap the lamb leg and mustard kelp pie with chocolate? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, I have to report my results in the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now Sasha has been studying for me for an hour a day, but I don’t think we should have too much hope. There are too few schools on the sea god island, and here too Many, respected "Tang", I saw in a movie, in order to help an actor to have a chance to perform, someone cut off the head of the director's most beloved horse and placed it on his master's bed. - The horse is worth 300,000 yuan. I have already investigated that our high school principal has a hybrid prairie cat worth only 12,000 yuan. The president of the university you expect and look forward to has a few worth 5,000 yuan. / Each red giant poodle, we may start from here, how do you see it? (The whole paragraph is drawn here.)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am attaching my latest test scores. (This sentence is omitted)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a bit tragic, but I have to say that this is not my fault. (This sentence is drawn)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The course here is a bit difficult for me, I think I need some time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your child. Besib. Bissand, respect<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;April 1 night <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha wrote to Anthony. Hopkins's letter: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib wrote a letter to Chegaler Bissand, but he sent the draft to him by mistake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to thank him for his compliments, I have enclosed the letters he has written and the latest test scores. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can hand them over to Chegaler, Bissand, and he will be happy to see his son's progress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
