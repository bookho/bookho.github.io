Personal information card - There are reporters taking the elevator to the eighth floor, and then climbed to the ninth floor through the safe fire exit, but when they push the door, the Manchester hospital's security personnel have been waiting outside for a long time - they probably never You will know that there is a small and independent monitoring room on the ground floor of the hospital. It is specially designed for the 9th floor. There are 24 hours of uninterrupted staring TV screens on the wall, and the 9th floor security staff. It is also the largest in the entire hospital. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time to stare at the monitor screen is the most difficult, but your job is this, long, boring and very stressful - a few seconds of negligence It can ruin tens of thousands of hours of hard work - so smart people can always try to find some fun from this boring job that makes people feel depressed. Since they are all men, looking at women naturally becomes a reality. It’s a matter of course. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most patients in the hospital except the nurses are nurses, and the nurses are almost all women. The person responsible for monitoring the screen can almost recognize each of them. Look at the face, they are familiar with their chest and butt, and the way to walk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Look at this, really good." A sultry guy said to his companion. The nurse on the screen is getting out of the elevator, the monitor probe is condescending, and the nurse's suit is open with two buttons, "Fantastic fluctuations." He commented sweetly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His companion looked at the monitor screen inside the elevator - the nurse brushed a tight bun, slightly lowered her head, she did have a big breast, Even if you keep holding the box, you can see it clearly - ah. The deep gully, he quickly shook his head: "Is Susie? I don't remember the newcomers who have been here on the 9th floor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe give The doctor sent something."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ask Bob to see if someone applied for a temporary information card."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The object being questioned immediately pressed the button in front of it, waited for a while, the call was connected. Bob’s voice came out of the speaker, but before they asked the question, there was a loud noise at the end of the call. The sound wave swayed in a small, confined room, and the human eardrum screamed in severe pain. The screams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time is slightly back to a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are four medical elevators on the nine floors, which have no armrests. The front and rear doors can be opened. Under normal circumstances, doctors, nurses and visitors are not recommended. The latter can use two passenger elevators. Brian has a temporary information card. He took Boa, Douglas and Daley and a faceless, unsmiling clinical medical team in an elevator, others need to wait for another, Dr. Smith with them to ensure they have information cards Start the elevator. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baoer. Douglas glanced at Sasha before entering the elevator. This little bastard was unexpectedly meek and silent today. Catherine was really dry. Little Hopkins is not afraid of Boa. Douglas. He just hates him, just like hating a cockroach that sucks blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elevator door opened and a nurse came out. When she walked over, Sasha smelled a clear perfume. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chiz Carson cast a doubtful look at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing," Sasha said. "Maybe today is the first day after she finishes her long vacation." He smelled the smell of Guerlain perfume, which is very Normally, nurses and doctors are also humans. Of course, they can rub perfume, but he can't smell another smell that he should have - the smell that is caused by long-term infiltration of alcohol, drugs, and disinfectant. Anthony Hopkins has been away from the hospital for more than a decade, but occasionally Sasha can still smell the smell that is familiar from a baby. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elevator is shining. Facing the door is a silver mirror, and the top is a black mirror. The dense LED lamp illuminates the interior of the elevator like a star. The ground is a frosted black titanium stainless steel. The back plates and armrests on both sides are polished and polished stainless steel, which is held cold and ice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lor, standing next to Sasha, moved, she wore a pair of thin-soled shoes today, and there was something under her feet that was holding her, making her very Comfortable, she removed her foot and looked down. It was a silver metal piece, a round, white house pattern, a coin worth one dollar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She bent over to pick it up, but she just twirled it, it seemed to be stuck on the floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be chewing gum." Lol whispered, she had decided to give up, but before she straightened up, she grabbed her shoulder with one hand, and caught her back and pulled her back violently. Screamed, the back of the head hit the glass mirror of the elevator. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the button position, Dr. Smith suddenly appeared an arm, his arm crossed his chest, and his finger hurriedly held "7", "6 ". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bold "8" is flashing on the screen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elevator accepted the order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!" Lol protested angrily, she wanted to slap Hopkins, and Chiz Carson rushed to catch her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coins stuck to the floor are shaking, extremely slight, and almost imperceptible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number is converted to "7". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go out immediately as soon as the door opens!" he ordered sternly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elevator car is slightly down, first the car door, then the hall door. The outside light penetrates into the interior of the elevator. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha pulled the gun out of the holster hidden under his arm, and everyone else (both inside and outside) could not react Previously, he opened a small gap through the elevator door and fired a shot at the outside ceiling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of guns in the West is three to four. When the gunshots are heard, the people in the elevator immediately curl up and The people outside squatted and ran away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vibration of the coin suddenly strengthened, and even Lor and Chiz, hidden behind the sand, could feel the shaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The car door continues to open, but the hall door is maintained at a width that allows only one cat to enter and exit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people in the elevator looked up at the upper end of the car door, they heard the sound of rolling, the goalball driven by the car door is trying to fulfill their duties, but Its efforts are futile, and... they probably haven't had much time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Damn. It's broken!" Lol called. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's obvious." Sasha muttered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib’s legs can kick off the stakes, stones and iron bars like some of his boxers blow, compared to his coming to Hopkins It's not as good as it is, but he is much more powerful than the average person - the small piece of silver is about one inch in diameter, but thicker than the real one, about half an inch. Like this size, it is tightly glued to the metal floor. To knock it down, you have to use a large, hard, thin screwdriver. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha. Hopkins calmly, exhausted his whole body and kicked a foot against the ground, and the metal floor made a "squeaky" dull sound. The dark, dark thing flipped out and ejected—passing through the narrow hallway, flying through the hallway, and smashing the window glass while it exploded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Sasha had raised his hand to block his face, but still splashed glass and metal fragments tore his lambskin jacket and cotton Shirt, skin and muscles. Behind him are Lor and Chiz. Lor gave a sharper and more screaming scream than before, and her calf was cut. Chiz was not completely spared, the debris hit her ear, and a deep visible bone wound was drawn in her eye, but she just trembled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elevator door is automatically closed, the number on the screen flashes, and the elevator is very quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is...bomb?" Dr. Smith, who was curled up under the button panel, asked dryly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A miniature zd that is not proportional to its size and size. The shape and color are similar to the r43 (diameter) button-type silver oxide battery. Most of the people who use it are thieves and spies. Sasha Hopkins made a purchase with Pepi at Christmas. Who knows that he has almost died on this for dozens of days - thanks to the stubborn designer, neither the thief nor the spy wants the warning of the shock that might expose them or zd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha turned his head, he just wanted to say something, and another sudden shock and roar interrupted his attempt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This explosion was from the outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The led light went out and the elevator crashed in the darkness - this time not only Lor, everyone. Except for Sasha, they couldn't help but scream - accompanied by sharp, harsh metal scraping. The two-way safety pliers acted within six feet and the elevator was stuck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The car is filled with a smell that is not very good. Still others are crying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well..." Dr. Smith trembled and said, "Nothing...we..." safe, he wants to say that, But the ominous snoring overwhelmed his voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is that sound?" Chiz asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Someone is opening the door below," Sasha said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of an oil chamber slips from the empty tunnel of the elevator shaft: "Sasha Baby? Haro!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Lor's brain was a mess, she thought about rushing to the ground and shouting for help in the direction of the voice, but she heard something bad - very bad things. She sat in the corner of the elevator and blocked her mouth with her fist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Smith is also cleverly silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another voice below, or that person, he actually happily blows the tune, it is the first sloppy song, he blew a few bars I paused: "What do you think? This is my favorite song. It is a good day. The weather is very good. There are beautiful girls everywhere. There is this elevator. I like this elevator. They use metal. It’s a good idea to decorate the car, but they didn’t use silver. The conductivity of silver is the best – my hand is on – what is this thing? In short, I am looking at my ball. The ball is slamming up to it - my cute little mouse, little monster, do you like to simmer slowly or sizzle?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't I suggest you do this." Sasha calmly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have a Carson around me, and there is a Lor. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
