			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And I still want a child, a healthy child," Hefner confirmed: "It is better to be a boy."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am afraid many people think that you are very satisfied with your daughter." A girl, but good enough, graduated from Vanderbilt College, and received her JD from Columbia University in 1996. He has worked as a lawyer and transferred back to his father's company three years later - as a senior staff member, responsible for some luxury hotels, record companies, casinos and book publishing companies. It is said that Hefner loves this daughter very much, although he has been playing the role of spokesperson since he was 30 years ago - dyeing every beautiful girl who is awkward in life, the female partner around him is like a horse-like rotation, even I tried the same sex once, smoked cigars, tasted the wine, and the garage was filled with all kinds of new sports cars, but in front of his daughter, he always appeared in the image of a loving and orthodox father. He carefully managed himself and his daughter. Relationship - Never allow any female partner to appear in front of her daughter, participate in every parent-child activity held in the community or school, take her to the dentist on time, go to the amusement park, and buy another quiet and noble house next to the school district. For her, she is equipped with drivers, bodyguards, and servants. Before she reaches adulthood, every time she wants to go to her father’s company or the big mansion, these two places will experience a sweeping cleaning and finishing. Dressed neatly, no bunny, no spirits, no cigarettes, no bikinis, not even a slightly violent insert or cover . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is Hefner's little bread, little baby, his pride. Especially in the last two years, Hefner has rarely appeared in public places. He is more willing to hide in the club and do nothing to enjoy and share. Many people guess/determine that he will build this house in countless glamorous girls within ten years. The palace on the whole was delivered to his own heirs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Monica had something wrong." Hefner glared at the ceiling, and ten fingers crossed in a hurry. "I haven't done anything yet." Open."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey," Hopkins reveals a purely sympathetic color: "This is really sad."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hefner was silent for a while: "I want another child, if possible, a boy, a girl," he rolled his lips and said: " I haven't reached 60, I am in good health, the doctor has tested my sperm/child, the number is very large and very lively, I will have heirs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course," Hopkins said sincerely: "Of course."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you want to see her?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My daughter, Monica." Hefner stood up and went to the bar. He poured a glass of whiskey for himself. He added a few pieces of ice to the cup. Without a stirring spoon, he straightened his fingers and stirred it up. Then he drank it: "You can go with me, I will go see it every day." She."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins gave him a pity, this man did put a lot of energy on his daughter, he loved her, he still told her I have the illusion that she can suddenly stand up one day and continue to live as usual. It is a painful and hopeful thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this does not prevent him from managing his business sensibly and soberly, entertaining guests, dating girls and preparing to marry and give birth to one or more other children. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You decide," Hefner shrugged his shoulders: "I can visit Monica at any time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is it at night? Six o'clock, or seven o'clock."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Six o'clock," Hefner made the decision: "We can advance the dinner and then come back before the club opens."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the two men left the room, they heard strange sounds in the corners - subtle complaints, accusations, and physical collisions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you think is that?" Hefner asked: "Hopkins?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "The little mouse is screaming." The ghoul replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I like your sense of humor," Hefner said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one of them has a look at it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie spent the strength of the boss to pull Betty who wanted to rush into the room (she was only wrapped in a bath towel), she didn’t mind I think Gucci Hefner will be influenced by Betty - even if she is the most likely girl to be the best playmate of the year, this is no longer a question of who is right or wrong - now Hefner is petting Lilith Mayer, the former is a man who can be very deep and specific when necessary, and who can also be cold-blooded. He will not be happy that his authority and vision are questioned by a humble bunny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At the very least, you have to make yourself clean and beautiful!" Bonnie whispered: "You look like a cat that has been run over by a car! I don't think Mr. Hefner will change his appetite in a timely manner - even if he suddenly starts to be interested in ghosts or zombies!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know you are just Betty is very angry," Betty was very angry, but Bonnie was right, she knew, and Bonnie’s strength was great. If she insisted on her original thoughts, she would have to fight with Bonnie again: "You will be fast. Get out of the way, so you don't want any accidents!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie took a deep breath, Betty said it was not completely wrong, she was naive The little girl is a bit responsible. She is Betty's introducer and instructor, given the close relationship between them, if she is really out of reach, she will be deducted all the bonuses - especially It was the one before the departure, which was handed by Mr. Hefner, ranging from one hundred yuan to five thousand yuan. It depends on how specific, most important, the feelings of Mr. Hefner was the girl's past performance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie needs the money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just don't want you to run into a bloody head." Bonnie grabbed Betty's arm, the latter grinning and writhing angrily. Trying to break free from her suppression: "Listen, Betty," Bonnie leaned closer to the peach-like face: "Don't be so good, you've done a good job, you got Mr. Hefner's appreciation, in In the near future, your photos will be on the magazine cover or inserts, or even both, you can get a lot of money, after which you may find a willingness to marry you in the club. The football star is a rock star. After a few years, you have everything, villas, yachts, diamonds, global travel... Imagine, dear, how wonderful your future will be... So, now, go back now Go to the doctor in the room, let him take a good look at your face and body, and strive to heal as soon as possible - before and after healing, try not to appear in front of Lilith Mayer, this may not be easy, but try? You don't want to be kicked by her ? & Nbsp;; & nbsp; & nbsp out the words "<br <br /> & nbsp />;"You are an idiot, Bonnie." Betty scornfully said: "You can't do it, it doesn't mean I can't. - The ready-made goods are in front of me. Why should I wait? Lilithmeer doesn't have a diamond ass. I just didn't have a chance - I warned you, come back to me for trouble, I will..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How are you?" Bonnie loosened. She - Hefner has gone far enough anyway, and she looks at her arm with a stern look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In short...you are waiting." Betty reluctantly stepped back two steps. "You will see."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I suggest that you pray three times a day from today, pray that Lilith Mayer's memory is as bad as a goldfish." Bonnie said coldly: "Othermore, you will be more than me." "Get out of the way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Betty stuck to the wall, spoke at her and quickly slammed into the hallway, looking at the corner with her eyes, not seeing the state Nie followed, her courage immediately got bigger - on the way, she swayed, yelling, yelling, and almost knocked down Cassie who came from the corridor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cassy whistled. "She is guilty again?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is old It’s going to provoke some guys who shouldn’t be tempted.” Bonnie pressed her own temple, her head was faint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have too much fun, even if you introduce it - there is no one who will connect you." Cassie said slyly: " Mr. Hefner will understand.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Hope so. Where are you going?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Women, how? Going to have fun together?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie just wants to go back to the room, but Cassie is too warm, Bonnie is her I broke into the gym and had a good time. There were only two of them in the gym. They first opened the steam bath valve and then walked on the gray drive belt. After about fifteen minutes, Bonnie felt tired and she jumped. On the treadmill, walk slowly to the floor-to-ceiling glass and do yoga on the sun-filled cushions. Bikini is not suitable for this kind of exercise. She simply takes them off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked at herself in the mirror, her body, her muscles were tight, her skin was smooth, and her sweat was dripping with golden light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's beautiful." Cassie said that she started yoga with Bonnie, her skin is darker than others, but more delicate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie gave her a look. Cassie is not a person who will compliment others. To be exact, every girl here is a self-sufficient, self-sufficient person who never points out the merits of others and wants to sing others' shortcomings into songs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She obviously has something to say, Bonnie gave her a bad chance until she entered the steam bath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After some exercise, both of them were sweating, and the white steam (mixed with the scent of red pine) drowned them all at once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Casty diligently got a cold lemon soda for Bonnie, and then made his request in a hurry - as mentioned above, each Girls who have the privilege of entering the mansion can apply to Hefner for a beauty fund to perfect their face and body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie doesn't like plastic surgery, and is quite satisfied with her body, so she hasn't used this right yet, and Cassie wants the money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think you have had surgery in the first half of the year," Bonnie said with sincerity: "You are not satisfied with it, chest or ass?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No," Cassie shook his head in frustration. She stretched her neck and put her face in front of Bonnie: "Look at my face."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie’s eyes widened in surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cassy has wrinkles on his forehead and corners of his eyes, which are thin and dense, but deep, and the surrounding skin becomes dull and rough, and the muscles of the cheeks are pulled. Down, on the sides of the mouth formed a distinctive figure-shaped line, she turned her face, Bonnie saw her neck, and her chin also appeared folds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie is desperately searching for her own memories, she does not remember seeing these disgusting little things - today, before this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
