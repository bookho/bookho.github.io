			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More news came - a family of six children came to a group of monkeys, they were noisy in the kitchen, Mr. Robert took his own The shotguns stopped them. He killed two monkeys, but the other monkeys scratched one eye and bit the three fingers. The whole face was bitten and bloody. Even so, he was still better than his wife. Fortunately, his wife was cracked by a big monkey, and the old Paul who came to the police told the sheriff almost in the teeth fight - how the monkeys dug the woman's intestines and entangled everywhere - - Just like a chaotic line of cats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, I will arrive as soon as possible, please wait in the place, don't leave." Sergeant Abel said to the microphone, tonight, he Say this to everyone who calls to call the police. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat down and opened a tabloid with more weight and more amazing content, which was brought to him by the understanding team leader, God I know that in the six months here, he has faded out of the birds below and above. He doesn’t accept anything that might cause “wrong thoughts.” Even jokes are not allowed, because most of them are related to sex. God is related, so in addition to the children's books in the library, the Bible, a supervised sect of the sect and the town itself, a book is not so much a newspaper as it is a mass and evangelistic timetable and advertising list. The only thing worth reading is probably the restaurant menu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The phone ringing constantly, Abel’s eyes are fixed on the half-naked blonde who squirms the waist and throws a winking eye, completely disregarding some The townspeople who have waited for more than half an hour and still haven't seen other people's shadows have turned their complaints and blame into curses and swearing. If it wasn't for his position, Abel would have been dragged out of the angry townspeople to feed the dangerous beasts that are raging in the town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no need for them anyway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This town has already solved more than a dozen of defectors for the institution. As the "technology" becomes more sophisticated, the appetite has become larger and larger. This is not the most annoying thing. What makes the organization most dissatisfied is that because the townspeople are self-righteous and do not know how to converge, some organizations and people outside have already paid attention to and stared at it. The unusual morning and evening here will be Some of the skeptical guys revealed that one is not good, and the organization has to follow the special treatment that is extremely exposed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are things that are done here for the defectors - not every defector is useless, they have some information needed by the institution And intelligence, some of the special ability, it is worth studying, and most of the townsmen returned are a pile of garbage... You know, the organization can be guided by this hidden suggestion, basically it will not be the action group. The spirits and the flesh are as tough as the state reserves. They still long for love, believe in friendship, look forward to family, have sweet illusions and true trust in this cold and strange world - they can hardly stand the hope. With a huge gap between disappointment and even despair, it is completely ruined by collapse and frenzy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agency originally hoped that it would become a hidden greenhouse, so that the little birds who made mistakes occasionally waited for the arrival of the hunters. The bird is considered a private object that can be manipulated at will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agency once issued a warning through Abel, but people in the town did not agree with it, and they even warned Abel in turn - they would put the institution and themselves The illegal trade is made public! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, they actually know it is illegal! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sheriff was amazed and turned over a newspaper. This page is a dark-skinned mulatto. Her chest is not as good as the previous one, but it can definitely be called a beautiful shape and a proper proportion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What makes him quite curious is how the townspeople here divide their thoughts and thoughts into the existence of the Great Rift Valley in East Africa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They think that the agency and their transactions are illegal, but they have not thought that they are part of this illegal transaction, and it is quite important - but this may not be anything Compared to the means by which they treat those "defectors" - their doctrine orders them not to lie, but every town citizen knows how to mislead and explain (for himself and for those who are strangers) In order to prevent the birds from entering the network from panicking and running around; their teachings also ordered them not to use sinful means to obtain benefits, but they can always find various reasons to capture the last banknotes of the fugitives. The last glimmer of strength; their teachings have even forced them to ** and must not harm others for no reason, so the people in the town are not allowed to divorce, do not allow for confession, are not allowed to find or do, never accept criminals, but they are happy In the last few days, vent their own rancid, dark and filthy desires on the goods they are about to hand over to the institution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are imprisoned, insulted, hurt, abused, raped their own kind, and proud of them, complacent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s strange that Sheriff Abel had seen the information before he came here, as the first defector who came here said. This town was once a poor and deserted place, but full of human touch and simple heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But from the second defector, a beautiful, intelligent and wealthy woman, all things began to show signs of derailment. Abel didn't know whether she took the first money on her own initiative or passively. She did the first job, but she accepted the first beating and insulting, even violent, but the institutions messed up the feathers and confused their brains. After the bird catches it, it’s an indisputable fact that the people in the town have changed their attitudes – they justifiably ask the institutions for various benefits, from interest-free loans to cash checks, from public facilities to personal welfare...and To ensure the safety of residents in the town, they require certain means to deal with those "criminals" under certain circumstances. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result is that every resident here has some banned weapons, from guns to knives, and they can treat those who defect as they wish. Anyway, as long as there is a "object" that can breathe and can talk and give it to the institution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sergeant Abel gently pressed his chin, or the madness of the townspeople came from this, in their minds, these guys who cast their own nets Can not be counted as human beings, they are the incarnation of sin, how to treat them as fugitives, and even the best venting products that will not be retaliated and prosecuted even if they are hurt and humiliated... In fact, if it is In the absence of any investigation, you should not mind to feel the wonderful taste of doing what you want, although this is a crime. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look, this is the difference. Abel thought, knowing that this is a crime, and knowing that he is not doing something good, but it is much better than those bastards who are clearly in the pit but still feel and purify themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They made Abel sick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The phone rang again. This time it was a school. A big boy who was in the midst of a change of voice screamed to Abel: Many tigers jumped into the school. They are eating people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abel’s phone was on the speaker, and an action group member jumped up involuntarily. Abel looked at it and repeated the words that had been repeated ten times today and hung up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He glanced at the man whose dress and eyes were basically normal, and he could understand his mind. After all, in the outside world, one has certain actions. When people who have the ability to hear a nearby school or a child who has been attacked by a beast, being indifferent or standing by is not one of their choices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No," Abel stood up and stood behind the coffee machine, making himself a cup of black coffee that was almost condensed, if it was something else. Tasks, yes, no problem, everyone is responsible for themselves anyway, but this time, the agency lost the entire five action group members in Ariau last time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the members of this time are selected, almost all veterans, regardless of ability, at least know how to obey orders, just to deal with the cruelty of those two means Crazy: "This mission does not include saving the world, Lord Savior," he sneered: "We are only responsible for capturing the devil."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are going to destroy this place, because the voice of sin in the city is great before the Lord, and the Lord sent us to destroy this place. ——Genesis<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest of the town is preparing for the mass of tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. Because of the rain, the celebration was interrupted, so the town residents decided to do it again. A glorious mass of thanksgiving to commemorate the saint who made a major sacrifice to the town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snowy white linen on the altar has been laid, the lily is dotted on the edge of the altar, leaving a large place to place the Gospel, and Where the sacred and holy plates are placed, perhaps a sacred box of sterling silver, a sacred body cloth, a holy blood cloth, a holy cover and a mass book, are also required to be placed in a collective donation by the townspeople. Location, maybe add an auxiliary altar? Now he needs to make a decision, is it to place a candle on the altar or on the altar? It seems appropriate to place it next to the altar, but the existing altar is not perfect. It is made of eucalyptus, and if possible, it should be made of other noble, strong materials – such as cherry wood? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, the town can get a new church, a new church with a new, beautiful stone altar, and The altar and other exquisite and beautiful things, but the priest can't see it because of his excellent "performance" (most of these performances come from the generous donations of the townspeople and the mass that must be held every few days) He got a chance to advance, and in a few days, he will leave for the central city of the parish to accept the blessing of the bishop and be awarded a new priesthood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may be the revelation of God, just as the angel urged Lot to go out with his wife and two daughters, lest he be annihilated because of the sin in Sodom. In that way, he will also leave here and leave the town that is more chilling than the day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest decided to put the candlestick on the auxiliary altar. He stepped back two steps to make sure the whole altar was perfect. After all, he was in this small town. The last mass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally he wanted to see his new attire, which was also the latest addition, hand-stitched by the nuns in the monastery of Saint Bernadette. It is made of bright red silk, with a gold cross stitch on the collar and the center of the front, with the same texture, and a beautifully embroidered tie. It is both beautiful and solemn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
