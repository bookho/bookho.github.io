			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine was quite rare and was not injured in the mission, but was sent to the infirmary one hour after returning to the institution, but fortunately the short-term electric shock would give It brought unimaginable pain, but the sequelae were not as serious as other injuries. After a series of timely and effective measures such as cooling, intravenous injection of salvage drugs, oxygen delivery, and assisted breathing, she opened the afternoon at about three o'clock in the afternoon. Eyes and unplugged the tracheal intubation. In comparison, Martin's situation is much worse. Catherine gave him an impressive nightmare. Although he is awake now, he is still as strong as depression, anxiety or tension, and everyone close to him. They will be attacked and refuse to communicate with anyone. The doctor can only judge that his spirit is extremely stimulated, but he cannot determine its extent and root cause. They have to give him an injection for a while, so that he can sleep safely. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What stimuli did you put on him?" Abel came to the condolences and was very good at the partner of the nest. The condolences were accompanied by a mozzarella. Smoked chicken breast sandwich with cheese, cucumber, tomato and egg white, and a cup of hot milk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine was already hungry, and although she had a splitting headache and numbness in her arms and shoulders, she couldn’t wait to bite a big bite on the beautiful triangle bread: "Abortion," she replied vaguely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Endosperm abortion?" Abel did not respond for a while, he did not understand what was studied with the embryo sac development and fertilization characteristics (in English, abortion Words can also be used to describe how pollination or endosperm failure fails. How can it pose such a big threat to Martin? He is almost crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No," Catherine washed the bread in her throat with milk: "It’s a small birth, a miscarriage, losing a child." She said peacefully. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abel stunned: "But he is a man!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So the effect is better." Catherine put down the cup and spread her hands hard: "Beyond women, men are less resistant to physical and mental stress. This is something that has been scientifically proven," she smiled scornfully: "Goodly Feel the taste of forcible hollowing out - maybe teach him how to treat other people's children."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aberdeen's doctor looks at the ceiling, he is now a bit Sympathetic poor Martin, from a spiritual point of view, he can apply for Guinness’s 200,000 yuan bonus. A man had a miracle nine years ago, successfully gave birth to a child, and now even abortion records are available. Broke it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abel coughed unnaturally, and he suddenly felt that Catherine was pretty good to himself: "If you feel better," he said: "Head I want to see you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine is the first time to go to the office . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of course does not refer to the real head of the organization, he is only responsible for this, but this is enough, he has a lot of power in his hand, enough to make him Cover and control all those who work and are working in the "Babel Tower" standing in the wilderness. He is about thirty-five to forty years old. He is tall and well-dressed. The blue eyes hidden behind the rimless glasses are very sharp, indifferent and even cruel. It is because of these eyes that people can put him and those well-dressed. Politicians, scholars, and Wall Street residents are coming in separately – that is the eyes that creatures at the top of the food chain will have. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please sit down." He said that Catherine sat down on the leather sofa opposite his desk, and the sun shone through the huge floor-to-ceiling windows, wrapped in a warm, soft blanket like Katherine, which felt comfortable. But Catherine can't easily get up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is perhaps a pattern in this office that makes her feel awkward - "Babel Tower" is an irregular reinforced concrete shaped column frame structure, thousands of deep into the rock The concrete columns and the beam structure that combines them form the skeleton of this giant. The distance between each column is between 20 feet and 30 feet. The office is a slender square that takes up laterally. The two pillars have four full lengths. The black sofa set that Catherine is waiting for is placed at one end of the office, and the desk at the other end is at the other end, separated by computer, printer, copier, scanner, and The projection screen, which occupies a quarter of the wall, has a silver bookcase, a marble table, a glass multi-layer cabinet, etc. - the head sits behind his desk and crosses his fingers. The window on his side was full of curtains, so that a small room was covered in artificial shadows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to talk to you, Catherine," said the head: "I think you want to talk to me too - Catherine, Martin Shaw The Ministry of Internal Affairs has complained that you have seriously hampered his investigation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that moment, Catherine felt that all her blood was pouring on her face and her head, her The eyes became hot and the lips trembled with anger. She took a few deep breaths to make herself less excited: "Seeing his ghost, it is not an investigation at all," she said. "He is looking for cockroaches."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not something you can define." The head replied calmly: "He has complete procedures, sufficient reasons, and permission."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can he still do that?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As long as I sign him."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You promised me," Catherine felt that her anger had exceeded the limit, and her voice creaked in her brain: "I finished the task, You guarantee his safety, someone will take care of him, meet his reasonable requirements, he will not have any unpleasant places."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I believe we have done it The head was soft but cold and said: "He got treatment - the best, someone cared for - twenty-four hours, asking for satisfaction - games, books and gardens, but Catherine, he is not an institution after all." The ward, but the person being monitored, dear, I believe that you can understand the difference between the two words - not just literally."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But what can a six-year-old child know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head smiled a little, "This can only be heard, Catherine, we In my heart, the only thing that Sasha Hopkins can call a childish place is his body. His brain and willpower are far beyond the children and even adults who are much older than him, and what he knows. Maybe more than we thought... Catherine, so far, Mr. Ghoul has killed and ate four innocent people and killed nearly a dozen members of the organization, including Jack, your former partner; even the scene has almost destroyed the misfortune of the entire Doug town. It is estimated that he can't get away with it...or that's what he made – these are just the things he committed in the re-emergence of the year – of course, I don't mean that we want his father to pay for it, This is unreasonable or legal, but we need all the clues, even if it is a dry description... We don't have much to let us find something about Anthony Hopkins, his resume, medical records, files. As early as seven years ago, your sister, FBI agent Catherine, had disappeared unconsciously when investigating; and the personal items that were of some use were basically in the junkyard, and my laptop was somewhere. Found at home, the jerk inside the private evidence is full of color. Love movies and boring adult games, even the best computer experts can hardly find a message that has been related to it; Only one was found to be sold to criminal collectors by his former guards (Lareniel, a Parisian cooking expert), and his corners have his own annotations. I have seen it, very interesting, but the problem is that these It is useless to our intelligence and action team members. He paused and made a gesture, and the voice became more gentle and gentle: "We can only find clues from him, Catherine, I have not given you a chance," he said to his thumb. : "I used to let Abel remind you to talk to Sasha. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
