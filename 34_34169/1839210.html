			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ps:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorry, because the previous chapters were in a hurry. Therefore, there are errors and conflicts in the number of chapters. I will ask the editors to help you to modify them tomorrow. Please forgive me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha lifted his body and pressed his hands on the lid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Undoubtedly, Besib is not an ordinary person. His strength is greater than that of a boy of the same age. The speed and endurance of running can surpass an adult. His ability to heal is also very strong. If it is not fatal, he can not need a doctor at all; he inherits the ability of Chegaler than Bissau. In the past three years of experiments and exercises, he was able to twist and deform as he pleased. The body can recover them afterwards, and he can also "swallow", but only for liquids such as wine, water, or soft things like bread, rice, cheese, etc. Fingers, on the edge of the plate and the mouth of the cup, the delicious food and drinks will disappear silently, and Old Andriana has been hurt for a long time, she thought she was Alzheimer's disease. He was about to go to the doctor, and he cried and submitted his resignation to "Tang". At this point, the little mischief of Besib was finally a paragraph. He did not want Old Andriana to leave them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disappointing, Besib doesn’t seem to be able to swallow knives and bullets as easily as Sangdi, exactly, any metal, rock, Soil, plastic products...nothing - Besib tried to "swallow" a scorpion, and finally Anthony Hopkins had to cut open his abdomen, so that the one firmly stuck in the liver Surface nuts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Celegal. Bissand and his Dr. Hopkins studied this question very carefully, they failed to draw any useful conclusions, The study of human beings is too shallow in the whole world. They can't figure out the fact that Besib is not yet mature or the ability has changed, just like Sasha Hopkins – the only one that can be clear That is, Besib. Bissau must stop using the ability to "swallow" before getting the most certain results. This news is not good. Another result that followed was not bad, and Chekal Bissand would probably not want children any more in recent years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Besib’s ability to deform is far less than that of his father. His deformation is limited. For now, he can’t use his. The deformation ability is out of danger, the cover of the water tower is not completely sealed, but the gap is only one inch less. Before Sasha came, Besib had already tried it, and he was able to extend the arm out of the slit. The big arm can't, let alone the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The life jacket has dried up to only a third of its thickness, and the water-soaked clothing and shoes pull him down. Besib's ears were filled with water. He struggled to raise his head and let his nose out of the water. The water rippled and poured in. I slipped out for a while. His brain commanded his arms to lift, his legs swayed, they moved, but they were slow and terrible, and the drugs that invaded his brain were still working, and the conversation with Sasha exhausted his last strength. His eyes can't open, he is eager to sleep, even if death is followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The width of the gap limits the view of Sasha. But he can see that things have reached an extremely urgent moment without looking. Sasha quickly estimated the time when the teacher with the key could arrive, and the iron bar that was indefatigable... He could not guarantee that he would be safe and secure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bishb," he said, "wake up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few years later Sasha Hopkins still remembers the power he had used in the Tower of Babel. That power is coming from the wind. The rushing power, the pleasure of controlling everyone's thoughts and body in the palm of his hand, he remembers clearly, he knows that it can save the life of Besib, but his father is not with him, he does not know Can you find the door, and you can't close it after opening the door. He doesn't even know if there will be too much power in the door. It will make Besib a complete monster. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Help me, father." Sasha muttered, his fingers on the cold lid, his thoughts entered a misty white Fog, his feet can't reach the real ground. He wants to go forward, back, but can't find a fixed point. He is suspended in the void space, not up and down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Hopkins opened his eyes, an affectionate and urgent The sound awakened him. He groped for the pendant on his chest, which contained photos and hair of Sasha Hopkins. The moonlight shone from the skylight and shone on his pale face, the ghoul reddish brown. The eyeballs are like frozen blood clots, and the black pupils are rapidly becoming larger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha. Hopkins’s thought was gently pulled, A line of cymbals whispered in front of him, the line rolled forward, his body followed, and he saw the door. He raised his hands and grabbed the handle, and the threshold did not move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other hand covered his hand. The hands were stronger than him. They were bigger than him. The door was opened. The dazzling light overflowed. It was stronger than the previous one. Sasha felt it was like a knife. He splits into two, and then rushes forward from his separate body, and he never returns. His temperature, strength and life seem to go with it. Sasha Hopkins trembled uncontrollably, and the hands came back and hugged his body. His familiar lips fell and kissed his eyes, cheeks and nose. "You are afraid of it... No," the familiar voice said: "You don't have to fear it at all, it is your power, it It belongs to you, it obeys you, you are its sole master, the only controller, it will never hurt you, even if it is one point."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Look," the voice continued, "Open your eyes and look."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha bowed his head, he saw the light of the river, the warm light from Passing through his body, cheering and jumping, he likes to win, they surround him, docile and well-behaved, like the lambs surrounding their shepherds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Close the door, it is enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha's hands are once again grasped The handle, the light that still stagnate at that end, whispers, "Oh," Sasha said. "One day, I will let you out." The voice disappeared and he closed the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishb saw the light, "Don't..." He sadly Hey: "I haven't wanted to go to heaven yet." He desperately mobilized the power in his body that he might have, but he didn't use it. Light penetrates into his body, his body becomes warm, his comfort is heard, harmful things are expelled, the ability to hide in the flesh and blood is awakened, they are galloping in blood vessels and muscles, and they can’t wait Rushing to the outside world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gap between the lids stretched out the black fingers of Besib, the fingers instantly became flat, and it "flowed" along the lower edge of the lid, behind The shape is almost invisible. It can only be said to be very similar to a dark raw pizza dough or melted chocolate ice cream... Sasha let a little bit of position, "thin ice" swaying in the breeze, clinging to the top of the ladder. They gradually merged together, and the two raised parts moved and opened, and Besib’s eyeball rolled in and out, followed by the nose. Then the mouth - white teeth touched the iron railings, squeaking, tongue sticking out from the middle of the teeth, screaming: "...call," Besib said: "Sasha, help." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha reached out. There was still a little power left in his body, and it flowed over, and the nakedness of Besib appeared - he took a sip. I sweared the most vulgar swear words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, brother." He said, leaning over his face and giving Sasha a loud kiss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishb bowed down and checked the lock on the lid. He noticed that the iron rod that was not on the lock was hit by a heavy object, and it was bent. This way, even if the administrator brings the key, there is no way to open the lid at one and a half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took the iron rod and his arm suddenly became soft - soft enough to wrap around the iron rod for several laps, even if the Hercules did not necessarily The iron rod that could be pulled out in a moment was pulled out at once, and Besib did not stop. The iron rod was inserted into the gap of the lid, and it touched like a soda bottle cap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishib opened the lid, the water rippled, his entire suit and the life jacket that had been completely dying floated inside, he jumped, picked up the clothes to wear There are also life jackets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a shout under the water tower, someone turned on the light and ran upstairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One head first appeared on the small iron ladder leading to the water tower, the white beard and hair were very conspicuous, and he looked at the mess in front of him: "God, here What happened?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“As you can see,” Sasha said, “I saved my friend.”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole thing is boiled down to an accident. Inadvertently out of the conventional pranks - no one thought that life jackets would leak, they just want new members to enjoy the coolness and ampoules of the water tower, just a few hours, he will only get a cold at most. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old players of the football team got a violation list and were caught in their transcripts. They will be affected in the future application for the university, and they will be deducted. This year's credits. But that's it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doctor Douglas thought he would see two angry faces, he was disappointed, neither Besib nor Sasha showed anything, especially the face They just looked very tired, nestled in their suites, and rested for a few days. The school certainly agreed that Mr. Neek told them that their credits would not be deducted, and teachers in various subjects would try. Help them make up the lessons that fall during the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
