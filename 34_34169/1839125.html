			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hop Hopkins watched Anne Kent leave, the little girl had previously appeared to inadvertently show that she wanted to dine with them on the same table. Will, but both Big Hopkins and Little Hopkins subtly ignore this suggestion, lunch is limited to their private time, and in private time, this is different from the ordinary father and son The "third party" is definitely not welcome. But we don't have to worry about Anne anymore. She is very popular in the class and even in the whole school. In a short while, a group of little boys and girls holding various lunch boxes and standard lunch plates surrounded her; amazing. Yes, Dolores, this rude and rude little girl actually has her supporters. The number is small, but it can be seen that they are all naughty ghosts. They used less than five minutes to fill their stomachs, and then began to sing and scream the lines in the movie, before the teacher had time to stop the fries and fruits. The pieces were thrown into the air, some fell into their mouths, and more stuck to their hair and clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also children looking at Sasha here, but when Sasha looks past, they will immediately go back and stare at their plates without saying a word. It’s not like being annoying, it’s like being shy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lot of wonderful things, so that Sasha can't help but be curious about the strange time that his father had had. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s worse, more confusing, more unbearable, but more fun and convenient.” Dr. Hopkins replied that the child was in the second After the World War, it began to receive attention. The Law of Protection was officially established in the 1970s. The public schools of 40 years ago were full of teachers, harsh regulations and various corporal punishments. The seniors were in the lower grades. The bullying of the weak is considered a game between children. Fortunately, Anthony Hopkins, who was enrolled at the time, has gained enough "knowledge" and "experience" in the orphanage. He recalled for a while and decided to return the topic to the previous one: "The trouble brought by you has been with me for a long time - four months of babies know how to squat, they will be in the caregiver to hug other babies When you cry, the children’s jealousy is not much different from the adult’s jealousy. If there is anything different, it’s probably that the children will put them on their faces and actions. The adults know themselves. Consolation, restraint and forbearance... In fact, jealousy is the most common and deep-rooted emotion of human beings. If you are willing to trace the roots, you will find that it is not selfish, but selfishness is the survival and reproduction of human beings. One of the necessary elements. Look," Dr. Hopkins added a little vegetable juice to Sasha: "As Mr. Darwin said, the survival of the fittest, the natural choices - big, beautiful, healthy, smart, always get More and better food, utensils, shelter; then, what about small, fragile, ugly and stupid? They have to live and want to breed themselves. Later generations, then... since you can’t make yourself better, let the better get worse, become equal or even worse with yourself... as long as the ability allows, they will do it, it’s not sin (although In the thirteenth century, the priest of the TD, St. Domus Aquinas, did list a place in the performance of bad deeds. It was just an instinct. Although there is no doubt that if left unchecked, this kind of emotion will lead to the entire human society. Stopping. But there are always things that people know badly but can never be abandoned."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s easy to solve this problem...the list is too numerous to enumerate. Dr. Hopkins is eager to persuade, just like encouraging his children to play a baseball or participate in a calligraphy competition, or more accurately, an adult beast pushing the cub with his nose and letting it face. For the first prey of his life, Sasha has confronted hostile adults more than once, but this time it is his first real confrontation with human beings. Minors are a good choice - children's emotions are the best. Identification and control , Like pH test paper, rapid, sensitive, accurate, and once the change will never return to its original look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The memory of childhood can directly affect the decades to come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ghoul paused and held his lips with a fork. He suddenly remembered Mason, who was placed on the second floor of the memory palace. The arrogant guy started to invite the slum children to his manor after he was smothered to cut his face and feed the dog with a rope and broke the half of his neck. His body did not allow him to go out. He only let the assistants These children brought him in front of him, he threatened them in the dark, then the assistants collected gauze soaked in the tears of the children, and dipped the salt in the frozen horseskin so that he could drink it; A little boy in a small passenger plane, a rare child who likes liver-mud sausages; or a young Catherine, she is hiding behind the mildewed planks... the lights in the slaughterhouse are bright and the blood is hot everywhere. Rogue, the white lamb screams... Did she think she would be one of them? Or... Dr. Hopkins closed his mind agilely, just as he slammed a door—and he almost opened the cellar that spit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new teacher of black hair turned his attention back to his children. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha is enjoying a fat foie gras sandwich, the rosy cheeks are bulging, Hopkins’s craftsmanship is good, he uses apple brandy and truffles Ingredients, small fire slightly fried, only turned over once, the meat is fresh and tender, the aroma is tangy, and there is no liver sputum and bitterness at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a lot of ways to get rid of others. The simpler one is to hide your own excellence - Hopkins determines that Sasha will not choose this In this way, Sasha will not despise IQ or emotional control than his own, but this does not mean that he is willing to accept the inferiority of the former; then another method...that is, the opposite is the inevitable The first choice - you can be better, better, until the height of others can not be reached no matter how hard ... 嫉妒 always with the competition, there is no hope that the fruit will not be smashed, like a cockroach will not Going to Her Majesty the Queen of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, he will only go to the streets of two streets, because he is more successful in begging (even if it is just a few more coins). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, you can do nothing, but I suggest you try it." Dr. Hopkins blinked at Sasha: "It will be very Interesting, I promise."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins’s prediction is correct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he expected, Sasha chose the latter method, not just classrooms, playgrounds and extracurricular activities, but also the main day school became the Streif home. Where the child shines, a quarter of a school year, he gets full marks every month in written homework, classroom manners, playground cleanliness and self-discipline, never absent from work or late and early leave, every week from the Sunday school ( Most of the lessons of the believer's children in the church on Sunday are reciting the Bible and the biography of the saints. The teacher has a seal that symbolizes the perfection of the course. In addition, he also participated in the Spanish competition and got a trophy for St. Thomas Primary School. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher likes him, and the children like him. Girls like Sasha Streif, because he is beautiful, clean, gentle, whether it is mathematics, foreign language, reading or manual, there is a good achievement worthy of envy; boys like him because of Sasha. Although Streiff looks like a soft girl, his fists are hard enough and his legs and feet are fast enough - he never refuses the invitation of the boys "small game", but he has never been caught. It really deserves to be worshipped, isn't it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s Dolores. Kent is still looking for something from time to time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha still thinks she is very cute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the new school year after September, Mr. Streif will be responsible for the new third grade, four classes, and Sasha and other students will enter the fourth grade of the fourth grade. Continue to be responsible for Mr. Humbert alone. The classrooms of Sasha and other students also changed from "Saint Badodo, who became a tanning protector because of being peeled off," to "The Virgin of the Lord's Lady". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the last Friday before the summer vacation, Sasha was informed and Mr. Humbert needed to talk to him alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is nothing." Notifier Anne Kent comforted: "Just every routine of the school year, Mr. Humbert is a responsible good man, he will and each The students all talked like this.” Before leaving the classroom, the girl smiled slightly: “Maybe he is a bit harsh, but it’s all for you.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now third grade In the four classes of classrooms, there were only Mr. Humbert and Sasha Streif. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Hembert waited in the classroom office area, where only one screen was separated from the teaching area. When Sasha passed by, he couldn't help but glanced at it. There was a small blackboard behind the screen, and there was still a vague point on it. This made Sasha think of the same scene that he saw when he first entered St. Thomas. Only one little girl with a nose pointed at the chalk point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Today Dolores is very well-behaved." Mr. Humbert also noticed this, he opened his mouth and revealed a thick smile, "Please sit. Mr. Little Streif, don't be nervous, just a little private conversation." He owes a chair in his chair (the chair makes a squeaking sound), takes out a piece of chocolate from the drawer, "Chocolate?" After shaking his head, Sha said that he refused to put the chocolate into his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It won't delay you a lot of time." Mr. Humbert, who swallowed chocolate, said, absent-mindedly stroking the armrest of the chair: "Mr. Streif The same is true in the future. This is the tradition of the school,” he shrugged at Sasha. “We have the right and obligation to understand the situation of each student.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp He rolled over a 16-page memo and turned his eyes up slightly. "So we started?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is indeed a bit boring Talking, how is the school, how are the classmates, how are the teachers, the places for extracurricular activities, how is the school on Sunday? Sasha thought that such problems would continue until the end of the conversation, but after about fifteen minutes, Sasha was keenly aware that Mr. Humbert’s topic was gradually moving closer to the private domain of “Straef”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is your neighbor?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha gave Mr. Humbert, Every wrinkle on his face is a manifestation of the master's seriousness, and his eyes are pure like a baby. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We have no neighbors," Sasha replied: "Our house is a little far from other people in the community."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, that is, you can't play with your neighbor's children... Does Mr. Streif allow you to go out and play?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I prefer to be with my father."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"噢...So, the question may not be very pleasant, Sasha, you still remember your own Mother? If I am not mistaken, your mother has been away from you for two years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
