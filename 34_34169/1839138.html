			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avery is an extremely mischievous boy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was evenly divided with her when Dolores had not left St. Thomas, and after Dolores left, she received all her legacy. "Power", even to Sasha. Streif, from time to time to find some trouble, this tradition has been well inherited, and even there is a great disappointment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Isn't it? Look at what day is today, September 8th, the birth of the Virgin Mary, if it is the past St. Thomas, such a celebration is just a collection of the teachers and students of the whole school to the Virgin to dedicate the rosary, lily, chanting the corresponding verses; But this year, perhaps in order to get rid of the shadows of various accidents during the summer vacation, Mrs. Boro’s initiative and generosity, in the name of “Celebration of the Virgin and the Day of the Celebration”, the joint manager and some members of the Parent Teacher Association They hosted a small-scale park tour; as with the school day, students and teachers have their own tasks, and religious dramas that are a great tool for the St. Thomas Church Primary School are equally essential – given Sterling Mr. Lef’s selfless help during the chaotic summer vacation, Mrs. Boro’s reciprocity, and Sasha Streif became the main actor of the religious drama. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The repertoire is based on the “information of the abortion”, with the help of the story of the angel Gabriel and the Virgin in the religious story (although not the most appropriate, but on the day of the birth of the Virgin This day, there must be something related to it.) Sasha Streif was appointed to play the hand-held lily, and the angel Gabriel, who came to the virgin to convey the decree to the Virgin Mary, was given a burst of admiration. - Doesn't it mean that he has excellent acting skills, religious dramas, especially the religious dramas taken from the Bible, there is almost no room for actors to play, even the lines must be read in full accordance with every letter of the Gospel. Punctuation - The first thing that caught people's attention was his looks and demeanor. What a lovely and calm child! Of course, as human beings, they can't compare them to real angels, but at the moment when Sasha Treff came out, almost no one could think that other children would be better suited to him than him. - The reason why it is said for a moment, but because people's selfishness is at work, after all, most of the people here are the parents of the students of St. Thomas Church Primary School - in terms of emotion, everyone will only feel themselves The best child is the best. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is his costume, Mr. Streif declined the goodwill of others - Sasha certainly can’t use that kind of being changed around, no Knowing to whom and even the animals are going through the rental costumes, Streif does not trust the crafts of others. Although he has only done diapers for the time being, he believes that sewing will not be smaller than the miniatures in the Persian palace or It is said that the long-lost Junnie language is more complicated and difficult to master. The fact is the same. He used his old-fashioned foot on a sewing machine (that was, the former "Bison Bill" used to make a milk/skin vest. I was groping for two nights and finally knew what was wrong with it. Mr. Streif, who is familiar with history, art and religion, took inspiration from a painting by Ludo Vikko Karachi of Italy instead of Da Vinci, and chose a pearly luster. The light-weight light lotus-red thin-spun silk has made a large robes with no collar and long sleeves for the children. The golden silk embroidery belt from the waistband to the cuffs, the front chest and the hem is meticulously reproduced. Then he made a pair of small Gabriel wings as shown in the figure - thousands of yellow, yellow, wool, white, ivory, moss, green, coral, gray, gray, green, and dyed feathers, they are like clouds Gently cover the child's shoulders and back, because the inside uses a slender and elastic whale-holding relationship, the two wings will be vigorously swinging when walking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Boro praised this and was full of hope for this religious drama. Even the most lawless children did not dare to sweep the interest of this old woman at this time; so the prank happened in the curtain call. Later, after returning to the classroom that was temporarily used as a locker room, Sasha Streif, who was preparing to change back to the shirt trousers, found that his clothes were gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can continue to wear your pretty little dress!" Avery stood in the corridor outside the classroom and shouted, proud, he was a weight A full-fledged little fat man, one can occupy one-half of the entire corridor. "But it's awkward, right?" He said with a sloppy accent with a trace of midnight movies: "The useless sands of the dripping Little girls..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boys behind him laughed like a chicken that was stuck in the neck, a boy of ten years old. Still staying at the stage of putting caterpillars on the girl's nephew, but I already know how to deal with the potentially popular enemy, especially if the enemy never "bulls" the girl and makes him more likable. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha walked out of the classroom, and the ends of the feathers flapped on the sides of his back. I am too lazy to care about what the naughty are saying - the father is right, the children's memory is very poor, he remembers that he had talked to them before the summer vacation - with his tongue, and more, Use your fist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The children of the Streif family turned their eyes calmly and ordered their number, one, two, three, four... a total of five It is not difficult to cope. "Little girl Sasha" said nothing, tightened her muscles, and it took only a few seconds to rush to the boys - the boys were really surprised and had no time to make it right. The reaction - Avery's chin was pushed up by him, the fat boy lost his balance, waving his hands and swaying backwards, and the boy next to him, one was stabbed by Sasha. The foot, he was slammed into the wall, and the other one who was bent over and flashed when attempting to swing his fist, a solid elbow knocked under the rib, and he immediately yelled; the third was Sasha stretched out and fell, and the fourth person was tired. They hugged each other close to each other and fell to the ground. Sasha jumped up and stood on the shoulder of the fat man. The weight of an eight-year-old boy said. Light and light, the weight is not heavy, the guy at the bottom immediately made a painful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha jumped from the two overlapping backs, the fifth boy was nearly one head taller than Sasha, but he immediately rushed out of his bag Turning out the entangled clothes into the original owner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you." Sasha said: "In addition, this is not a skirt, and it will not hinder the feet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha ran into the classroom with his clothes, but The boy’s bad luck did not move away from his footsteps. When they were squatting and helping each other to get up, another person came from the end of the corridor—the boys must pray in their hearts. She didn’t see anything, but unfortunately, neither God nor the Virgin Mary were online, young and beautiful, the new female teacher bent down and checked their situation to determine the previous accidents. After giving them a slight bruise, she sighed a little: "Tomorrow, the day after tomorrow and the day after noon, come to my office." She said softly and dearly: "Copying the first book of Peter. Every "People again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fair, Teacher Kemira," said Avery, a little fat man: "We didn't do anything, accurately, yes. Sasha Streif beat us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nb Sp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!" the boys shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I saw it," the female teacher nodded with a smile: "One beat you four."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boys have no sound at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I punish you not because of this," said Teacher Kemira. "I punish you...because you discriminate against women. 'The useless sprinkles Sha Xiaoniang?'" She vividly imitated Avery's tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's it." In the screams of the boys, she blinked and said she had made a final judgment - dismissing all appeals . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kimilla has a pair of bright, round, large eyes, deep greenish iris, deep eyeliner, eye-catchingly slightly picking, like a Only a variant of Jinji Lapos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boys are licking their noses and suddenly feel that the consequences may not be bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kimilla also wants to change clothes, she plays the Virgin Mary The costumes sponsored by Mrs. Boro, the white variegated linen blouse and the dark blue embroidered robe that resembles the old-fashioned costumes worn in the masses, stacked in layers, are like the Aegean Sea. The bubble is surrounded by young education interns like Venus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wearing at least 20 pounds of clothes in this body, she is difficult to walk, let alone participate in the next dance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changed clothes, when she passed the classroom, she was slightly surprised to see that "Little Gabriel" was still stuck between the desks and chairs, she curiously walked Recently, I found that this child, who is as stable as an adult (except for some special moments), is squinting his shirt, but it must be in vain. The shirt is cotton silk, and it has been wrinkled like a dry kelp after being stuffed into a schoolbag. The hands alone are not flat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked at it for a while and finally decided that her son might not look like a father - Kemira came a few days, and Streiff Mr. is just a nod, but Mrs. Boro is very talkative. Kemira knows where the robes that the boys call "fair skirts" come from. It is said that Mr. Streif is still a Excellent chef and gardener - Little Streif has a lot of power in this area compared to his father. It can even be said to be clumsy. Kemira watched him get the shirt worse (she couldn't understand) Why did the boy put the shirt on the desk, did he think that he could flatten the clothes?), and finally couldn't stand it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I brought a portable iron," she raised a hand and gently suggested, "Let me help you, little angel, others are still Waiting outside for us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha Streif, who was preparing to summon his father, paused. He thought about it and retired from the desk. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hold this." Kemira said, giving his costume to Sasha, the soft and warm cloth immediately drowned the child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha heard a slight sneer, completely unable to resist, no malice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sit there, from one to one thousand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kimilla said, Remove the black folding iron from your bag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Streiff and Mrs. Boro saw this Scenes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, it’s wonderful, isn’t it?” Mrs. Boro said happily, and she picked up the slenderly portrayed Mr. Streif. eyebrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
