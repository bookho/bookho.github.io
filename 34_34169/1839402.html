			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Isn't this a good thing?" Besib said, know that Meyare Bissand is "Tang. Chegal has changed." In the name of becoming a devil, the rebellion was provoked. Even Chekal’s most trusted iron hoe was convinced by him. If Chekale does not have such a powerful and deliberate ability, he may have died in his own bodyguard. And the nephew’s men’s hands, this is why today’s Chegale always does not believe in the relationship of ordinary people, put it in five hundred, no, three hundred years ago, they will be caught by the feared villagers and tied to the cross to live. Burned to death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope is willing to say this, it is good for the abilities. At least some of the devout families will not imprison and beat them because their children have become abilities, trying to drive away the devils on them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He guarantees that weakness will not be harmed, but at the same time it also guarantees that those who are strong will not be respected," Sasha said, while closing the book Put it on your knees: "Think about it, remember Stefan's ability? As long as he has a book, he can follow the book to do all kinds of saints and saviors. He can Walking on the water, you can also pass the flame without being burned. He can also dispel the disease, restore the broken limbs, rejuvenate and regain youth. He is a visible, touchable living saint, if not the Pope. Adhering to his ideas and views, and having a large number of supporters, he has long been the Messiah that people worship. For more than a thousand years, there have been many Messiahs, and they have nothing but rhetoric. This is the case, and there are still countless people who are willing to follow them and willingly dedicate their property and life. So what if Stefan became the new Messiah? He also has a Stranya. Each last name. He or It will become the Pope, but this is not the worst. The worst thing is that his sect will replace the existing church. The foundation of the Vatican will be shaken by the glory of the Savior, and the faith of hundreds of millions of people will collapse. The turmoil of the rescue - I was not joking - fortunately these were stopped in time, so what we are seeing now is not the sage Stefan, but the actor Stefan."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But those who pursue him are also wearing the bishop's red dress."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Pope also has enemies, and both These pigs have pig brains," Sasha commented vaguely. "They want to pick up Stefan as a shield and a rifle, but they have to look at the Pope's permission. Hey, Stefan is not sent back again. Is Trojan? My father told me that someone is preparing to elect Stefan to be a saint, but he was rejected. The president’s amnesty also wrote his name.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it really killing those children?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know the details," Sasha said. "His mind is very strong. In the federal investigation." During the interrogation process between the bureau and the organization, he rarely answered questions, did not admit it, and did not deny it. They have not been able to find the whereabouts of the children until now, whether they are dead or alive, but he once said those children and Messiah. ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He thinks you are the Messiah." Besib said: "I hate this, he wants to kill you?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't seem to be. But I think there will be such a day sooner or later," Sasha said. "He seems to be waiting for something."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stefan’s recent dreams are getting more and more frequent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The fruit is about to mature." He said: "The human catastrophe is coming."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The golden lamb becomes weak and weak, and the mountain-like bone line can be clearly seen on the back of the ridge. It is so difficult when breathing. When inhaling, the skin of the abdomen is close to the ribs of the strip. The sun-like hair becomes dull and unkempt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even without it, the sacred hall is still chaotic and broken - the light is dim. The slabs on the ground cracked like gaps in the veins of the plants, and the gaps were deep. There is cold wind blowing from below to the top, and the wind is mixed with red dust. With the smell of metal and blood, once it falls on the accounts and walls, it is difficult to wipe off - there is no water in the baptismal pool, only the rolling black mud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The altar remains as it is, waiting for the sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the worst time. In the first few times, the splendid temple was also filthy, but as long as the offerings...<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stefan didn’t know what to do at first, but he always got inspiration, like the saints and martyrs—a winter morning, he saw In the golden color, the child took the mother's skirt and walked into the church. The little golden curls, his eyes were as quiet as the eyes of the lamb. He looked at Stefan, the human child who would never have helplessness and sorrow. - So Stefan knew what he was going to do. He took the child, cut his throat and placed it on the altar of the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he said that he was still hesitant at the beginning, what happened next was really confirming that the instructions he had received came from heaven - the child's blood was white, light, and then he It disappeared, and the linen cloth on the altar was as clean as new, leaving no trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That night he returned to the temple, the temple was shrouded in light, and the golden lamb smashed his murderous hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Give me all this sin," said Stefan, "I am going to hell."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stroked the head of the lamb. There were two small horns like screws on the top of the lamb. It was lying on the ground quietly, and the long eyelashes covered its cobalt-blue color. Above the eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are the Messiah," said Stefan: "I will return the power you lost to the world to you as soon as possible - you have important Work to do, I know - but you have to wait, wait... but won't wait too long."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you waiting for?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Equivalent to Libica's prophecy." Samuel said that he is an old man, "Samuel" was built by him, and the main reason for establishing it lies in Libica. prophecy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can stay in the organization, and with his qualifications and abilities, he can occupy a very good position on the tip of the pyramid, but if Libica’s prophecy is Really, then he can't touch that person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What does Mr. Li say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is very annoyed," subordinate of Samuel Happily said: "They got the benefits of locusts, so they have to suffer from the disadvantages. They are now eliminating the suspicions and anger of those people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I don't care about the organization," Samuel said. "As long as we have another 20 years, we can see a new generation of abilities. They are standing behind their families, they will replace institutions, and we will ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
