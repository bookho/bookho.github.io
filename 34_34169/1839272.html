"But if it's just quick and powerful, everyone here is - except for the two (she shrugged at Judah and Sean), and he is very old." She spread the playfully: "apparently unattractive - not just for me - is he? Is there any hidden light in my body that I still haven't noticed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No doubt," the control system allows those monitoring probes to turn around. The big boy looking for the target said with a smile: "Hopkins is the 'new darling' of the institution."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe, I mean, Sasha. Huo Pugins, he is an angel." The girl said, she took off her shoes, lifted one foot restlessly, put it on the table, and the black taffeta skirt slid down and people saw it. The girl’s unique rounded knees are slim and strong compared to mature women. She is almost a kind of uncomfortable The attitude of the heart shows her body to every male present: "As long as he does not turn me into a shit that is melting under the sun."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course not," said the boy. "Catherine is not good now. To be honest, I think she is a little thinner than anything else."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "She is too old." Lila sighed in her nose. "Put the lens closer and you can see the skin on her neck like a used napkin." She commented succinctly. Put down the leg and change another one, but this time she didn't put it on the table - the sofa back is also a good place to show, the big toe with the purple nail polish is only five inches from the head of the "head" Not at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will cut it down." "Head" said, Lila pouted, but immediately moved away - still on the sofa But, at least it is not the kind of distance that can be caught by reaching out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said earlier, Lila," the boy said with gloating: "The 'head is not a pedophile. He doesn't like small dolls."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Head" groped for a moment in his pocket, finding two pieces of pure chocolate that he didn't like very much, and throwing them each one, which is a hint Lila and the boy closed their mouths. The boy turned his attention back to the monitor screen - Anthony Hopkins's face and hand screenshots were taken by him to make a small program, and the computer was automatically searched frame by frame for each of the vast surveillance videos, each The faces and hands of Anthony Hopkins will be placed in a folder - but unfortunately, there are very few that can come in handy, and the most critical part is covered by the diffuse white mist. They can only see the last few seconds. At that time, it was already done. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big boy yawned. He also doesn't understand why "institutions" are so jealous and cautious about Anthony Hopkins - the power and danger of the abilities are only for ordinary people, especially after they are exposed, simply hit a For example. They are no different from ordinary people with guns. They need to eat, need to breathe, need to excrete and sleep, and have all kinds of * and hobbies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Awareness of the abilities of the abilities in the country. To be correct, the harm (to be honest, the benefits are negligible) is enough to affect the whole society. The ropes around the fingers of the abilities are suddenly tightened. Now there are not only "hunters" who are also abilities. The police, the FBI and even the military have also begun to be interested in the abilities - they want to control every actor. Uncontrollable, they don't mind getting rid of it - in the face of the country's violent machines, the powerful abilities are just a poor little bug. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Head" did not speak. Even if there are no "outsiders" (Shaun Battier and Judah), the boy and Lila are not qualified to know what he knows - "Institution" wants to know Anthony Hopkins, especially his ability. But not just because of "he". Anthony Hopkins is ultimately a personal class, a human with power. Even if he ate a whole tyrannosaurus, it is not worth the organization's attention to him. His preciousness comes from another side - his son. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we said before, when the abilities and an ordinary person have children, their children have a 50% chance of being an abilities. The descendants of the abilities and the abilities of the abilities are necessarily the abilities. Their descendants have a 50% chance of inheriting the abilities of the father or the mother, but there are also very small possibilities. The ability is a combination of the abilities of both parents - today's institutional researchers are curious as to this, Anthony Hopkins has never revealed his traits, in fact, in the abilities When it has not yet appeared in large numbers, from his archives, people can only see an elegant, powerful, agile, gentle, and demon-minded demonic. In the years that followed, people began to wonder if the Ghoul was also The abilities, his file was copied and transferred to the "institution", but unfortunately, the "Ghoul" had escaped the double pursuit of law and self-interest, with the former FBI agent. Katherine is not unexpectedly selling The sound disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he appeared again, there was Sasha Hopkins around, this blond-eyed child was indeed Katherine and Anthony Hopkin斯's - Anthony Hopkins's hair with hair follicles left in psychiatric hospitals and prisons many years ago, saliva and the DNA provided by Catherine's sister Catherine proved this - the researchers from Catherine The memory of her sister Catherine and the genes speculate that Catherine should also be an invisible person who focuses on emotional use. Her son does not seem to be able to inherit her ability - this is a good thing, Sasha Hope Kings's ability is more rare, more outstanding, and more precious than Catherine or Catherine, and he is very young and very young. This ability has the potential and space to enhance and expand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a time when researchers thought that Sasha Hopkins’ ability was inherited from his father—Anthony Hopkins’s actions broke this perception, although it’s still not clear. However, as far as their existing information is concerned, Big Hopkins's abilities are likely to be attack-type. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "head" received this order: I hope he can understand Anthony Hopkins a little deeper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, but, yes, they don't recommend or hope that the "head" uses something that is too intense or obvious. There is only one Sasha Hopkins for the time being. He deserves to be taken care of, from the body to the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ghoul" is not a good-tempered guy, "head" thinks, he sincerely hopes that he will not go to Anthony Hopkins Going to the stomach to do a so-called "deep understanding". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Head" was a little annoyed and threw a sugar into his mouth. When he bit his teeth, he found that he forgot to peel off the wrapping paper and wrapped it. Soft buttered toffee and wax paper are mixed together. He raised his hand to block his face, and no one noticed that his face was suddenly gloomy—not for the sake of toffee—and he thought of a possibility, a possibility for him to think of vomiting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Abel stood up," the boy said. "It looks safe and sound. Do you think he might see what Hopkins did?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is in the wrong position and there are too many obstacles." The boy said that Abel’s choice was very good, because it was very good, so the bullets flew. At that time, he could only grab an injured "Northern Donkey" - his body was blocked by dark gray explosion-proof armor for a moment, and the next bullet left more than one pit on it, and then he Hidden into the curtain - the whole process is like magic, the boy looked at it over and over again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We should ask Catherine." Lila said: "Catherine's position is very close."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I don't think she can say anything," the boy said. "Many people are saying that Catherine is interested in that 'ghoul'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Don't be kidding," Lila took back the leg that had been resting on the sofa copy: "Catherine loves her sister, she is a homosexual - Hopkins killed her sister, she hated him."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
