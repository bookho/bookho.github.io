			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is still closed, and the monster that has been banned has already woken up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As always, it stands quietly, eyes open, neither in reality, nor in fantasy, hot, white and bright eyes watching The door, the door is still tightly closed, and there is no gap left, but it can detect that one of the shackles has been loosened, human desires, greed, ignorance and the emotions accompanying them are infiltrating, small voices. Hey, continuous, lingering, "We need you." Those voices said: "We need you, need you, need you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Messiah."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about it, the monster said, "I don't need you." It opened his mouth as if a smile was revealed: Although I don't mind going out occasionally."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power is out of control, though The door was not opened, but the liquid or atomized light was flowing out from it, and the little Hopkins was low. Head, forced to hold down his chest, like this will be able to curb its proliferation - but this is really too hard to be any more difficult than the previous one. This is perhaps one of the toughest levels he has ever had in his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was compulsibly trapped in the sleep paralysis phase (sleep paralysis stage) - in order to prevent the action in the dream from reacting to reality, once humans enter the deep sleep stage The sports center will be shut down. Only the eyes and eyelids can move. But in many cases, the human consciousness will wake up before the body. They are awake, but they can only turn the eyeball, tremble the eyelids, or even open their eyes. Fingers, and most of them will be accompanied by hallucinations... shattered sounds, blurred shadows, etc... or. The scent of wild rose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smell of wild rose is getting more and more intense. For the first time, Sasha couldn’t estimate how long he could hold on. He heard the roar of Besib, ambiguous. Unclear. He wants to let Besib leave. If it is as he speculates, he will not suffer too much damage, but Besib may not be, even if there is no other person, it belongs to Sasha. Hopkins, that out of control power will become the most strange and cruel blade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib felt that he had been cut into hundreds. Even countless copies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the number of copies is not as much as he thought, and it is far from the countless copies. He just looks a bit like a deep-sea octopus that is entangled in the flesh, flesh-colored, with light coming out from it - the sky, the surrounding buildings, the ground is dark, translucent muscles can be hidden To the source of light. The hyperactive parts of human beings are squeezed into different places, one eye on the neck of the former "body" and the other on the end of one arm (tens of arms or legs), they are looking for Not the nose of him (or it?), and his mouth, something that should not be called a mouth. Still in the old position (probably), only the teeth, and the skin wrapped around the alveolar bone and upper and lower jaw bones. The chin, cheeks, neck and tongue are missing, and the innumerable tentacles stick out from the various protrusions and recesses, swaying swayingly, covered with transparent rain and mucus - people hear strange twists and broken sounds The road surface sways up and down like a seismograph. The slate with the thickness of the palm is torn open piece by piece, and everything touched by the tentacles. Whether it's a street lamp, a plant or a bronze sculpture, or a fire hydrant and a trash can fixed on the sidewalk, it will be crushed, pinched, and swallowed. It is not known whether it is really swallowing the so-called gastrointestinal tract. However, it is an indisputable fact that those who are squirming and can expand to cover the half of the street after the "things" cover everything that disappears without a trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It" did not escape, nor attacked. In fact, he was in chaos, too much power disturbed Besib’s brain, he even I can't concentrate on one thing, he is violent, uneasy and hungry like never before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bullet was embedded in the body of Besib, his movements suddenly stopped, and then the screams rang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tentacle rushes out of the drain, and the python rolls up and tightens the enemy's body. Its power is hundreds of times beyond that cold-blooded creature. The person was almost doubled on the spot, and the dirty and stinky blood was dripping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come to me, quietly." Hayman raised a hand, his face bare under the shimmer and rain, crystallized like It was carved out of marble, and the eyes were firm and not shaken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priests immediately followed this order, and they moved quietly, as if they were surrounded by fire in the winter wilderness, many of them People are shaking slightly, their fingers are stuck in the trigger, like they are bound by fear - among them, there are a lot of people and the guys responsible for blocking the "Ghoul" in the hospital. They have the same problem - they have killed dogs and killed people, but they are still true. For the first time, they are close to each other, facing this kind of thing... evil abhorry can not accommodate things in the category of reason and imagination. “What is this?” asked a young priest, full of disgust, a little fear, a small amount of curiosity, which was unruly and ridiculous in peacetime, but no one would care about it now, Hayman did. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tentacles and the pile of "things" did not chase, it looked even a little dazed, John Elder continued to stand in the rain, next to the person responsible for protecting him, fresh blood rushed down from the wrist, constantly dripping In the rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Devil." Hayman said shortly: "We are not fighting with blood," he pointed to a dark corner, hidden inside. The man immediately came out, and she lowered her head and walked down to Hayman's knees, and Hayman reached out and touched her forehead. "It's fighting against the demon who is in power, in power, in the dark world, and in the sky." He paused, and the next thing was to say to the person who was in front of him: "Put on The helmet of salvation, the sword of the Holy Spirit, is the Word of God. The Word of God is lively and effective, faster than all two-edged swords, even soul and spirit, bones and bone marrow, can penetrate The cuts and the thoughts and ideas in the heart can be discerned."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blessed nun raised her head, she has an ugly face, cheekbones Blowing up, lips groaning, a huge nose hanging forward, can just kiss a pointed chin, the yellow hair is soaked by the rain: "May the sinner be wiped out of the world. May the wicked be gone. My Heart, praise the Lord." She responded with a soft voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she walked to the terrible and detestable "devil" that appeared in the end of the world, all the men let her go. It can even be said to be with a respect, which is almost rare in Baiyancheng. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elder John was sent aside, someone stopped bleeding for him, he frowned slightly, and if he wanted to, he was willing to shed more blood, but He is even more reluctant to violate Heyman’s wishes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The child..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is the Lord's servant, the Lord's sword "It’s arrogant, and the penalty is evil." Heyman said calmly, "This is also the will of the Lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pile of "things" are from them Not so far, the ugly nun went to its "scope" in just a few tens of seconds, malicious waves came from under the feet, she almost fell, but before that, she had reached out and metal The light shone on her barely dry, thin, dry hands, and the light became longer and wider in the blink of an eye, becoming the shape of a one-handed sword. She took it and slashed it to Besib. . That sorrow may be the illusion of people, or it may be true. The only thing that is worthy of recognition is that the bullets can't be cut off by the evil and abominations that are affected. The huge wounds are like the lips in the shouting. It’s not known whether the body is blooming, but it’s not fatal, but “it” is really irritated, and the body that emits fluorescence is as violent as the mud with self-consciousness. All swallowed. The monks of Baiyancheng clenched the guns and other weapons, but they never heard Heyman’s orders. The people who had been strangled had already been eaten. Now the group of “things” once again gave a baby-like snoring . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
