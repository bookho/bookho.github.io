			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third class of the third grade has the names "Hempote" and "Streif" - indicating that the children in this classroom will be The teacher has a common education supervision. To be cautious, although the St. Thomas Church Primary School accepted the job application of the new community member, it will not hand over fifteen or twenty children to his hands. In any case, there is an experience around him. Old-fashioned, old teachers who are familiar with the situation are also very good for newcomers - if necessary, brake him, or gently push it at a certain time, between the current children... Oh, that’s all There are little demons who are fearless, and some new teachers will even be bullied to cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The children entered the classroom before the first class, not very quiet, but not as noisy as the average person imagined, chaotic, each The children have their own orange-yellow tables and chairs, their bags are placed next to the seats, Dolores is carrying his bag and slamming, connecting the things that have knocked down several people: "Sorry!" the little girl shouted, while Continue to create things. Before that, another child from the Kent family sneaked to the other side of the classroom early – just like the second row of seats on the school bus. It was also her exclusive location, although it was a bit far from the teacher and the blackboard...but Exempting the tragedy (or farce) that is unfortunate in some activities and Dolores is in a group, and the water dispenser is in two steps. When she wants to drink water, she does not need to leave the position, as long as she owes a body. Stretch your hand and you will do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annies overlaps her arms at the desk and places her chin in the middle of her arms. The child’s body is full of energy, but Dolores brings The mental torture is more unbearable than housework and homework. She always feels tired. Maybe before the teacher walks into the classroom, she can still lie on the table and close her eyes for a while - but she immediately sees a gold. Brown lamb, Sasha Streif. Did he come to his father, Mr. Streif? It may or may be lost. The classrooms of the St. Thomas Church Elementary School are the same as other elementary schools. In addition to the name of the teacher hanging in the doorway, the markers are hoisted, except that other schools use a variety of animals, and St. Thomas’s identity is used to highlight the identity of the church’s primary school. Religious figures are hanging at the door, because every family living here will go to church to pray on time. Most children can recognize Jesus’ disciples and other saints without difficulty, but every year there will be such a thing. One or two exceptions... The little boy sat down in an empty seat, he took a book out of his bag, and a notebook and so on at the desk. Anne discovered that her previous inference was Wrong, because the book that the child took out was exactly what their teacher, Mr. Humbert asked them to read. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little girl with brown hair rubbed her eyes tiredly, she had already anticipated the following things, but Mr. Humbert gestured to Sasha, not Dolo Reis, not when she came to read this shorthand, Anne still involuntarily squirmed her body, just like an invisible bug crawling on her skin, but even so, her performance is better than Dolores is good. Dolores laughed when Mr. Humbert’s eyes swept over Anne and didn’t stop. Not only did he laugh, but she pushed the lower chair back with her buttocks. Push, she must have thought that Mr. Humbert would choose her to read aloud - but it is clear that Mr. Humbert has a new darling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henbot’s new darling is very good, with clear pronunciation, correct sentence, and ups and downs. The only drawback is that the expression of emotion is not so clear. - But this seems to be more suitable for reading the reading materials here, like the priests who are standing on the reading platform and retelling these sacred chronicles for the believers. He does not need to yell, wave his arms, or make all kinds of exaggerations. Expression, because the profound meaning in the text has already surpassed the extra value that human beings can give - it only needs to be fully and clearly stated. Of course, this reason the children don't understand, so they usually read as they understand. For example, when a saint is insulted and killed, the voice is raised very high or low, and the teacher rarely interrupts and guides them... After all, children around the age of nine or ten can read and It’s great to know the meaning of it in a rough way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This child is beautiful, and his voice is very soft and stable - unlike ordinary children, the vocal cords will suddenly tighten when certain syllables are made - the sound becomes unprecedentedly sharp and sorghum, which is not so flattering. Anne noticed that Dolores was still shaking the chair impatiently at the beginning, but now it has stopped. She is staring at Sasha, and she is envious and unwilling. But what about her? A year ago, Dolores really got the favor of the teachers of Humbert and even the whole school. But after Anne appeared, the most favored children of the former changed people, learned excellent, strong hands-on ability, rich imagination, and refined appearance. And who can't put more snacks on children with gentle temperament? What's more...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reading is finished, and Hunter is praising Sasha Streif, yes, Sasha’s father, Mr. Streif will Teaching at this is also one of the reasons. Every teacher is inevitably more tolerant and valued to the children of his peers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dolores turned his head and made a face to Annie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A ridiculous face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lunch time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;St. Thomas Church Primary School lunch is divided into two types, one is brought back by the children themselves, the other is provided by the school, two per day USD, you can choose your own drinks, staples, desserts and fruits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hop Hopkins is a good father. Although the lunch provided by St. Thomas Church Elementary School is quite delicious and nutritious, it is obviously not possible to reach a special and wide range of recipes. At the request of Mr. Streif, he prepared three meals for Sasha and himself. The lunch brought to school was vegetable juice, rye bread, cheese, sliced ​​fat foie gras, shortbread beef and sour cream vegetable salad. . The sour cream vegetable salad is made now - Dr. Hopkins stirs small tomatoes, cucumbers, purple cabbage, onion rings and sweet corn with a small silver fork to make them full of sour cream with bubbles Mixed together: "How about the morning class?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha reveals a kind of smile that is so wonderful but difficult to generalize - he used to I see and be familiar with all kinds of "people" in the book and Hopkins' memory, but those can't be compared with the living ones, especially when they are so close to you - although only one morning He feels that he has received more messages than in the past year: "Maybe it should be fun," the child carefully selected the vocabulary: "But I think I was defamed, although it has not yet been rejected or hateful. Stage. (Hopkins provoked an eyebrow on one side), but I think that if Mr. Humbert continues to insist on his concern, it will take only a week or two to reach that level."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&& Mr. Hopkins used a small fork to separate a small tomato: "All?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Almost all." Sasha recalls that there are several strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Feeling?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha sighed and held his chin, Amazon Of course, there will be no kindergartens and primary schools in the jungle. When he is in the town, he is not likely to be close to the school. The feeling of being embarrassed by a group of children is quite fresh, but such bad feelings are too slight compared with the maliciousness he encountered before. It’s a little bit like a furry little beast with no teeth growing around. He knows it shouldn’t, but still feels very cute. “I understand,” he knows his father is reminding him, small Children are also human beings. “Children often make things that are unexpected to adults.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Hopkins rolled his lips to hide his smile. He tore the bread, added the foie gras and cheese, and made a small piece of fat foie gras sandwich: "Yes."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha slightly raised his eyes, but he quickly understood his father’s words, because the direction suggested by Hopkins’ doctor was that the skin was dark and not enough. The perfect but vibrant little girl, Dolores Kent is rushing straight into her lunch box, her focus is almost entirely on Sasha, as if Sasha is covered with syrup and fruit. , nutty ice cream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think the child doesn't like you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She hates me."< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father and son’s opinions are consistent, but Dolores’s next act seems to be countering for their words – she invites Sasha to share her lunch... ... Of course, she will also share the lunch of Sasha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A seemingly intimate and awkward act, but the black eyes sparkled with a small spark from beginning to end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be honest, Dolores’ lunch is not as refined as Mr. Streif’s, but it has surpassed most lazy careless housewives. Filled in your child's lunch box, there are only two or three kinds of sandwiches of inferior sandwiches and hot dog bread - Sasha saw oily, bright red sausages, topped with black pepper, covered underneath A thick layer of spiced tomato juice is used to widen macaroni, almond bread and French fries. The color is bright and the aroma is tangy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha suspected that she had spit in her lunch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither Big Hopkins nor Little Hopkins accepts this obviously unscrupulous suggestion, but has not waited for the first one they rejected When the words were spoken, Anne Kent solved the problem for them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Eat yours." Anne Kent was almost followed by Dolores. "This is what mom did." She added. "Because you are playing this game, so from now on, she is responsible for lunch and dinner, unless I encounter the situation yesterday... Dolores, for God or the devil, you will sit in peace. Let's eat it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dolores closed his mouth, and the suspected sight swept between his lunch box and Annie's lunch box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you have questions, you can call your mother directly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dolores While holding the lunch box and walking away, Anne Kent wrinkled her face into a ball: "Sorry," she said. "I am really sorry, but don't care about Dolores, she and every new child will come. With such a set, she just didn't want to eat the lunch I made.” She bit her lip with her teeth and launched a complaint from the child: “She always can't go with me. If she can make me not happy, she can do anything. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't matter," Dr. Hopkins said with tolerance: "Although I can see that your mother's craftsmanship is very good. But unfortunately, Sasha did not." Ways to exchange lunch with other people... He is allergic to many things.” He pushed the sour cream salad to Sasha: “You used to make lunch... um? Maybe dinner?”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mom is pregnant," Annie replied succinctly: "The stomach is too big to walk, Dad is Working outside, I shared the housework with Dolores, she weeded, watered the garden, cleaned the leaves, etc. I was responsible for cleaning the room, washing clothes and cooking. Our age allowed us to do these things..." She was in time The land added: "Not to mention that we can receive double pocket money for housework."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
