			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xi’s squatting on the pillars, her sweat and tears have washed the makeup on her face into a mottled look, the pillars are still spinning The audience was vague, some places were on fire, the area lit by the fire was chaotic, and there were shadows of arching and shaking everywhere. Several people on the VIP table near the stage leaned down into their seats. Hearing, Xixi didn't want to think about whether they were already dead—she continued to sing, didn't stop, she couldn't hear her own voice, but she already knew what the consequences would be. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why are they still not coming? Xi Xi shouted in his heart, they said that as long as she showed her ability at this concert, they would come to meet her, she believed them, they are the same as her, have special ability, they originally Should be above the ordinary people, like angels and even gods, no one can control them, bully them, hurt them, she is eager to be one of them - God responded to her prayers, she has With new abilities, strong, special, and secret new abilities, she will be their pride - she has already complied with the agreement, but what about them? Why are they still not coming? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is her ability not strong enough? Not enough to make them tempted? It doesn't matter, she can be stronger and stronger, she can let all the people present die! As long as she is willing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A man has walked down from the audience. He does not seem to be affected. Is he a member of the "greeter"? Xi's heart leaped wildly, and she smiled and extended her arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man looked at her and made a warning gesture. He crossed the VIP seat and reached into the water. The boiling water suddenly calmed down. This area spreads rapidly around him, and a narrow pontoon extends out of the water. The brown-haired man walked down the pontoon to the stage. A woman walked out from the side and followed him. Her face moved from darkness to light little by little, and Xixi saw her face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is Catherine, and the face of Xiqiao suddenly becomes bloodless. She closed her mouth in fear and collapsed. She knows, this man and Catherine is a group. They happen to be members of an organization that opposes "they", "they" and Xi Xi said that the name of the organization is called "institution." “Institution” is a conservative and cruel place. It supports a group of abilities who are willing to be supported, and regards those who desire freedom, hope for the future, and want to restore their proper status and power as criminals and thugs. Pursue "they" mercilessly. Every time they are grouped up and attacked, just like the lions follow the lions, they never let go of a drop of blood, a trace of fur, a bone or a piece of skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's wise." Abel said: "Otherwise I will knock her down like a bird."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine looks pale. She was annoyed to find that her sympathy was once again in the wrong direction. No matter how miserable your encounter is - Catherine murmured, it is not a reason, you have no right to hurt others. These innocent people, they like you, love you, but they should not die for you, there are 50,000 people here. Xiqiao, 50,000 people. She used her ability to suppress Xiqiao. Let her never open her mouth again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Going again," Xixi trembled, a man, just behind her, the voice was steady and magnetic, "Go again, use your strongest Ability, let us see." He paused: "See the two people below? Don't hesitate, they can't hurt you - in fact, on the contrary, you can kill them, like killing two Only a small bug - don't worry, I am by your side."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A pair of hands suddenly placed on the waist of Xiqiao, she trembled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Open mouth," the voice persuaded: "Sing, my bird."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Abel and Catherine have already reached the edge of the stage. Abel has been paying attention to Xiqiao. When she opened her mouth for the second time, he pulled out the gun without hesitation and fired several shots at her. Quasi-head and heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bullet screamed and rushed to the west, and the west was full of bright red eyes. She could almost see how the bullet was spinning and stabbing her forehead. - A pair of invisible hands stretched out from behind her, like a juggling act. Once on, the bullets disappeared, as if they had never existed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She smiled happily and let go of her throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abel and Catherine’s heart slammed into a shock, their internal organs violently cramped, Abel’s fingers could not hold the gun, and the gun fell into In the water, he covered his mouth with his hand, blood flowed out of his nose and ears, Catherine's vision was blurred, her eyeballs trembled, unable to grasp the focus, she tried twice to seize Abel. The coat, she fumbled, and took Abel back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn..." Abel said vaguely: "Take me...to the water, Catherine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
