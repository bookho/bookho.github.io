			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seventh district of New York City was almost occupied by the Chinese. From the 18th century onwards, they built their own kingdoms there, they have their own Law, religion, writing, language, common sense and ethics have not touched the outside world for a long time, nor allowed anything from the outside world to enter this nearly semi-closed world. This situation continued into the twentieth century, and the sixth or even fifth generation of the Chinese understood that they could no longer continue this way, and they began to tentatively extend their tentacles beyond the seventh district and beyond New York City. It’s not that hard. Their ancestors have accumulated considerable wealth over the past few hundred years. They and their younger generations are smart and hardworking. Their mysterious culture is curious and admired – soon, New York. The city has the first Chinese member. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member is said to have been nearly half a year old when he was elected, but this does not prevent him from acting positively - he proposed and urged the city to agree to the transformation of the seventh district - convenient Pedestrian streets, new, clean and bright market spaces, outdoor dining areas and better walks and single-lane connections, in return, the seventh district will change the past indifference, conservative attitude, to New York City or more The scope is open in steps, more Chinese will walk out of the seventh district, and the seventh district will allow more “outsiders” to enter and work and live here. The city’s various proposals and ideas will also be seventh. District residents have the greatest possible support and corresponding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mid-September to the end of the street is one of the most striking measures, one month of newspaper and TV publicity, 300 outdoor shops, Four temporary stages, 200,000 people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Food, silk, handicrafts and even gold, which are difficult to count in quantity and quantity, are generously placed under the sky by their sellers, on the ground, The people they attract are immersed in it, and it is difficult to extricate themselves. Many of them are close to this unique and embarrassing market for the first time. Most of the goods are placed directly on the stalls and can be tasted directly. Touching, trying on or trying on, more and more people are stranded in front of the stalls of interest, so that the originally wide and flat pedestrian street becomes crowded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha.Street is on the verge of a sun-dried horsefish, which is covered with the same kind of other kinds of stalls. Hundreds of gray ash and yellow ochre, the inwardly concave eyeballs are closely staring at the human beings coming in and out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Claude Streif tasted a piece of fish that the stall owner called "Meixiang" and found it to be very soft, salty and fragrant. I don’t understand how it relates to the kind of flower that blooms in winter and its fragrance... He nodded and bought about a fifth of a pound of fish cut into pieces, and he gave it to the ride. Sasha on his shoulder, Sasha curiously took it and smelled it. The strong sea salt smell made him sneeze violently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people around them laughed. The owner of the salted fish stall didn't know where to take out a bamboo stick. The bamboo stick was wearing a twisted fish. He handed it to Treff and pointed it to his shoulder. Little Streiff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steffef took it and sniffed and found that it was a fried, very crispy yellow croaker. He handed it over to Sasha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you," Sasha said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Welcome again." The boss said, this is what Streifs guessed, because the old-fashioned voice of the dark complexion is too heavy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Streifs walked out of the stalls, the crowd was as close as the salted fish hanging and placed in the stalls - in New York City this is very It’s rare that Streif firmly held Sasha’s calf to prevent him from being knocked over by the people who passed by – they only stopped in front of a special stall, even if they had not finished One-third of the street, Little Strath's hands and backpacks have been filled with this trophy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We should probably find a place to have dinner." Treff, who failed to get a snack, said with regret that they were diverted from the crowd and went into another A quieter street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He found out that his judgment may have been wrong in a few minutes, the whole street is full of aroma - but not oil, meat or star anise, cinnamon These edible spices are exuded to seduce the scent of the human stomach, but are more adept at deepening the human body and the inner fragrance... sweet sandalwood and precious agarwood, Streif is all around the Chinese, they The look looks happy but solemn – but from time to time someone has cast a sigh of surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They walked to the end of the street with the flow of people, greeted them with a huge, golden temple, which was illuminated by thousands of lights, The ceiling on the gate is covered with translucent glazed tiles, the plaque on the bottom of the black gold, the walls of the ochre, the dark brown door with the brass round nails, and the threshold of about one foot below. Before people go in, they will buy a bunch of incense sticks on a small stall covered in apricot cloth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Streif noticed that there was more than one warning sign on the periphery of the temple, which read "Don't Visit" in English. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A temple that only allows believers to enter. Mr. Streif thought that he was not prepared to disturb these devout people. If he did not see a familiar face, and this face, especially the face that appeared here at the moment, aroused his interest, maybe he would immediately go away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw his new colleague Kemira. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is standing among a group of Chinese people. To be exact, between a group of Chinese women, men stand in a little distance from them, but Streley The husband is convinced that their attention has always been part of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every woman, including Kemira, is dressed very luxuriously, wearing silk or velvet cheongsam, carrying a thin shawl, carrying around her neck A gold necklace with pearls and emeralds, the hair is meticulously rolled up, and fixed with a bun or a comb that matches the necklace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a pile of black hair, Kemira’s light hair is particularly eye-catching, with her green eyes and white skin, she Not cramped, but a little uneasy, her hands are fragrant, the incense burns fiercely, the white smoke is around – if it’s not a reminder of a Chinese woman, she might let the incense stick to her own Fingers - she grips the incense stick with the middle finger and index finger of both hands, the thumb is against the head of the incense, lifting up until it exceeds the eyebrows... Her movements are both elegant and accurate, at least Strath looks like this (Although he doesn't know how to worship the Chinese gods, he can compare her with the people next to him), and his sharp eyes catch a thing - the dark red rope is hanging down An emerald statue, the image of the Chinese. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chinese people’s way of worship is quiet, but cumbersome, everyone has to worship at least four times, once in each direction, when Camilla is at the last pilgrimage When she saw Streif, she showed a surprised expression. The Chinese women around her noticed it and looked at her sight. Then the Chinese men, Kemila’s incense was hurriedly inserted into the burning In the four-legged copper furnace, after talking to them a few words, these people came to Streif. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello, Mr. Streif, and...Sasha." Kemira smiled reluctantly, she didn't seem to want to Here, see Steve: "This is the teacher of the St. Thomas Church Primary School, my colleague, Claude Streif... This is my... Father, Mr. Kai Shengguo."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kaishengguo, the first Chinese-American member of New York City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very tall, with double white spots, clear and loud voice, without accents. His attention to Streiff is more than what an ordinary person can achieve, perhaps because of his concern for his daughter, and he invites the Stellaf father and son to have dinner with them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Great." Stellaf thought, of course, not only because their dinner finally came to a close - one of his doubts got Answer, from the first meeting, he noticed the biggest violation of Kemira, she has internal pleats - a special skin fold in the corner of the eye, covering the tears more or less Also known as Mongolian pleats. Many Chinese have this feature, but people from other countries are rare. Streif once speculated that Kemira had a quarter or a third of North Asian blood, but did not expect Kaimir to inherit Much, her external features are almost entirely in the Baltic people, and now it seems that only one-half is at most, because Mr. Kaishengguo is a pure Chinese. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And her last name, Streif once thought she was an Icelander, so there is no surname, now he finally understands, Kemira played a little The trick, she cleverly hides her surname in the name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dinner venue is arranged in a small, quiet and small garden, a two-story building with a dark exterior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After entering the door, Streiff and his son saw a glass cover illuminated by a projection lamp with a large triangular wing - Bishasha Still higher, the ivory yellow ochre, the edges are silky, almost translucent under the light, and the red and gold ribbons are tied in the middle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another glass cover, it is a cleaner and smaller thing, milky white, it looks like a piece of silk woven petals. Or a small monster used by the boat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fish and bird's nest." Sasha said in his father's ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice is very light, but there is no intention to conceal the meaning, a young Chinese who walked beside them heard it. He turned his head and smiled very heartily: "Yes," he said. "It's the fins and the bird's nest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
