			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moon hangs high over the sea, the sea breeze slowly blows away the dust and heat from the charcoal charcoal in the barbecue, the chef is busy, a pair of fat The hand dexterously flipped the skewers with a considerable variety. In the corner of the terrace, there was a barrel-shaped stainless steel pot for cooking. The heat was boiling and the white mist was blowing. The chef's assistant poured into the sea salt and vanilla. powder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory and Chennike put together a lazy gesture, like a piece of melted butter, similar to a soft place on a large On the round recliner, the recliner is woven from the thick brown rattan of the straight cut macaroni. It is shaped like a sloping bird's nest. Each of them has a golden tart sweet and sour wine in their hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know where I found Xiqiao?" Gregory said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where?" Chennike responded carelessly as he leaned over the cup, his nose into the cool glass wall, and the inhalation echoed in the cup— - He still has such a little curiosity. Gregory is always so intimate about the origins of Xiqiao. The most capable reporters who are thoroughly pursued, brazen and unscrupulous can only trace the history of Xiqiao to the first 13 years. That year, Xiqiao was still a fifteen-year-old girl. She was led by Gregory for the first time in a public place - a recording studio. The sound engineer of that day also clearly remembered the girl, her white skin. , hair and red eyes, and the treble and heavy that seem to be able to fly to the sky forever, can always go down to the bass in hell, she stands behind the glass, with headphones, the voice is born in her chest, Growing, tightening in her throat, and then coming out through the mouth - like a flower rushing out of the thick soil. The sound engineer left the tape of the day, which proved to be a wise move. Three years later he sold the tape for 100,000 yuan. A TV station bought it. The sound inside it broke and sometimes stretched. Almost all of them were "ah, ah, ah..." and there was a lot of encouragement and pleading encouragement from Gregory. Minutes, no one spoke, they just played the tape, the picture solidified, and the audience was as fascinated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Great Victoria Lake District."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah," said Neek. The Great Lake Victoria region is a strange place. It is in the southern hinterland, and the aborigines on that continent are black. Some of them will have albino patients. These people are considered to be possessed by white ghosts. They will be expelled or killed. No one knows when the first albino patient was, because what came to the big The growing number of albino patients in the Lake Victoria region, but where they settled, is an indisputable fact. They care for each other, get married, and give birth to children as pale as they are. The Great Lake Victoria region is one of the most densely populated areas in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A dirty, damp, stinky grass shed." Gregory said: "I swear that I just wanted to go with the friends to do some wild ducks. Where are I standing? Waiting for the hounds to start the fat little guys, the water vapor at dawn is very heavy. There are fogs floating around, and the surrounding water is quiet, the water under the feet penetrates into the bottom of the boots, I think It was very cold, but I couldn't move it. At that time, I heard her voice - a screaming scream. Loud and crisp, it penetrated the sky and the earth, like a sharp cockroach... I am from I have never heard such a voice since then, such despair, such anger, such sorrow... I know what I am going to do, let the wild ducks go to hell, I take my gun and my feet The loach ran over half a reed, I arrived very promptly, her grandfather and sister had been killed, she was still alive, and a hunter working for the wizard was busy cutting her feet."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lifts up Cup, took a sip: "I killed the guy, his companion gave me a shot, but I escaped, he immediately fled - leaving the bloody girl and two white bodies. "He is out of God: "Can you imagine the sight of the time? The sun jumped out, the golden light was scattered on her body, and the whole body was covered with tiny scars - it was a mouse, a mosquito, and could not be treated in time." The dermatitis left, she screamed and curled up in the sun, raised her arms to cover her eyes, like a little vampire who was frankly on Christ Square - bright red blood stayed from her ankles, that mouth The child is so bright, like the cinnabar deliberately smeared."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She doesn't look like a southern inland person." Said: "The five senses and the skull are not very similar."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is not all," Gregory said: "I did a little investigation later, she It’s a mixed-race, her father is a black man, very rich, and very powerful. The mother is a Westerner. A blond-skinned beauty, she was born to be inherited from her mother's appearance, but two years later, her eyes turned from light brown to red," Gregory shrugged his shoulders. The hair and eyebrows also began to turn white. She was diagnosed as an albino patient. Her father took her out of the hospital, did not go home, and handed her directly to a faithful subordinate, who threw her to the Great Lake Victoria area. - Her grandfather, also an old white ghost, adopted her and several other girls who are helpless. The 'hunter' attacked them for the first time, and her sisters were in a morning or evening. Suddenly disappeared without a trace, her youngest sister died because of dysentery. Her grandfather was afraid that someone would dig her out of the grave, chop it up and sell it to the wizard, so that the little girl’s soul would never rest in peace. She was buried under her own bed—the grass shed was their newest home. It was less than half a month after they moved. They didn’t even dare to make fires, they didn’t touch people, they just made things from the lake and the lake. Eat, like water Algae, fish, shrimp, snails and bird eggs... I helped her find a Catholic cemetery - it was very strict, buried her grandfather and sister, and then brought her here, when she first arrived here. - God, thin is like a cockroach, and riddled with holes, Nenec, you never think of how I fixed her up a little bit. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It’s amazing,” said Neekke, shaking her head. “She never seems to have suffered a bit, and she is always on the top.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because you have never seen her original look, a cute and poor little mink cat, she yelled when she first used the shower, she thought the coffee machine was magical, for a long time In, she thinks that I am a powerful wizard.” Gregory smirked smugly: “Yes, I am a wizard, I created her, not the original inexplicable 'can’, but Xiqiao - My banshee, the man's banshee! The woman's banshee! The child's banshee! The old woman's banshee! Everyone's banshee!" He drank the wine in the cup: "Have her health!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wish health." Chennike said that he also drank the wine in the cup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory is still unfinished, he seems to want to say something, but the chef came over, he grabbed a lobster in one hand: "That?" Asked: "Mr. Corso?" Gregory closed his mouth. His eyes turned around between the two lobsters. It was difficult to decide: "...and so on," he said. "Okay, Both must be. Bake the lamb chops and the beef tongue."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chef keenly licked a shallow cockroach and lifted the lobster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you think boys will need a nightingale?" Gregory said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, I said." Chennike pouted his lips: "They just want credits." He thought about it with his head: "I It’s not very deep contact with them, but... I have seen Hopkins’ father, Gregory, he is a doctor, a child who loves his children, a gentle and gentle but not harsh father, he will In many ways, the reason for the big line is that you can't step on the bottom line he set up. I am a teacher. I know that this kind of person is the hardest to deal with because he is smarter than you and knows his children better than you. He Knowing how to use the feelings between them, he knows how to play with them - he may be able to endure a c, but he will never be happy to see Hopkins's surname appear in the credits at the end of the poster and film. He dangled the empty cup: "I have to admit, Gregory, you are very good, very...successful. But in a lot... well, I mean some actors who are more stubborn and stubborn, actors and singers still I can't grow a career on the countertop." He sighed: "There are Thousands of people are waiting for you to pick it up, give up Sasha Hopkins, and don't do it, they won't do it. To be honest, that is, two beautiful children, I don't believe you will find it. The second one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
