Lila said: "I am also a student of Grande."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They met in the cubicle on the first floor of the library, Hopkins took the book, and Lila took the book. Sasha noticed that Lila was carrying almost all textbooks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My previous foundation was too bad," Lila said calmly and calmly. "Uncle wants me to repeat, but I tried to read a few books." I feel that I can catch up with the progress of my peers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your enrollment score is 4.0, and you are now reading the 7th grade book." Sand put down his book and sat down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is no way," Lila said. "We are all very smart, but Lila is reading."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha stares at him without a smile, his face is beautiful, but when he wants to be fearful, he can do as good as his father, but this Lila is Not shrinking for this, her hands pressed on the table, her eyes soft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How long have you been there?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Forty-one days."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chill is like a slender squat crawling along the heel of Sasha. Today is the first Friday in February, starting from the second day of Christmas. Count, forty-one days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he and Besib watched boxing at Lafayette, Dr. Anthony Hopkins saw his first patient in the past decade . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How many?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At first twenty-seven, now four Lila said (although Sasha is no longer sure if she is still Lila): "One of them is male, we call him Billy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" What?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Lulu. Marianne. And me.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about Lila?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She needs a break," said Lila. "A quiet, long break."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Does she still exist?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"You are lying," Sasha said tiredly. "You said that you are 'Lilla.' There can be no two 'Lilla', you killed her, you inherited her name." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl was silent for a long time, then she showed a dignified smile to Sasha: "It is very dangerous to touch the main core personality, to her or to us. Believe that we don't want to do that." She explained: "She is very resistant. Really, we didn't expect her reaction to be so big - we divided what she hated, disliked and feared most - - Lulu bears the part of the parent who was killed, Billy bears the part that is imprisoned and beaten, and Marianne bears the part that is forced/rape. And I bear the part of the 'devil'... ..." Here, the smile on her face became a bit helpless: "Look, Lila can't even accept that she is a power, she is too weak, too sensitive, she refuses to admit us, is not willing to join us. Communication, things messed up, I almost couldn’t control Billy and Lulu. Finally I had to ask the doctor to help us-""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He created you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He awakened us," Lila corrected. "You should know. All subsequent personalities existed from the very beginning, no one can create." A soul comes, except God, the only thing that can make us born is Lila, Mr. Hopkins just let us..." She paused. It’s looking for an adjective: “Separate.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the son of a doctor, Sasha certainly understands what this is all about – being abused at an early age And the people who are ignored often produce so-called successor personalities—this personality is created because children cannot resist the suffering they have suffered and are forced to suppress their emotions. For a long time, they will fantasize. Imagining game partners, filling their anger and dissatisfaction into this trusted "companion", let this "partner" do things they can't do. For example, rebellion and venting too much negative emotions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many parents have encountered this situation: their children suddenly screamed loudly, knocked over the dishes, pulled the cat’s tail and dropped it on the ground. But after a few minutes, he will firmly believe that these things are done by another small partner. Nothing to do with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can even call out the name of another small partner and describe his image. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why most people grow up will be normal because they accept the reality, they no longer fantasize, the owner will refuse to recognize the successor personality (Also known as the second personality. Third personality). But as long as the incentives still exist, or become more severe, the successor personality will continue to live in peace, they are only locked up by the thick wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of things can be an opportunity to break this wall, being abandoned, beaten, car accidents, strong/rape... and... hypnosis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lilla" opened his fingers, as if he was patting the lamb, gently patted the book in front of him: "I am very happy that you are willing to be sorry for her." She said: "But I want you to know that we didn't kill her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So where is she?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said, she is resting," Lila said, her eyes flashing: "We took everything that would make her sad, she fell asleep." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"An idiot," Sasha commented sarcastically. Lila shook her head, "a baby." She said, "Sasha, no matter what you think, please don't forget, I am Lila, I am." She, we are all her, no one can understand her than us, please believe me, she is very happy now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha stood up, the chair made a sharp The haul of the book, a book was hit by him on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several students have looked at the place where the sound is coming out, "What?" Someone asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's okay," Lila's smile became tolerant: "We're just talking about the problem," she replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The discussion is over." Sasha said, he took the book and turned away, forgetting the book still under the table, Lila helped him pick it up. There was a round white cloud on the ground. She picked it up and looked at it before she realized that it was a lamb-made lamb bookmark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She clipped it back into the book, out of the library, and walked along the gentle Grand River. The river at dusk was dark gray and fuchsia, and several black little wild ducks swayed into the riverbank. Over there, it spread to the fragrant trumpet narcissus in the river bank. The flower of the fragrant trumpet narcissus was yellow and yellow, and it was pure white. Its green leaves were straight to the sky, just like the knight’s oath. Long sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you coming along the river?" Anthony Hopkins said, he was sitting barefoot like he was last night. Inside the rattan chair, "I smell the smell of fragrant narcissus, very rich, and the library - dust, lead, ink, camphor, waxing oil, preservatives, as well as human, historical and legal scent "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I also brought you a book back," Lila said. "Your son's book."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins immediately recognized the lamb bookmark, or did he give it to his little Hopkins? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you talked to him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Talked."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He likes you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't like it," Lila said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You want him to like you." The doctor said: "This is a very important thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," Lila said. "Doctor, I will let him like us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She kneels and kisses the pale foot with great respect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib looked at Sasha, he looks back when he returns Sad and angry, I have a lot of troubles. He thought that he could only sleep quietly tonight. I didn't expect Sasha to walk into his room after half an hour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you remember that box?" Sasha said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remember." Besib said, "Do we still need to lie together?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;"That would be better." Sasha said that he did not know whether the outside body would fall off the chair and cause panic in the inner thoughts, but everything was taken care of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishb only felt the light flashing, and he saw the ivory white dome again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was preparing to say something, and he heard Sasha say, "I thought of a way."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The highlight of Easter." Abby screamed and said, around his fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two actors have been dressed up, a blond little boy with furry white ears and a cover girl like "Bunny" magazine The short tail, no more than seven years old, his opponent is a person who is already quite familiar with the individual Sibu and Sasha, the short and fierce Tani boy "other." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the most important investors, Constantine, Judah, Besib and Sasha have their own VIP seats, which is the best position, almost I can see the faint fluff on the child's cheeks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They don’t know how Abby "trained" these children, and the goods that Croven sent originally looked like, at least Sasha saw, It is a gentle and a little dull child, with a dull gaze and a bit of pleasing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go to the center of the boxing ring - the boss’s command, today’s game must be played for five minutes, he can’t kill the opponent at once – he has to be fed up It is sin to die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "May Hanuman bless you," said the Nepalese boy, raising his fist and hiding his face behind him, whispering, "May Hanuman bless me." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Nepali boy punched the little face, Besib turned his head and said, "We can go ahead." Said Sha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will see the last one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am poisoned in clean water, taking the blood of the innocent, my hand will not be clean, I will be guilty, my sins will not be forgiven. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
