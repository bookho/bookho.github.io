			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Hopkins, maybe he will have more names before and in the future, but we still call him his current name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was aware that he was being tracked, at the platform 23 of Cape Town’s train station, two beautiful female violinists’ cheeks were close to their delicate red The violin plays the harp of the "skylark", and from the special entrance of the waiting room to the old-fashioned sliding door of the train, it is about two meters wide, and the soft and delicate scarlet carpet. The distinguished passengers have come one after another. Several train conductors dressed in the Lobos Express, the world's first luxury land train, snow white uniforms, shuttle gently and smile to the champagne and juice, please drink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s an old European gentleman’s head in front of the door, toast to the well-dressed guests and to deliver a simple and enthusiastic speech. Then pick up the hot stamping post and start reading the names of the passengers one by one in alphabetical order. After each name is read, there is a <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; handsome The waiter stepped forward to lead the passenger into the carriage, and the whole process was like the opening of a royal dance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Anthony Mr. Hopkins and Miss Sasha Hopkins are very honored to invite you to take Rover."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, we can now aim the lens at our protagonist, that is, it is elegant and modest - that kind of modesty that humans show for the good breed of piglets. The passenger who expressed gratitude to the guide waiter, although his smooth and smooth hair is more biased towards heron ash than gray many years ago - the former is obviously whiter, and the orientation and distance of the facial features are also Changed, but the deep blue eyes and the thick shadows of the eyebrows that hold the eyes tightly, the proud eagle hook nose, and the beautiful shape, reddish brown lips, the interesting elliptical scar on the edge of the left palm, it is a bit The traces left on the trunk after being cut off by the branches, although very shallow and mixed with other lines of the palm, and the slight neurotic tremors that often occur at the corners of the mouth, People can ignore the tiny place does not count, or you can make some off - such as us, a little make out his true identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl who has an unusual commemorative name, that is held tightly in her arms by Mr. Anthony Hopkins The four-and-five-year-old child wants to see her dark eyes like the purple lilac-like color after the rain. The pale gold is the distorted hair of the morning sun. You should know who she is. As for her mother, or her current situation, we will know later, so don't worry too much about it now, just follow Mr. Anthony Hopkins to watch this luxury monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only passengers that Lobos can accommodate are only 40 people, even if there is only one room for a single car. There is a strong aristocratic atmosphere everywhere in the train. The interiors of the carriages are all hardwood, with many windows and switches at any time. The room has plenty of daylight. The air-conditioning system and the spacious bathroom provide a 24-hour hot water bath - a shower in the Victorian bathtub and a view of Africa from the window. Standing in the meantime, I don't feel crowded. A standard kingsize bed or two equally luxurious single beds - this is pre-determined by the passengers and fixed at one end of the room. It is said that this is one of the 25 reasons why it was rated as the most luxurious train. The curtains of the bed and the pattern of the sofa were all designed by Mrs. Vos. The Edwardian flower pattern was chosen, noble and intimate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The food provided in the dining car is also biased towards English, simple, light and refined, in line with the subtle and elegant taste of modern aristocrats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also very Anthony's heart. He ordered fruit puree, red soup, grilled prawns, and English chowder for Sasha. He ordered chicken salad, mushroom soup, salmon steak, and yam beef for himself. The dessert is strawberry ice cream and chocolate pudding. Just as he lifted the glass and prepared to enjoy it, an elegant lady walked past him... her muscles suddenly became tiny, and ordinary people would not. He couldn't find the vibration, but it didn't escape the eyes and feelings of Anthony. He had a very deep understanding of the human body. Yes, he knew everything from the human body to the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony sniffed in the glass and grasped the fragrance of red wine, then swallowed a red wine, let the wine stay in the mouth for a while, hit two on the tongue Rolling, the senses fully experience the red wine, and finally all swallowed... In addition to the lady, there is also a gentleman who has always been guarding her, a young and handsome gentleman, who has a kind of It's hard to forget the taste, which makes Anthony think of a distant past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why do you guess what the first sentence she said to him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pressing the white napkin on the chest, Anthony lowered his voice: "My lovely little Sasha, I think, she will say, dear, we found him!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Dear, we found him!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really? Oh, my dear Mary, you really see it clearly. , really is that person!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man waiting in the room jumped up and held the elegant lady in her arms tightly At the same time, the door was closed tightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Absolute!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary pulled down the fiance's arm, "Don't be so excited "She is looking excited or shy: "Now, Martin, what do you say we should do? It is a report to the superior..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be stupid We reported nothing to the superior."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin interrupted her impatiently: "Well, let me think about it, now more than one person can Reward that person..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary shakes her head and says, "I don't think it's a good idea. Do you remember the fbi that died at the top of the Empire State Building? Hold your head with both hands, the internal organs are dragging outside... Or we get off at the next stop, then make a call... I remember they are very generous to those who provide reliable information."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." Martin took a few steps back and forth with his arm. "If he just got off the bus at that stop, the so-called reliable news It became a joke, and we have to keep an eye on him at any time. In this case, the danger is not so small, but the reward is only one percent." He shrugged: "Not as good as we do, Maria, We are not ordinary people, we can catch the madman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary failed to fall on the sofa, and unexpectedly discovered the excitement brought by the big prey. In the past, what controls her now is the fear corresponding to the former. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God bless, we carry what we need." Martin opened the suitcase that they carried with them, taking a long eighty from the dark side of the side. Centimeter's bow and six arrows: "Maria, with some high-efficiency anesthetics out, that person is worth more than death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Martin!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God, don't be stupid! Do you know how high the person's reward has been? 50 million dollars!" Martin lost Knocking down the bow, kneeling down and holding Mary's hand tightly, the palm of the hand is hot like a high-burning patient: "You know what it means, is it? Maria, answer me, is it?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But...he also carries a child."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have no intention of hurting this child, instead We are saving her!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Martin..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, Martin grabbed the cosmetic bag on the side and put it into Maria's hand, and looked at her with the charming blue eyes: "Please..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Mary picked up a sleek glass bottle, looked at the golden ochre liquid, took a certain amount with a straw, mixed it with another bottle of colorless liquid, and gave it to the long wait. Martin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please be careful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looks solemn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before working in an "institution" that was not "invited", Maria was a very dedicated biologist who did not need marijuana, morphine or other regulatory Narcotics, only borrow some plant extracts that are not commonly known, such as white flower mandala, comfrey aconite, snake grass and other anesthetic effects, can be turned over to a rhinoceros with a hundred micrograms. Anesthesia is not difficult for her. In fact, she can use the existing materials on her hands to create a venom that is no less than a python. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your help," Martin said, holding his excitement and kissing his fiancee's cheek gently. He is different from Maria. Before he entered the "institution", he was just a small man in Queens. He saw the excitement of being able to change big money, and the noble tone of the guy made him sick. To be honest, if the reward is allowed, he really wants to see how the person was tortured to death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to act tomorrow morning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Martin said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early hours of the morning, Anthony woke up, and the male voice at the beginning of Wagner’s opera reverberated in his skull. This is not the sound of a mechanical machine. It is from his memory, their voice is as clear as the first time they heard it, and they shouted in a low voice, saying, "Hallelujah!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; His lips trembled as the violin sounds steadily, his thin fingers dancing in the air, his eyes shining in the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bowstrings! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three pure steel hunting arrows vibrate in the sheets, but the depth of penetration alone knows that they did not hit the target. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin shrugged his shoulders, and he didn’t expect to succeed once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A small silver fork is inserted in a beautiful retaining wall On the board, fortunately Martin bent down in time, or his throat was his throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hell! The file doesn't say that this guy can also night vision."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room is dark, but in the eyes of Martin who can night vision, it is no different from daylight. Just no color. This was originally an advantage of her own, but now it was completely destroyed by the stupid intelligence officers in the "institution", and Martin was very depressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The music that only exists in Anthony’s mind continues, the male voice has reached the end, and then, it’s a female voice, a soft and pure female voice, symbolizing forgiveness and newborn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hides behind a dresser and carefully watches Martin's every move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a funny child, Anthony said in her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin walked toward the window when he came in, and the second fork flew past his eyeballs, almost at the same time, Martin’s bow again Move, six, no, nine branches and arrows in the three different directions to the past where the forks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go to hell!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marine cursed in pain in his heart, just attacked Although he deliberately did, he did not expect that the small fork would bring such a strong wind, although the eyeball was not injured, but the tears were stimulated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He moved his body quickly, and the arrow continually cut through the air and fell into the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where is this bitch hiding? The whole room is making me a hedgehog! Where is he?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;etc! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little girl and he should be in a room, why can't I hear her voice until now? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Martin looked puzzled at the other single bed, revealing a blond hair under the sheet, and suddenly he felt chilly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slight vibration woke up Mrs. Wilson in the No. 7 compartment, and she whispered dissatisfiedly: "This trip is really bad." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you also woken up? Oh, poor baby, can I give you a cup of hot milk?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said to the little girl who was sitting on another bed halfway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha nodded very politely, clear purple The blue eyes indicate that she has no drowsiness: "I want to read the book, will it hinder you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look, look, cute little angel, no need I care, I will pull the curtain up, don't you need me to read it for you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, thank you."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha watched the gentle lady pull up the thick curtain before opening the lamp on the side of the bed, picking up a book and turning to the place I read before continuing to look . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cover of the book reads, the author is the madman who declared that God is dead and the Puritans Nietzsche. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'The most calm words are the first sounds of arrogance; the thoughts that come to the end will affect the world.'"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the last moment of the explosion, Martin finally caught The edge of the window turned over, and the cold evening wind made him shudder, when he found a small fork on his left calf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Hello!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does that person, like himself, stay in the room for the last moment ? No, he should be a little later than himself and he was not injured before leaving the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then (the child will not be killed by his own bomb!)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; He is not maliciously speculative, but not far from Martin, a thin figure jumped up like an antelope, standing on the roof of the car, separated from Martin by a carriage.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin opened a sly smile.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This time really kills!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slowly raised his hands, two powerful military cymbals appeared in Anthony's field of vision, and the neat arrow arrows mounted on it flashed a terrible cold light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s already at the end of the high tide, the perfect male and female chorus makes Anthony even a little pick up, he smells the scent of the weed, this is Kaiser Lin's taste, and, this is the taste of Sasha...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Familiar bow sounds.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Hunting arrows in the air But it made a crisp sound, then jumped with the kind of collision, and fell outside the train.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin looked at the man’s hand in amazement The small bow, which was abandoned because of its short range, but in the hands of that person, their performance is unimaginable. Just now they shot the hunting arrows and smashed their own desired blow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony slowly and steadily came over to Martin, the breeze swayed his robes-like pajamas with gray hair, and the pair under long sleep pants On the feet, the pale skin is covered with blue veins. In the moonlight, his calm and solemn expression is reminiscent of a monk who has been suffering for many years.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin is busy installing弩 Arrow, but in the past, the one-handed installation took only 0.5 seconds to suddenly fail, and the hunting arrow slid out of the installation groove and fell into his arms.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At a distance of one meter from him, Anthony raised his bow and said: "Drop the weapon."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The music is over.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Martin! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the dull explosion sounded and many people didn't know what was going on, Maria rushed out of her room.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From her and Martin’s sixth carriage to the man’s second carriage, Maria stumbled all the way, holding several bottles in her hand, she Also wearing high heels at dusk, it is not as good for running as a soft carpet on the aisle of the carriage.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a man was approaching the smoky second car, a man reached out and stopped her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please don't go over, there has just been an explosion, it is very dangerous."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, I am going to see. I..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maria widened her eyes in horror, and she saw it through the gleam of smoke. The face of this person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But it is equally dangerous here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His right hand grasped a hunting arrow, drew a beautiful semi-circular arc in the air, easily inserted into the woman's fragile temple, the other The hand accurately caught the bottle that had fallen from the dying hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony sorted out his clothes and thought about whether he would go to Sasha first, and finally he decided to finish the transaction on his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to meet the special requirements of those rich passengers who are similar to paranoia, Lobos towed the luggage compartment is very large, at the end of the luggage compartment, there is a A huge container that occupies nearly half of the car. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony pulled a handle outside the container, and the thin strip-shaped shutters rolled up and rolled up, with a pair of yellow eyes looking at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a few steps back and opened a big suitcase with Martin being pulled apart from his limbs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You said that as long as I tell you the truth, you won't kill me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin turned The eyes looked at the shadow on the top of his head, and his jaw was knocked out, and he groaned vaguely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, but I don't believe it, so I need to prove it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony for him Pick up the jaw and pick up a bucket of liquid on his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Smelly dead."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin complained, but he soon did not speak The container slowly found a thick and terrible head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's called Merrill, Amazon Mori, who has been a nanny for Sasha for 5 years. But now Sasha no longer needs a babysitter, so I decided to take it. Returned to the rainforest.” Anthony explained: “I am sorry to have soiled your clothes, but Miri is always dismissive of food without the blood of the Caiman. This is a small secluded... well, now Do you still want to say that you just admit the wrong person?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After rejecting Mori’s dinner invitation, Anthony stepped out of the carriage and did not have time to lock the compartment door. I heard an ecstatic voice: "God, Mr. Hopkins, Mr. Hopkins, you are here! You are not in the carriage!~ Haha, that's great!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The messy car owner laughed and ran over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Great, you are not in your car."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is my car? ??<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
