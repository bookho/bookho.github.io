But after knowing its value, as a sangdi, such behavior is tantamount to a hidden provocation - he turned to challenge the teddy bear series, the top of the teddy bear display also has a top prize, this Barbie is more dazzling than the simple shape, the gold-lined fur, the pure gold nose and mouth, the sapphire's hazelnut, the iris of the diamond, bright under strong light to be invisible - Besib I twitched the corner of my mouth. "Do you think this kind of bear will feel comfortable?" he whispered, and Sasha Hopkins licked his lips and gave a sigh of laughter. Besib shook his head. A vulgar taste can't be tolerated even by him. "Even if it is worth five thousand," the son of the sea god island thug leader casts a chip: "I don't want this." He aimed at a rare midnight blue. Teddy bear, it has only one beer mug, but the weight is not light, and the claws of the gripper are too loose. Maybe it has already been used up by luck, and Besib has been caught for ten times before it is put into the exit. Teddy The bear fell out and Sasha took it When it came out, the bear dexterously turned a few turns in his palm. “The fabric is made of sailor alpaca, complemented by blue velvet. The left foot is printed with the “steiff” brand crystal logo.” He squeezed the bear’s belly: “Old Andriana would like it, 2006. The work is limited to 1,500. The market price is around 1,200 yuan, and the "real" purchase price is only about one-half or one-third, including the previous Barbie, which is on the auction floor. The price is 550,000, but according to Hopkins, the diamond hanging on the neck of the doll is taken down. When ordinary jewellery is sold, its price will only fluctuate around 150,000 yuan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this does not mean that Shane Battier will allow them to inexplicably disappear from their own eyes, but in the presence of Hopkins and For the time being, he is not ready to recover his loss, and he is very likely to count the account. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone once said a joke - a casino owner signed a donation book with his doctor’s persuasion, and he died as a result of an accident on the operating table The doctor opened his chest, but only found a huge stomach and gallbladder - no heart. There are also liver and intestines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's the next one?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That fancy mohair."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It looks very old," Besib swayed his head incredulously: "It's all hairy." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One of the most classic works of 2002, limited to only five. The fur is high-grade Angora wool and mohair, which was intentionally made like this." - so that it looks like an antique." Sasha said: "Catch!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at Besib, he is The way the boys get together is full of curiosity, and in terms of status and status, it is higher than Hopkins’ son than Sangdi. In fact, a young man with a big devil's name showed a certain obedience to Little Hopkins. He didn't seem to mind acting according to his friends' wishes, even though he had his own thoughts—why? Sasha Hopkins is indeed more old and calm than his peers, but in the opinion, Besib, who seems to be more rude and impatient, has his own care and caution. - Not everyone (regardless of size) can endure trying to get back (or many times) in the face of almost a huge amount of wealth at their fingertips. He didn't even look at it again. It seems that the string of diamonds worth hundreds of thousands of yuan is made of glass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, what he showed was not a service, but tolerance, and interesting. Little Hopkins seems to think that this obedience or tolerance is no big deal. He can see that he is a thoughtful, responsive boy, but facing Besib. Instead, he will be a little absent-minded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intimate, and infinite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former can be done by many boys. But the latter is not necessarily. Also at this stage, how arrogant and arrogant the boy is in adolescence, he is clearly clear that it can no longer be clear - the male instinct will force them to do their best in the group (even if only two) The pros and cons, the behavior caused by the impulses dominated by hormones can not be avoided even by the brothers - the more excellent, the more competitive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was thinking about it, Besib caught the third teddy bear, it was only gray, about the length of the arm. Di, he was satisfied with the three teddy bears of midnight blue, suit and gray in the armpit, and the three heads from small to big protruded from the boy's warm shirt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I feel enough," Besib said. "Old Andreas would like them." He pulled out one and kissed him on its black nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the biggest reason for the stop of Besib is his stomach, he is hungry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest that they try the most famous sea and land restaurant in Paradise Palace, the most famous of which is the live Breton blue lobster that was specially airlifted. There are also truffles and figs, goat cheese, olive oil, herb-flavored lamb, sweet oiled salmon and fresh asparagus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib hesitated for a while: "I want to order big chunks, oily, sesame and peppery barbecue, as well as The creme brulee and almond butter cake, and the round black olives and frozen sparkling wine," he looked at: "Where do you think these are there?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I blinked: "Fortunately, we have a very good cafeteria."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like every restaurant in Las Vegas, Paradise Palace buffet The restaurant is set deep in the casino. Everyone who wants to eat has to walk through a row of neatly arranged Macs, as well as those seemingly innumerable Sic Bo, Baccarat, Roulette, Blackjack. , Pai Gow gambling files. The lighting is pleasant, the air is fresh, the black tie, the staff in the white shirt's pay and bet continually picks up more or less banknotes with a flattened small pole (they are not allowed to touch the banknotes by hand), pushing Back to the different colors of the chips, symbolizing the victory, the failure of the pleasing sounds and the calm and steady singing of the sounds one after another. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many people can endure? After you have finished eating, you can still draw a lottery – when the prizes are between $5 and $100? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may tell yourself and others that you will only use the free chips, even if you are not close to the table, you just have to look at it. Then go to the redemption counter. Change this chip to cash - you think so, but according to the survey, only one of the 100 guests can do this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This free chip will be like a match, screaming at the greedy savage of human beings deep in the heart and deep in the brain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib grabbed the biggest teddy bear, he remembered the boys, they gathered in front of the doll machine, face The expression that appears on the top is not much different from the gamblers who gather in front of Sic Bo and baccarat. Heaven Palace, to be precise, all casinos have established amusement parks. Surrounded by the amusement parks, there are at most prize-winning game consoles that have just been seen and tried by Besib and Sasha. They are colorful and varied. The prize is full of temptation, it makes the children familiar with the casino, familiar with the chips, familiar with gambling, familiar with this special way of entertainment brings the thrill of a roller coaster ride - just waiting for them to be full. The two magnificent doors of the casino will open up – welcoming another batch of new offerings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought a little out of God. When he heard a scream, he only had a slight slanting over his body, avoiding the body that suddenly hit him. His elbow was rubbed, and the teddy bear fell. On the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; has also been affected. The man who rushed out of the corridor just inserted him and Besib. He was hit by the back and almost fell forward. "What is this all about?" he whispered angrily: "Is there a devil chasing your ass?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, "The slamming guy gasped and replied: "It’s more about kicking my ass. He just wants to tear me apart."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha helps Bessie Bu was picked up by the teddy bear. When he just wanted to straighten up, he saw a pair of blue eyes. Clear blue, and curly blonde hair. The boy gave a slight glimpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blue eyes quickly looked up and down him, estimated to be determining the identity of Sasha, she extended her hand before Sasha retired, Sasha Staring at her for a few seconds, sticking out her hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is this all about?" Duplicate, but the subject of the inquiry changed: "Judas?" He glanced at the already-drawing sand. Young women who stand up, she is a fake gambler on this floor - gamblers will avoid the gambling of empty ones, when the casino will send some well-dressed men and women to act as fake gamblers to attract business, they The chips are provided by the casino, and it doesn't matter if they win or lose, because they have to return all their chips to the casino before they finish their work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is quite boring, there is a need to perform the work of the skill, the blue eyes are the people, she has always done a good job, and never fainted. Put the chips in your pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are guests who order her into the room." Red hair said, "Regular work."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I refused." Blue eyes said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She does have this right."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, but that doesn't mean she can Abuse," Redhead said in a cold voice: "That is a 'guest', we can't make him unhappy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ivan." Blue Eye Supplement Dao: "That is Ivan," she said, moving her voice very low: "I won several of them today. When he gambled at the dealer's position, I... at least won him 50,000 yuan. She twisted her fingers with anxiety and tears: "He was very annoyed, and I was a skunk that brought him a bad luck. (He... he spit at me and left the table. - Then, after a few minutes, Judas let me go to the 'room'. I saw Ivan when I opened the door..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
