			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chiz Carson looked at Catherine and pulled Boa Douglas into an empty ward, and their posture was clearly going to last for ten hours. The actual situation is - they only took five minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Carson had to work hard to converge on her doubtful eyes, Boa. Douglas’s face was very poor. If you really want to describe it, it is a person who has been hungry for a few days and nights without swallowing a pot of hot oatmeal and found that this pot of oatmeal is simply a vomit that someone just pours out of the stomach bag. Things, when Boa. Douglas's look became more horrible and Catherine laughed loudly, she realized that she actually said this sentence unconsciously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although I am not happy that someone describes me... as a vomit," Catherine said without hesitation: "But it is really appropriate." Nothing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boa. Douglas knows that he is better to turn around immediately, he has got what he wants, and the ubiquitous addiction is comforted. He can spend comfortably for about two weeks, then sink again into the nameless itching, heat, cold, pain and insomnia - he is surprised that his control and acting can be so strong, he I can't get rid of this woman's control, but I can hide this fact very well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His father, Mr. Douglas, only knows that his son likes to be a wife who is too old to be his mother, but he only has a feeling of love. The daughter-in-law complained about Boa. Douglas’s worrying and strange hobby – he would arrange a suitable wife for Boa, but if he could understand it a bit deeper, he would definitely go back to the hospital in the first time. The sperm that he has sealed and the egg that his former wife has preserved re-synthesizes an heir—what can be used by another person, not his own son? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rude words of Chiz Carson made him want to slowly hang this little smash, at least fifteen minutes, but she still said wrong A little, he never thought that he had swallowed a pot of oatmeal. From the beginning, he knew that it was a disgusting garbage in front of him, but he still had to eat because he was "hungry". Going crazy - his life seems to be on this. Except this, he doesn't want anything - he used to be so cautious, he never stopped like other boys before he understood what he called "abilities." Trying to ingest alcohol, taste cigarettes, and those white powders that can be dangerous... Even after becoming a power, he has never tasted his uncle's herbal tea, and that herbal tea can be enjoyed by ordinary people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was Catherine who destroyed all of this. He deeply remembered how Catherine reached out and asked him if he wanted to feel the pleasure he had never had before - he got it, he couldn't lose it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He loves this woman, more real than Marcia, but she only rewards him with deception and contempt, Boa. Douglas wants to be a surgeon, so He can put her completely on the dissection table, carefully cut her open, extract one organ after another, especially the heart, he has to look through it carefully, looking for anything inside can prove that he is not in vain Evidence, he would pinch that thing tightly in his hand, use his tongue to lick it, and then swallow it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result of the stun of Sasha is the anisodamine, which is derived from the mandala. The white angiosperm has the highest toxicity of the seeds. It is hollow. The roots completed the injection, and Boa had a very accurate weight. Before entering the operating room, Sasha was briefly awake for a while—the doctors who operated the surgery were all people in the organization. They were familiar with the abilities. In fact, They are much more relaxed than their peers. The ability of the abilities to heal themselves does not require them to worry about organs, blood vessels, nerves and bones. The most important thing for the surgeon is to get those muscles, The skin, the hard bones and the soft viscera wrapped up pieces are taken away, and the little things stay in the body, even the abilities will feel very uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A golden spotted on the treetop of the sycamore tree in the hospital, looking at the head and trying to understand everything inside, it was a little hard to do so. Perhaps because of the relationship between the eyes, it is not the bird's eye, but the human eye, and the eyeball oppresses it is not a big brain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rich did not go to class, he was lying on the bed in the dormitory, his headache was splitting, but he still insisted - he needs to be Sasha Hopkins The latest situation was passed to Anthony Hopkins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He will wake up later." The doctor said to Catherine and Chiz. "We have taken out all the things, really a lot, he can consider opening a small hardware store in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine gently touched the sand Face, indeed, he fell asleep and slept very well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Dr. Anthony Hopkins on Poseidon Island is coming here - he does not need to carry luggage, Chegaler Bissan He loaned his helicopter and pilot to him, and within an hour of his decision, he left Poseidon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
