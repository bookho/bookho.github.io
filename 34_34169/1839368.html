			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two more ones............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I found you a protector." The man said to Avery: "Not so surprised, I am just an insignificant little person, although I appreciate you, but I can do it." I only have to save myself. I want to fight. The one you want to fight against is still impossible. Fortunately, I have a friend. He still has a little power. He has something to do with you and your sister. Deep sympathy, he is willing to help you, of course, you need to continue to work hard, dear, just a football player will make him feel that he is bloodless."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I will do my best."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is best."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... Are you working for him too?” Avery asked, he still remembers what the man had said to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It can be said," said the man. "Don't worry so much... the French owe is not as much as you think - my friend, His relationship with that one is not very good," he said. "I can make that one unhappy for a while. For him, this investment can be said to be rewarding."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avery’s footsteps suddenly messed up and almost stumbled on himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Isn't you used to your new body?" The man smiled and said: "...or do you think of something else? If you want the adult to intervene directly Your sister's case - I can tell you now, impossible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked with a happy mood and said: "We are not one with them. Class people, as the people of the previous class, are not allowed, nor can they go directly to the people of the next class to directly confront the people of their own class. You must know that people are more irritated than the enemy. Once he did this, all the people of the previous class would unite to deal with him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gave Avery a look. The boy's face was covered with anger and shame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe you have to say that we are in the early 21st century, the slave society is a thousand years away from us. The feudal society is five hundred years away from us, the so-called The class was wiped out in the wave of innovation three hundred years ago. Unfortunately, boy, I have to tell you. Classes always exist, each class has a distinct division, with a strict circle. You can't see it because your circles are not allowed to see more things, but you can't see them, it doesn't mean they don't exist - for a simple example, you think a person is born in a slum I have been drinking cheap milk powder for three years. I will be mistaken when I write a word. When I was a child, I sold my body by my mother. Is it a class that depends on the sinful boy and you are a class? You may say yes, then Can you tolerate him as your friend and neighbor? Do you dare to let him close to your sister or girlfriend? Do you dare to drink the drink he brought? Do you dare to sleep with him in a room? When your loved one, Friend because you have a good relationship with him When you are far away, can you insist on continuing with him? Do you have a common topic with him? When you want to play rugby with him, he just wants to share some cute little powder with you. You think this is a crime and suicide, but for him, this is a generous sharing - when he finds you and claims to be murdered, do you believe in him?<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you want to fight with him? Do you want to try the taste of prison? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or you will give him some money. Give him some food and clothes - there is only this, you have done it right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look, this is still your possible friend, and you are just a humble little employee, and haven’t even really used it. The reward you want to get is far more than what you can pay for - too greedy is not a good thing, boy, this is the first time, I warn you if there is a second time. I will apologize to my friend and tell him that my vision is too bad, I am wrong, believe me, he may not do anything for you, but as long as he withdraws his protection, it is me. It can also let you thoroughly become a pile of stinky garbage that even dogs can't smell. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avery is stunned, he is facing such a straightforward and fierce threat for the first time, and he can still read *naked from inside Disdainful and cruel, the man looked at him like he looked at the flat-faced kitten. He patted Avery’s shoulders tenderly a few minutes ago – he was shaking, but even his voice Can't send it out.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm a bit too much?" Sorry," said the man. "I forgot that you are still a child. I will remember to remind you later. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lifted his broad palm and touched Avery's back.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Free couldn't hold on anymore, he squatted on the floor and vomited.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Jessie woke up and saw the unchanging white roof.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was still unconscious when she was thrown in here, her gun, watch and The mobile phone was taken away, the clothes were replaced, and the hair and body were cleaned.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This room has only one door, no windows, no walls Wrapped in a beautiful wainscot, Jessie puts his hand on it, still feeling a hint of coolness through the board into the palm, she guessed it was a basement, fresh air and warm wind from the top of the ceiling less than three inches The grille mouth blows into the room, with the scent of roses, the floor is covered with heavy floors, and the floor is a milky white sheared carpet - probably wool, Jessie can't recognize it, has a bed, Dressing table, dressing table full of a year ago, she can only look at the magazine's enjoyable cosmetics and jewelry, really gold, platinum, diamonds and gems; there is a wardrobe, the wardrobe is filled with beautiful clothes, if two The root strap and a cling film are also considered clothes - the other end of the room is a small but well-organized bar, placed against the wall, the large freezer is filled with champagne, wine, whiskey and chocolate, cakes and other messy ready-to-eat Food.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bathroom is connected to the room, the wall facing the room is glass, transparent glass, a circular bathtub that can accommodate four people while bathing inside, and the pink-colored heart-shaped bed is facing it. If someone is taking a shower inside, the person lying on the bed can easily and easily see it - Jessie also finds a row of buttons that can almost match the TV remote control at the bedside, she tentatively presses One, the bed immediately vibrated, press one more, and the bed popped up with a scorpion containing a lot of lubricants and condoms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She gave it a hammer and the scorpion retracted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Martin!" She jumped out of bed and shouted, she knew there would be a dialogue device. There may be monitoring probes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She shouted a few times. Without a response, it is possible that he just walked away - she thought, stuffing her uneasiness and horror back into her body and taking a large piece of chocolate and a small bottle of blended wine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she rips open the chocolate packaging. The door lock of the only door turned a little, the door opened, and the door was first explored with a large bunch, and there were hundreds of red roses, and then the head of Jessie’s bad boyfriend. He is a handsome young man, but somehow, there is always a kind of impulse to shoot his sloppy face and blow it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jessie’s heart fell to the ground at once, and she didn’t even dare to think if the person who kidnapped her was not the big boy who wanted it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dear. Sleep well?" he asked, seemingly not feeling that he was facing a victim of a kidnapping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jessie stared at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't be like this, Jessie." The young man said with a good temper, walked over and inserted the rose into the mouth of the marble sculpture that Jesse thought was a fish. Jesse looked carefully. I discovered that it is a male character that is intentionally beautified, thanks to my boyfriend's hopeless aesthetic! She said in her heart, how many shameless idiots he saved! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I saved you." He fiddled with the rose and made it look like what was pouring out, before turning his head to seriously Speak to Jessie. "I can't believe you will be a - you didn't expect them to monitor your email? You are closely related to the idiot looking for death - I mean, partner. Your mailbox is in front of them. The open book, they want to see it," he snorted. "And, the damn public phone, yes, you remember to avoid and ruin the road monitoring. But now you will use the public phone. There are not many people, they have dogs, electronic instruments, and us, remember the Catherine I told you? She can guess who you are by touching the phone - and besides you. Who will go? What about the call?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They have killed Mike!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, why not, there is no big difference between dead and dead," her boyfriend said with his usual idleness. The accent said: "The number of people who lost their jobs last year has increased by 50% compared with the previous year. Every week, there is a coffin that needs to be covered with a flag. You are one of them."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you let them think that I am dead?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, just missing." He sat next to Jessie: "Know After you have done something, I know that I have to hide you quickly. I am doing it very timely. Those northern children are looking for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" How long do I have to stay here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The prosecution period for murder is up to twenty years..." Her boyfriend said very seriously: "You can Think about it, we can have a wedding here, and then you can give birth to me - twenty years, you can give me a basketball team."<br /><br />& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jessie’s answer is a straight punch that can hit his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey," he said, "Please don't be so violent - well, I just want to make a joke," he suddenly became serious: " But what I said is true," he kissed Jessie. "The situation outside is not very good. I will look at the situation to determine what to do next. If everything goes well, I will try to take you away." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where do you take me?" Jesse said: "Smuggling to go to Nepal?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Not very likely,” he said. “I am also a strictly monitored person.” It doesn’t matter if you just stroll, but you can’t leave the federation, leaving the control of the organization<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Jessie didn't believe that before accepting his quest, she checked the information of this guy. He was a stunner who had the privilege of inheriting most of his parents' property, but he was not arrested except for the speeding ticket. I haven't been investigated and asked. Who will spend the energy and time to monitor the small locusts in such a society? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal just was just that she was open to the letter - smuggling is a bad idea that can’t be worse, it’s also a crime, as one, she has a natural The resistance, and since those people can use the North, the "Masoyye" who holds most of the smuggling system may also be their partner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take you to my ... work place," her boyfriend said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jessie laughed: "Where are you working?" They don't spend a lot of time, but he also has time to go to work, but Jesse I Check, he knows that he is in a certain pastime - she thinks she will be furious, but what people can't believe is that she is so calmly pretending to know nothing about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can't tell you now." He replied quickly: "But you will know it later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The only institution that can provide the best shelter for Jesse is that he has to work hard recently, otherwise their "head" will not easily let him pass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before working for the organization. He still has to go out of his own private work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the child." The man lying in bed said, double The gauze surrounds the entire bed, and Martin can only see a human silhouette in a vague way. The sound he hears is strange. Very ambiguous, like a person who is not willing to open a mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martins dumped the data from the file pocket, and the photo was clipped to the top of the document with a paper clip. This is a good girl who is worthy of the cardamom, healthy, eyes Bright, the skin is not white enough, but it is smooth and has no freckles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just killing her?" Martin asked: "Do you need me to rape her? Or do you want to burn her into black charcoal?" he said maliciously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man behind the gauze shrank a little, and Martin’s words reminded him of the pain that the flame brought him: “No. Just kill her.” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just add another 500,000," Martin said, he now has a beloved woman, he buys a lot more: "You have to cut it off." Is her limbs?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let her die," the man said, pressing the summoning bell. Martin couldn't help but put the photos and documents back into the bag, giving up the possibility of a fare increase. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give me three days," Martin said. "At most three days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man's secretary came in. He watched Martin in a hand-painted shirt with vigilance, as if he was watching a mouse covered in locusts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Martin pulled his shirt shirt provocatively, just a piece of clothing he recently loved. The picture of the erotic palace from an island country is drawn above, and the color is gorgeous. Imagine bold: "This is called ukiyo-e - a group of people without aesthetics." He shouted, slipping out of the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you call me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can give it in three days Does this person send a banknote?” His employer said, “But you can't let him know the source of the banknote.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“How much are you going to send? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three million." Two million thanks to them for raising Fanta Wharton for two years, and another one million is his apology - Because it is him, they will lose their daughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Secretary did not raise any doubts about his approach. In the face of this employer with hundreds of millions of assets, he only needs to be cautious and complying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Wharton is lying in bed, his body becomes hot from the inside out, and Martin’s maliciousness brings him back to the hellish night – he The wife was unbearable and committed suicide. And he is alive, even if he is sitting on an astronomical asset, what is the use? He can't see the sun, can't drink water, can't dance, can't date a woman, he can't even have a child anymore - he thinks he has a daughter, the little devil-like Fanta Wharton But this young man with awkwardness has caused him a bad news. The organization he worked for found her body in the process of tracking the "Ghoul". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His hope was shattered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He once gave a reward of three million yuan for Fanta Wharton, he gave Martin a million, as a reward for the letter, the rest of him Prepared to hang on the "Ghoul" reward, but Martin gave him a call, he stopped the action, no matter who is hard to believe, the agency secretly sold the name of the reward to those who were rewarded, Martin saved his life. He wanted Martin to kill Anthony Hopkins, but Martin said frankly that he didn't have enough money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
