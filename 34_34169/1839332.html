			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bebeb walked through the long corridor and pushed open the door to the east side of the building, adjacent to the room of the cliff and the sea, Cheka Le Bissand is not eating, which is rare for him in recent years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come in, my child," Chegal said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boy came in and closed the door. His height was close to the adult. Even if he didn't get close, Chegal could feel the vitality of his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sit down, sit on the chair opposite me, there is lemonade on the cabinet over there, and pour yourself a cup."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about you?" Besib said respectfully: "What do you want to drink?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Give me a glass of soda," Chegal said. "I also want to taste the flavor you like."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishb from the cabinet Remove the two bottles of lemon soda on the soda bottle. The soda bottle is condensed with transparent drops of water. It feels cool and straight to the palm of your hand. When you pour them into the cup, you can see the broken pieces of ice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blinds of the room are open, it is consistent with the windows on other buildings on Poseidon Island, green, high and narrow, the blades can be turned, stainless steel, open and The shutdown is controlled by the motor and is connected to the alarm system. The strong sea breeze blows into the room. The small furnishings in the room - the rocking pony, the photo frame, the rosary hanging from the bed, the small cross and the bottle Margarita flower was shivering by it, and Besib looked outside. The moonlight tonight was very bright, and the silver light on the dark sea was like black with silver and small silver beads. Velvet blanket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ruler of Poseidon Island, the godfather of "Masoy", the leader of the mob, "Tang" sip a bit sour and sweet in the cup Beverage, this kind of drink has not been touched for decades. The situation that requires a long time to speak can also have been seen for decades. Since he inherited his father’s position and one of the brothers After the burial of the nest, he did not seem to be so hesitant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishb. Bisangdi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the sake of safety, the child’s childhood and childhood can hardly find traces of Chekal and Bisang, but he is Pei Pei. Masoye’s ringing iron hoe, a calm and strategic executioner, is not a twisted and squeaky maiden, nor a hypocritical hypocrite. Who put the poetry sentimentality into his body? Hopkins? Anthony Hopkins is a madman who can make Peppi also frightened. He did not join the family, but he stood firmly on Poseidon Island with his extraordinary talent and viciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha, he is still a child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib is also a child, a voice said in the heart of the godfather. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened his eyes because of thinking, only to find that the child sitting in front of him was very nervous - not superficial on the surface, but "Tang" I have seen too many people being nervous in front of themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When the Western Confederation was not established, it was ruled by several large countries and dozens of small scattered countries, 'Maso Yeah's already existed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boy was a bit confused, he didn't understand why Chegal. Bisangdi suddenly mentioned this topic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is our golden age. There are many smart people, there are many capable people, and there are countless loyal people, even if they are just peripheral members. He also knows what is called a slap in the face. Be cautious; weak and timid, people are ignorant, the army, the judge, we can buy and buy, the threat is not to buy. If we do not accept the threat, we will kill it directly... We bribe politicians and manipulate the election And support, every bill that is good for us will pass quickly within a few days. The bill that is against us will enter the shredder when it is not submitted to the president’s desk. When is the marijuana? Be legal? When will a small amount of drugs be exempted from criminal prosecution? At that time, the godfather of the time spent so much energy and money for this. But he succeeded, he got through the brightest pass Since then, 'Masoye' has become the largest drug supplier in the entire Western Continent.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In those 20 years, the drugs of the entire Western continent Yili, "Masoye" accounted for 98% of marijuana. Sixty-four percent of cocaine yin, fifty-three percent of Hailuo yin, every minute has a banknote like a wave In the arms of the people of Poseidon, we planted opium poppy on hundreds of islands, and purchased containers of opium from the south. There are specialized laboratories and personnel to study how to better refine natural drugs and manufacture semi-synthetics. Synthetic drugs.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All people are crazy. They thought that this business could last for a long time and never stop, but suddenly there was such a day, the government fu suddenly said ‘no. '<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All means suddenly lost, and the judge no longer accepts gifts and checks, the prosecutor refuses to meet with our 'consultants', we support politicians because of scandals Being impeached, our restaurants, hotels, casinos, were seized or ordered to suspend business for rectification, Otaru was arrested in prison, big men were monitored and controlled, and every country was against us. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to put away our hands and feet and block our faces, just like the octopus being chased, changing patterns, resizing, drilling into the dark and concealing Going in the nest - but the drug business is still in full swing, because the profits are too big, too tempting, people who have tasted honey can not drink bitter medicine, no one wants to close, they are willing to take risks, even In order to suffer from the murder, we must also carry out this sale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When my father became "Tang", the Sangdi family still provided one-third of the "goods" for the drug trade in the Western continent. People are used to it, and turn a blind eye to the dangers hidden in the aftermath of profiteering, but I don’t know what to do, but sometimes I think, why do we have to do things absolutely impossible? The drug trade can never be legalized. It will only become a terrible cancer that is attached to a country. It is stinking. It sucks money, takes away life, brews crime, and on it, you can’t find anything. You can't even collect taxes where you use and praise! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look," Chegal. Bissandi spread his fat palm: "I thought so." For the people of Poseidon Island at that time, it was tantamount to deviant and self-seeking dead roads - I couldn’t go straight to my father and uncles and put my thoughts out, I could not refuse to take over a drug business, or It is deliberately messing up, lest they treat me as an incompetent idiot. I did it, and it did a good job. When they regarded me as a truly talented person, I asked my father that I wanted to open a logistics company. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to admit, I used the little means of the Poseidon Island people, my logistics company suddenly got a few big lists that can be eaten and eaten for several years, My truck ran around the highway on the entire West Coast highway, delivering a variety of things to my customers - my brother laughed at me because I gave up the most profitable business and didn't do it - In the next few years, I opened restaurants, banks, garbage collection, gasoline sales, investment in real estate, tourism, and development projects. I have done a lot of industry, and several of them have a lot of income. It’s not long before someone comes. Ask if I can join, I am happy to promise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they get enough money from me, I will ask them, want to be like this, stable, long-lasting, and legally take a little less money? Still continue to do the drug business? I don't force them, they don't bother them, they are willing to do it all. What do they like? Some people go back, but more people stay. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have achieved my goal in this way," Chegaler concluded. "Although it is not complete, it takes time, twenty years, three." Ten years, forty years... Besib, my son, waiting for me to die, then your work. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a sip of water.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, there is little Abby, you And Hopkins is not bad... In fact, I am very happy with Hopkins," he said. "But we all thought we had to wait for a while - when we came to us, we were really I was really taken aback. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishb was a little bit uneasily moving the cup.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't show this expression "Celegar said softly: "This will make me sad. I am your father. What do you think I will do?" Just because you have such a lovely thought? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I was a bit surprised - but this is a common problem for young people, it’s not good for me, I didn’t notice it - when you deal with John Carson Very good, so I was negligent. But Besib, I think you are a little misunderstood, we are not the devil, no need, we will not kill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We never despise gentle, good-hearted people, we only hate right and wrong, hobbies, and bloody guys on the lips, this is listening It's a bit contradictory, but this is true. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially you, someone who will sit in my position in the future, the people in the committee will not be happy to see a violent jump because of two sentences When you have little trouble, you will be nervous. Before you get the consent of the family members, you can freely ask the executioner to give someone a 'sacred meal' or a 'Tang' who believes in conviction (referring to murder). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As long as the person is not betrayed, does not violate the rules, does not hurt his brothers and sisters, then 'Tang' is necessarily a kind, generous person, this is Very normal. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
