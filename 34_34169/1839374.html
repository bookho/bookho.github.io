			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ps:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorry, a few days ago, because the computer was broken, it was missing for a few days. Update, I wanted to add more chapters today (confidence is full), who knows a phone call, is called to work overtime... Come back late...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Tired... Sorry, the adults, the next few days, and the National Day (I will not go out) will continue to add more! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine bent down and stared at Boa. He was a handsome, slender young man, perhaps because of long-term and frequent training. It is more sparse than the boy of the same age. The skin is like an alabaster, but his manners and shapes are exactly the same as the garbage and dross that Catherine often sees in the streets of the night during the first two decades of his life. Like a dog that has been slain, the softness is like melted tar, sticky like a chewing gum that is spit out, irrational, too lazy to think, they are immersed in a world that is not human. Self-satisfaction and enjoyment - they live in this world, is a punishment and threat to others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little Douglas’s hand fell on her shoes, and the fingertips swayed like a big beetle’s spiny claws on the satin upper. It is a pair of black satin shoes, embroidered with the same color, the pattern of passionflower, but the sole is bloody red. Catherine stood up from the chair, and the silky touch of the silk touched Boa. Douglas’s face, he smelled bitter The soft and elegant atmosphere of orange blossom and white amaryllis, as well as the warm body fragrance of women. He closes his eyes and opens his eyes. Under the moonlight, Catherine's dark gray silk skirt is like a snaketail in the moonlight.蜒 蜒 , , , , , , , , , , , , , , 金色 金色 金色 金色 金色 金色 金色 金色 金色 金色 金色 金色 金色 金色 金色 金色 金色 金色 金色 金色 金色 金色 金色 金色 金色 金色 金色 金色 金色 金色 金色 金色 金色<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She went out and left Boa Douglas alone on the floor of the hotel. She took the elevator downstairs and walked out of the hotel, the waiter at the front desk— - That is unfortunate. Because the "head child" temporarily borrowed the body and was directly rushed into the hospital by the ghoul, eagerly asked if she needed to call the car. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just want to walk around here," Catherine said. ,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A person?" The waiter said, "Sorry, I didn't want to look at you, but you really don't need to be with you?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Grand is a calm place.” Catherine said: “And I am not here for the first time. I just want to smell the jasmine flowers.” The hotel has a large garden connected to the hills and the lighting in the garden at night. It will last until two in the morning. The place where the jasmine is planted is not far from the hotel, and it is only about two or three hundred feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course," the waiter said: "However, after all, it’s a bit cold, then, when you come back, you might want to have a hot egg. "Wine wine?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes," Catherine said, and she subconsciously wanted to lift her wrist to look at the watch. But she always had a wide bracelet with a combination of hundreds of sapphires and the same number of diamonds on her wrist. She turned her head and looked at the sky outside the door, through those lead. Cut the pieces into pieces of glass. Estimated in my heart, replied sympathetically, "I like custard, I sent it to my room at ten o'clock."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The commander." The waiter replied respectfully and gave her a slight bow. This waiter is only euphemistically asking her where she is going and coming back, if it is ten o'clock. There was still a black hole in her room, and if nothing was left, he could take action. If it was ten years ago, she might feel impatient and violently cocked the thorns, but now she knows that this is also a kind of responsible and vigilant performance – perhaps for many people, it’s just nerves Allergies and nothing happens. But for Catherine who has suffered and seen countless attacks in the dark, she is very grateful to the waiter's concerns. There are many times when this kind of trouble and trouble may save your life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waiter watched Catherine walk out of the hotel door and then bypassed the left corner of the building. The lights illuminate the lawn and vegetation, presenting a green road to the guests. This beautiful young woman walks like an elf or a female fairy on this bright and vibrant road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no quiet place in the garden, and several guests and people in Grand Town are taking a leisurely stroll through the trees and flowers. The people around Catherine, both male and female, can't help but cast a look at her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine did not notice this, she walked forward with a heart and mind, and went all the way to the jasmine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jasmine has a long flowering period, Grande is very warm and humid, but in a few days it will be in November, and Jasmine’s last flowering period is also Coming to the end, the dark green shrubs are scattered from the white flowers, like the little stars in the night sky, but they are still so fragrant. The huge flower bed with a small round table and a seat around the round table is prepared for those who are tired and have a deep hobby for Jasmine. Dr. Anthony Hopkins occupies one of them, facing one. The bushy jasmine, it has no signs of decay, fresh is like a companion in June. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine sat down opposite him, covering the jasmine flower. In her subconscious, this creature, known as human beings, can be regarded as a kind of wrong and filthy creature that does not deserve anything as beautiful in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you seen Boa. Douglas?" the doctor asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Knowing the question, Catherine thought, you let me see him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you let him touch you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," Catherine said: " Didn't you say that? Don't let him touch me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't drink water and eat in front of him?" Anthony Hopkins said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, no fights and farts," Catherine said rudely. "I have been on an empty stomach for eight hours."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Very good," said Anthony. "The hollow air will make you look melancholy, thin, pale, and temperament. Have you coughed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"No."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Hopkins looked at Catherine, his blue-gray eyes were like some kind of light in the dark Inorganic, he suddenly reached out and gently touched Catherine's bare arm. Catherine slammed back and almost knocked over the chair, acting like a fierce snake biting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don’t always behave like a cat that has been blown up," Dr. Hopkins said softly in his voice: "The dense little cockroach is really not "People like it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is something I can't control."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our course Can control," Dr. Hopkins said of course: "As long as you want to."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not changing, Catherine once again groaned, but she is very Wise up another topic wisely: "You make me..." She chose a word: "Do that thing, I understand, but why do you want me..." She pulled the dress, Her clothes, jewelry and shoes were all prepared by Anthony Hopkins. He also invited her to a ceremonial teacher. He asked her not to make some in front of Boa Douglas... How to say, What humans need, indecent acts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because Boa Douglas needs not a girlfriend, nor a mother," Dr. Hopkins said: "What he needs is a goddess."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I?" Catherine said, "I can't get along with the goddess." She knows what she is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who knows," Anthony Hopkins said irresponsibly: "He is looking at you anyway."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then why do I still want to..." Catherine moved her body irritably. She didn't like the clothes, and she didn't like the jewelry (although it was valuable). I like this kind of shoes (it hurts her toes!) - Since Boa. Douglas can't wait to jump into the trap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Deep addicts who are addicted to drugs throughout the day will also have a sober time," Anthony Hopkins said. "And we want more than just Keep him away from the sand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When will I be..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We also For two years," Anthony Hopkins said: "Cooperate with me and let his goddess be ingrained in his mind - before I say good, Catherine, Sasha Hopkins vs Boa. For Douglas, it’s always a forbidden word. You have to keep this in mind, otherwise we might have to let Boa. Douglas die.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Catherine keeps silence. If she wants to sprinkle, she will not be soft-hearted, but... as Anthony Hopkins said, it is easy to kill Boa, but things will be difficult to deal with later. The impact of sand is particularly large. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Douglas is a rare good game, but it depends on how it is used and when it is used," Dr. Hopkins said. "But you have to know Here, Catherine, how your predecessor lost Boa. Douglas's admiration and love - she made two mistakes. First, she let Boa. Douglas knows that she is just a bitch who will go to bed with a man; Second, she stood on the enemy side of Boa. Douglas."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Boa. Douglas don't know if I am the aunt of Sasha?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, you are a little lucky than Marcia," said Dr. Hopkins. "Boo. Douglas is focused on love, affection in his brain." It’s a meaningless thing. As long as you keep a distance from Sasha, he won’t doubt that you are a lover of Sasha.” He didn’t go to see Catherine’s face that became more stupid because of his mouth, and continued: "--Do you think he understood the relationship between you and Sasha? He is stubborn and self-conscious. The little bug, I only believe what I saw and heard, and what I thought of myself, and that’s why, even if Ferguson Douglas prepared more, stinky, bad evidence, you are His mind is still a pure and charming goddess - but don't think that he will be compliant with you from now on, you have to be careful, the goddess may fall from the altar or just take a look at it, pay attention to his eyes and words and deeds. Read the memory and feelings at any time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
