			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avery didn’t believe Sasha’s words, the door was closed, the window was six feet above the ground, and Hopkins didn’t look at it. Didn't call it, how did he know that Besib was not there? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha turned and walked away, leaving Avery alone. Avery sneaked away, picking up one eye and looking in it close to the door. There was no light in it, and the sun was about to disappear - even if it didn't, its light might not be able to illuminate the room. - The square small window is only one foot square, not inlaid with glass but louvered ventilation strips - Avery’s only vague glimpse, he hesitated, and his mouth was only attached The door of the tiny gap: "Bishb, Besib," he pressed his voice, screaming sharply: "Beyond the land!" and the back side over the head, replacing the position of the mouth with the ear, he heard the sound of the flutter Is it that Bishb is moving? The boy listened with enthusiasm and hoped to hear a response or complain, coughing and sneezing, snoring... He waited for five minutes and didn't hear anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took out the mobile phone and called the captain of the football team. The captain quickly answered. He sneered at Avery’s “unexplained” fear, yes. They are a place to change their mischief, but they are definitely not dangerous. They are measured: "Unless a coward is scared to death." The background sound is very noisy, like in a bar, like in someone's At home, they are in the carnival, Avery should be one of them... Avery changed his ears, he could hardly hear what the captain was saying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't worry, we will remember to let him out," the captain said impatiently. "It's so ridiculous!" He hung up directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He straightens his body, the six gods have no owner, he wants to go to the coach, and suddenly stops, by the river. In the shadow of the little mill, there was a large area with a purple oak forest. Hopkins stood straight, his face slightly raised, his hands crossed in front of his abdomen, his eyes closed, his body Zhou was filled with misty light, Avery looked up at the sky, the sky was covered by dark gray clouds, no moon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to be attracted to what. Avery went involuntarily to Hopkins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins opened his eyes when the two were less than three feet apart. He looked at Avery. Avery has never seen such an eye. The bright ripples flow on the iris, and the crystals flicker, just like the whole Grand River is stored inside, beautiful. Very beautiful, and because it is so beautiful, it doesn't feel like a living thing. Avery is like a demon, and his limbs are stiff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins turned his head back and was silent. Suddenly, Avery heard a screaming voice, which he thought was raindrops at first. Then I thought of the hail, and the sound of the beat continued. There was no cold and hard thing on his head and body. One dark and dark spot fell from the sky, broke into the gap of the branches, and the leaves were chaotic. The ground fell. The decaying branches of the dried ups also fell, and a new grave was piled up on the ground—the number of “things” was constantly increasing. The latecomers pushed the predecessors who occupied the good position. They quarreled, and countless sound waves like metal friction met in the woods, and Avery’s brain was about to explode. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins’s lips moved, and the surrounding area was too noisy. Avery couldn’t know if he said something, the sound suddenly disappeared, so Unexpectedly, Avery thought he was jealous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A branch was bent down by an outsider, just in front of Avery’s eyes, with several ears that made him creepy. He knows what it is - bats, hundreds or even tens of thousands of bats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the way out, Sasha Hopkins has considered which animal to call, the Grand Boarding School is located in the middle of the valley, the river On one side, the building is old and huge. The school building is surrounded by forests and shrubs. There are countless animals growing here. The most impressive number is the mouse. The birds are second, and the number of bats is the third, but he finally chose. Bats - lack of light at night, affecting most birds, and the repaired and modernized Grande, mice have many places to enter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bats near Grande are basically brown bats, which cover almost the entire earth, and the small brown bats are only 1.4 inches, and humans The thumbs are almost the same, and there are also some mustard bats, wide-eared bats and long-legged bats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avery only recognizes that they are bats, he looks at a huge black bat that glides from the top of the tree, in Hopkins The sky was lifted up, and it fell lightly, hanging upside down on the boy's fingers. The light from Hopkins illumined it. The scorpion's flesh-colored pig's nose and small teeth in the lips were clearly visible. Hopkins bowed his head, but his lips didn't move. They just played the mime like a face-to-face look. The humans raised their arms and the bat was slammed into the air. It opened its wings. It was like a signal. All the bats were excited. They pushed the hanging branches and flew them up. The previous sounds like the hail appeared again. They rushed out from the top of the pressed woods and scattered in the deep blue sky. Open, like a black bean that was thrown out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Avery didn't say a word from beginning to end. In fact, he didn't even dare to take a breath. He wanted to make a joke. For example, Hopkins acts like a witch a thousand years ago, but how is he? There is no way to say this as a joke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...they...is it going to find Bisang?" Avery said that his temples are hurting, he doesn’t know why he has this. The idea is too crazy: "Can you find? Really?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm." Sasha said, "Can find."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that they can go to the coach or the grade instructor, and then they pressure the old team members to say where to hide the Beib. Bissau, but it is too slow, This is an old tradition that teachers can't easily ignore – and, Sasha Hopkins must also consider the possibility of a one--if this is really just a trick of Douglas? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bat is a better flying creature than birds and insects. Its speed may not be the fastest, but it is the most dexterous. The small brown bat is even more capable. Unobstructed to sneak into any small gap, and if necessary, they can climb and drill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two boys waited for a few minutes in the open space between the trees, and a long-clawed bat brought news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the water tower," Hopkins said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Water Tower?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty bats are rolling and gathering in the air, they Followed by, Avery noticed that they were walking along the river. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dam pointed out that the water tower is an antique. It was used by the grand teachers and students two hundred years ago to use the small mill when they were frozen in the river. Built of drinking water, red brick, about 30 feet high, with heating and pumping rooms below, rectangular and arched windows on the ground and second floors - now Grande does not need it However, after the discussion between the school committee and the teachers, this semi-abandoned small building was retained because it occupied a position in the history of Grande. The heating device and the pumping house were regularly refurbished. The teachers will take the students to visit and allow them to drive the pump to fill the water tower and grind a bag of wheat in the mill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sturdy low arched arched door is also locked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In...inside..." Sasha ran too fast, Avery almost left him, he pressed his chest, there It hurts like a tear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha did not speak, the keen sense of inherited from the ghoul played a role, the operation of the machine has stopped, but he can smell the lingering in the air The taste of metal friction and oil evaporation, "I'm sure," he said, "Avery, go to Mr. Chenneck (he is their age instructor) and other teachers."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can try to get in," Sasha said quietly. "Come on." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avery gasped and looked at the bats who were still flapping their wings around the water tower: "Okay," he made up his mind: "You are waiting here." I will bring people soon, don't do dangerous things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course." Sasha said: "Look at you."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the encouragement, Avery snorted and ran away, making sure that the distance was far enough, Hopkins returned to the door and locked the door. Is a mortise lock embedded in the door, sprinkled After studying for a while, I took out the keychain from my pocket. There is a decorative gold-plated t"t" cross on the keychain. The vertical length of the "t" is thick and the surface depicts a small icon. It can be pulled out, with a so-called old-fashioned universal key that is commonly used by Gypsies, and a small hook at the top. He inserted it in, turned it, tried it, and slammed, the door opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inside of the black hole, the oil and metal tastes stronger, the eyes of Sasha shine in the dark with silver light, and he has no night vision ability. Turned on the light and jumped directly onto the stairs. On the top floor of the second floor, there was a small black iron ladder. He climbed up the ladder. The top of the ladder had a cover for repair and cleaning. The wind at night was very Anxious, it seems that he will be pulled out from the top of the smooth water tower at any time - the lid is also locked, and there is a stick in the lock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha's half body is pressed against the lid, he leans over his ears and knocks on the lid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
