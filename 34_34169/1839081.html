			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Martin and Mary are dead."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two spots on the screen are made up of From big to small, gradually annihilated, Catherine touched her eardrops - it would faintly hurt when she was emotional. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is an email from Maria to the agency."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind her Jack patted the induction keyboard: "I turned, you look."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine opened the encrypted email, the content is very simple, She read it in detail. "They met the 'Black Sacrifice' and his victims." Catherine muttered: "This email is timed, why not immediately notify the organization? Why?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack casually bites the gum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Money, Catherine, they have seen the money, the rewards of the parents of the missing children have reached as much as $50 million."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maria does not."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But Martin will." Jack kicked the table and swung the chair with He swayed for a half lap and stopped. He looked at Catherine from behind the brown sunglasses: "Don't be like this, Catherine, you can't indulge your feelings like this, it's not good for you. Now go report to the boss. And, application, you know what to apply for, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe I can't be 'sense' like you." Catherine at the end The two words aggravated the pronunciation: "But this does not mean that I will be slower than you. Jane and Raul tracked the black sacrifice in Venice 2 hours ago and have been confirmed by the agency intelligence department, that is to say, Martin I met another dangerous guy with Maria. According to the regulations of the organization, we have the right to pick them up as their direct superiors. I will file an application with the boss immediately."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you, Catherine, you are very understanding."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack yelled at her back and put her feet on the spotless plexiglass table, igniting a cigarette. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "God, then I was in that part of the problem and wanted a girl to be a partner?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two jam egg rolls."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, good soon, a total of eight Ten cents."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After taking the egg rolls handed by the hawker, Catherine took a bite, hot and sweet egg skin and The orange jam is mixed together, and only this unusual sweetness allows her to temporarily forget Jack, the boss, and the indifference of other colleagues in the organization – neither cold nor enthusiasm, human life is theirs. In front of you, just a photo, a number, a reagent, or other inorganic matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of the 21st century, with the richness of material, the lack of spirit has become a tumor of mankind, and madness, crime, homosexuality, drug abuse and even suicide are traditional. The anomalous behavior that philosophy ignores is filled in every corner of society; the media that caters to the dark psychological requirements of people – whether it is newspapers, magazines, movies, televisions, networks, constantly creating or creating new dangerous characters, cruel killers, shameless The swindlers and the kidnappers of the state of change have become a kind of "weird" heroes. Countless people copy their clothes, talk, and even act. Of course, there are people who cannot agree with this phenomenon. That's why. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The institution was originally a small group similar to a private detective agency that could not survive with the "idol" type of criminals. After being controlled, the members almost increased by more than ten times, the most of which were psychologists and theologians. The most madman - Katherine is not maliciously thinking, although she also has a bachelor's degree in psychology. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and those who are similar to demons are not a lighthearted thing. In just five years, at least one-third of the analysis team People are schizophrenic or suicidal, which is the minimum, because there are still undiscovered missing persons, the action group, that is, the person responsible for hunting, the casualty rate is higher, and the death law is strange; so the members of the organization never What kind of sympathy will be expressed to those who are unfortunate, because maybe tomorrow, or even the next moment, they will end up in a more miserable end. It’s better to analyze the data or enhance their ability. Maybe you can let others live for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am just a little unaccustomed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caceline whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is not used to? I am a sentimental bird, Jack is bullying you again?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp A girl who is about the size of Catherine smiled far away and waved to Catherine: "I am going to dance, come back and comfort you."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, Emma."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emma once again launched a beautiful smile, although it is a kilometer away from Katherine It was filled with noisy people, but she could easily hear the response of her friends with her own ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The composition of the Action Group can be roughly divided into four categories according to their purpose. The first is a rich salary and a more attractive bounty share - Usually one-tenth of the people attracted; the second is because of the cruelty or even killing of relatives or friends, for the sake of revenge or anger; the third is to show their own different wisdom or ability The fourth person is originally a criminal... This sounds a bit ridiculous, but what better way to know a wolf than a wolf? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Emma is a third person, she is rich, young, beautiful, healthy, and warm home, she and Catherine, and Maria Different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maria..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is an orphan with Katherine. Katherine thought, at least to bring her a rose, she touched the eardrops, although she could not touch anything, but she knew that there was a small chip inside, no, it would not be like a certain In some sci-fi, it will explode or spurt out toxins. Its only function is to confirm the position of the wearer, life and death. In the words of the boss, even if you die, you can at least tell the companion that you are chasing. Where did the criminal finally appear? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Belong to the light spot of Mary, the last place to disappear is Cape Town, Africa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the unfortunate incident of the explosion of the sixth carriage and the disappearance of the passengers in the second carriage, "Lobos" had to delay his trip for the first time. Passengers will stay in Cape Town for six hours and then set off again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The passengers didn’t complain too much about it. On the contrary, they were very excited. They knew that many of them didn’t have such a strong beat. The terrorists, the explosion, the mysterious disappearance, all this is too dramatic! They even gathered in the dining car, sipping African wines and rooibos fragrant tea, and held a small tea party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hundreds of blues."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony holds Sasha, half-squatting on the ground, in front of them is a strange plant, 4 meters high stem, exposed The ground is only about 20 cm. There are two pieces of leathery leaves that are born from the top of the stem and separated from the left and right, lying on the ground, with a leaf width of 30 cm and a length of about 3 m. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The longest can be 6-7 meters, it has only two leaves in life, the base of the leaf is hard and thick, and it grows continuously and falls on the ground. The tip of the leaf is soft and thin, and it is constantly damaged. After the leaf flesh rots, only the wood fiber is left, and the coil is curved... You can touch it gently, it is not poisonous."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha said that it was a little surprised to reach out and touch the mo, and the leaves were rotten and worn out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They can maintain this self-tortured way of living for a hundred years...is a very interesting plant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two people who did not participate in the meaningless and interesting conversations left the morning in Lobos, and there are many places in Cape Town that can spend 6 hours. However, Sasha chose the Kettersborn National Botanical Garden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this proposal Anthony certainly agrees, he is also trying to collect some special seeds and leaves, in order to add some unique flavor to the future life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, this leisurely two-person world has not been able to stay for a long time. First, Anthony felt a slight commotion not far behind, and then sprinkled the sofa. A sigh, because she had heard someone screaming while calling her father's name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Hopkins...Doctor, are you a doctor?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young The woman shouted and wanted to pull Anthony's arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony stood up with Sasha and escaped the hand without revealing the trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am a doctor, can I help you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My Son, my son, he suddenly twitched very much... I don't know what to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha pays attention to her face, she is very thin The woman, groomed with neat brown hair, muddy blue eyes, pale complexion, wearing a very strict suit, is not like a person who loves to go out, she is likely to fall in the run, because Her calf part has a large area of ​​off-line, and the skin inside has a red scar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha remembers that she is called Cha Lisi. White, also a passenger of "Lobos". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day before dinner, according to the custom of "Robos", each guest enters the dining car, there will be a waiter who respectfully names the name, because she was wearing The same set of suits, so Sasha recognized her almost at a glance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is eager to lead the way, turning a corner, Anthony and Sasha see a boy who is only about two years old, dressed in orange, curled up Under a tall phoenix tree, the limbs kept twitching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony put down Sasha, kneeling in front of the little boy, he has his lips purple, his eyes turned up, and he horrible white from the biting teeth. Moe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
