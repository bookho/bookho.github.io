			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quinta is the clown and advocate who can make the dance party noisy and hot. He has a playful tongue that is not inferior to his mother. He sneaked around like a squid in the sardine cabin, distributing chocolates and sweets, praising girls, praising men, holding them together, and a mixed-race girl who was more than that. The dancers and partners, when the dance is ringing, this stupid girl and Quinta will take the lead to jump into the empty venue and lead the people to dance together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Quinta thinks, there are many girls who are coming to Besib and Sasha. Bishb’s market is better than Sasha. The girls who like Sasha are big girls. Yes, the second and third grade sisters, because some people will serve before going to college, so some of them are already adults. They noticed at the opening ceremony. The little boy who shines in the sun - not necessarily doing something, but dancing, a little face is still OK. The senior boys are almost all coming for drinking. The third-grade and fourth-grade students who have been forced by the 36 compulsory courses in Manchester have no love and time. They also have no love. Dancing, dancing with the new students is extraordinarily polite, but when you jump with your own grades, you have to be crazy and warm, some of them will quietly leave in the second half of the dance, behind the bushes, the bathroom and In a dark corner, one or more long and happy ** vents the accumulated pressure of many days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They dance, regardless of elegance, small step dance, just, Latin, tango, waltz, brisk... I’m still jumping around before the end The rabbit dance is very naive, but everyone likes it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha’s roommate, the incompetent, uncharacteristic, faceless and unrecognizable Richard. White is tightly held by a drunken senior girl. Holding in his arms, he was dragged and dragged like a doll. His face was stuffed into a pair of basketballs, and his face was flushed and his feet were weak and weak. He looked like he would faint at any time. When he met Sasha's line of sight, he couldn't wait to cast a look of pleading and despair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey," Sasha said to the broad-eyed senior girl: "I don't want to bother you, but I think he is going to vomit." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The senior girl looked at Sasha in confusion and looked at Richard White in his arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is still wine in the bathroom." Sasha whispered, and Richard was let go. The girl swayed and swayed to the other side, trying to cross a whole chaotic crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After touching Richard, Sasha found that he also drank a lot of wine, his skin was like a fever, his feet were weak and weak. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you want to go back to the dormitory?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, vomit..." Richard said : "Take me... go outside, I really... I want to vomit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha dragged him out of the encirclement of music, alcohol and women. The air in September was a bit cold, the air was exceptionally clear, and the vegetation lights were shining on the lawns, trees and bushes on the side of the road – beautiful blocks like emeralds, especially against the dark skies and the earth. Dazzling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air is filled with the scent of night scent, jasmine and sweet-scented osmanthus, and the lemon-yellow-colored street lamps drop one after another in the gray-black and brick-red ground. Aperture with a gradient effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard vomits intermittently behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha stood in the direction of the wind, looking around boredly, he noticed that a senior boy, Sasha, was impressed by it. Because he sent a card to every girl in the first grade that he met, the card has his grade, phone number and name, promised that he can help them anytime, anywhere, as long as there is time - this is obviously too much hormone The young man is kissing a girl who is about a first grade, the girl is leaning against a tree, and the boy is trying to insert a leg between her knees. The intention is obvious, if the girl is willing - this is nothing But in the second half of the kiss, the girl began to struggle, she put her legs together and constantly pushed the boy out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the vision of transcending ordinary people, Sasha can clearly see that the boy’s ass-like red face is full of anger, he Roaring to the poor girl, waving her arms, pulling her back, where they are from the road, no street lights, and the girl’s strength is much smaller than the boy who may have grown up – he dragged her down and picked up her dress The hem covered her face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Sasha is ready to act, another person has ran over, running her while taking off her shoes and picking up her own skirt. Knotted above the waist, she forced the ball from the panicked girl and kicked him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
