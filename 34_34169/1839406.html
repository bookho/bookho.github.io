			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brian DuPont has accepted nearly two decades of education, both private and in school, but in any case, it does not include "putting yourself The option of becoming a hero, ordinary people know that when you see crimes/fires or other natural or man-made disasters, the first priority is to protect yourself, then call the fire brigade and the police station - not to mention DuPont DuPont has always been a selfish family. In order not to let family property be lost, they can marry their blood relatives and breed their offspring like the Egyptians 1,500 years ago. You can still count on them. Cultivate a Batman or Superman? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brian Dupont didn’t even have a helmet, and in a short glimpse, he saw Avery’s legs tremble, the pillars anytime, anywhere. It will fall down and be connected to it to cover a concrete floor of a living room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avery. Famo’s mother is not so small that she can be pinched in her armpit. She is very fat and her waist is raised. Like an unconventional rugby, they were blocked by broken cement blocks, protruding steel bars, dumped iron seats and some oddly shaped wooden wrecks. Brian didn't even know if he could get her out. - He looked up at Avery, Avery looked at him, opened his mouth, he seemed to say something, but only a short hum could be heard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Persevere." Brian Dupont said that he slammed over the obstacles and thanked God, who wore a pair of heavy leather boots and jeans today. But even then, when he tried to pick up the mother of Famo, he was still almost pierced by a small section of steel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This discovery made Brian a cold sweat, but he didn't have time to think too much. He didn't even notice Avery's grateful eyes. I started to climb out, right, climb, and I had a weight of two hundred pounds. When the ground was flat enough to put down one foot, he couldn’t get more attention and strength. There were always gravel hitting Brian's head, and his eyes were gray, so he had to scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brian didn’t know how he climbed out, he only knew that when he was covered in light, people swarmed and dragged him away from him. In the danger zone, he heard Avery's mother telling them in a weak voice that there was still someone in the hall and getting an understanding, and he fainted with peace of mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Five minutes later, ambulances from nearby hospitals roared and they took the patient and the injured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Smith was also injured, but he noticed that Sasha Hopkins was taken away by an ambulance that did not paint the hospital. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at his hand, Hopkins’s blood stuck to his finger, and he and another doctor cut the clothes of Hopkins He did first aid, but was surprised to find that his internal bleeding had almost stopped, his organs, muscles and skin squirming and healing at a speed visible to the naked eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You may have heard..." His colleagues swallowed: "There are people who are different from us."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes...I...know." Dr. Smith said with a short breath, he looked around and was stunned to cover a sterilized gauze. The cracked mouth above: "I know." Manchester Hospital has information on the abilities, slices and cell tissue specimens, but Dr. Smith is not qualified to contact them, but he did hear that - the abilities are not I will go to the general hospital for physical examination and treatment. The government has appointed them to the hospital. This is the first time that Dr. Smith has been exposed to a living abilities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who came to pick up Sasha Hopkins took everything in the tent, including the waste, the cotton balls and gauze that took up the blood. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Smith took his cryopreservation box from a nurse before climbing the ambulance, which contained an ovarian tissue, but now it’s just a piece Full of bloody stainless steel fragments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome to Boa. Douglas is a fist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine is not like a woman in some ways. She rarely uses slaps when she fights, most of her fists, and her fists are still very hard - she also Wearing a large ring that can serve as a tiger, the ring left a deep mark on Boa. Douglas's white face, and it was so deep that Chiz Carson could read the sentence easily - It is the two words from the rumors in the Bible, the road to death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
