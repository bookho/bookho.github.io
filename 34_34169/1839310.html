On the track, the bill on the prohibition of children's boxing has been submitted to the parliament for consideration; a large number of children in Tani are sent back to the country; adult boxing gambling is revived in large gymnasiums, but their masters have become dwarfs. But the black and strong Poseidon Islanders and the northerners who were covered with bells, cymbals and daggers; Besib and Sasha returned to the school. In the final exam in January, the performance of Besib was only seen in Sasha. Said to be unsatisfactory, he told Besib, in the next three months, the future Heijing Island heirs should be able to make good use of every second time to see if he can get a beautiful mid-term exam at the end of May.

Said: "Going into the office, taking out the exam papers, taking them down and putting them back, coming out, it is really simple for her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, my God," Besib said, "I like her!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you have to be disappointed," Sasha said. "She likes it. My dad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beep: "I seem to have heard something quite bad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I think so too." Besib said: "You What was that?
