The ones to be aware of are Boa Douglas, unfortunately, Mr. Douglas needs to find a way to regenerate an heir, Besib. Bissau is alive, Lor is living first, Brian Dupont is alive, Catherine is alive, and Sasha Hopkins is alive - carrying him in that Yes before the ambulance disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Celegal.The room in Bisangdi is silent, everyone is watching Anthony Hopkins, the history and thoughts of Poseidon In the middle, the disappearance can almost be equal to death. They all know that his son is the only weakness of this elegant and dangerous guy. It is a relief point for peace of mind. Because of this, the old man can tolerate Anthony Hope. Kings gradually became a man on the island - like the idiots who would unconsciously relax their vigilance when they saw the beast with cute cubs, but they did not know that the beast was the most terrible - who There is no guarantee that the chubby cub will not do anything, right? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere in the room was tight and gloomy, and Chekal. Shrugged over the land. "Need help? My friend."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you need help, I will not open your mouth," Anthony Hopkins said with a smile: "But I have a hunch that this guy on Poseidon Island may not be able to send anything." Use."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony and Chegal have a lot of "good friends" in the Western continent, and the information they need will be transmitted at the fastest speed. In the most difficult time of this period, Hopkins first asked Chegal for a person, the one who would play with fire. I also went to see the old Andriana who survived the last attack and turned into a vegetative, and Pepi was surprised to find that he was busy in the kitchen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a weirdo.” Pepi said to Chegal: "If it is me, I may need to eat, but I will not Go cooking."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little bit of squid with lettuce and olives; the strip of tenderloin on the inside of the spine is mixed with garlic, and thyme is simply marinated. . Pan the pan a little. Add fresh rosemary and black pepper powder; stir the liver into a puree, add salt, pepper, butter, and knead the strip. Packed in oil paper, rolled into a roll, plus a small onion - home liver mud roll. The wine is a red wine produced by the people of Poseidon. The only special thing is that it is mixed with the blood of Sasha Hopkins, in order to deal with the old Andriana. The doctor smoked 500 milliliters of blood from Sasha, and he drank about a quarter of his weight during the operation. The rest of him poured into a bottle filled with wine. Ghouls experimented long ago. For blood, pure wines can extend their shelf life more than other methods. And the taste of the wine will become unique and rich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tenderloin is arsonist and the liver is old Andrea. A few grapes are used for dessert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has something around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Jesus said, I tell you the truth, if you do not eat the flesh of the Son of man, do not drink the blood of the Son of Man, there is no life in you. inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s weird," Sasha slowly retracted his sight: " I am not surprised at all. Mr. Chennike. Or do you have other names?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You can also call me Mr. Samuel.” Mr. Neck said that he is still the same. With a smile on his face, his face is ruddy, his eyebrows, his hair and his beard are as white as snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, Mr. Samuel," Sasha said and said, "I can know what I am going to face?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"唔..." There is a hint of mercy in Samuel’s eyes: "I can only guarantee that there is no pain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Now sleep, child."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doctor on one side always looks at Samuel and immediately twists the gas valve of the anesthetic after getting his order. The anesthetic that was tested on thousands of abilities was instantly effective. Samuel crouched down and looked at the young man. He was not afraid or desperate when he learned of his unreversible fate. He The calmness of the face is like entering a beautiful country with mother's arms and warm sunshine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a beautiful child, Samuel thought, he thought of Gregory, he wanted a copy of Hopkins, for him Face and body, and Samuel’s goal is to be broad and sublime. He will get enough children from Sasha Hopkins to have the same abilities, and he can make an ordinary person a versatile person. The child, he knows that many people (their president is one of them) have felt that the abilities are too many, but in his opinion, even the percentage can not get an integer is far from qualified, he looked at him when he was a child. After a movie, the protagonist is a bald head marked with x. The reverse character is a tight-fitting madman with a helmet. They each command a group of people with special abilities. The tight-fitting madman once did one thing, that is Turning those who oppose the abilities into abilities, that is probably the most important thing he has done in the whole movie. The quality and quantity needed to promote a society’s change, the quality lies in those who can Can the powerful person who speaks be able to speak? The same feeling? And the quantity lies in people. When your friends, your classmates, your colleagues, your wife, your son, your brother, or even yourself become the abilities, how can you fight against the abilities? What about? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Samuel felt that he was born for this, otherwise God would not give him such power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as the abilities have only two digits, some people have done cloning experiments with the abilities of the abilities of the abilities, but they all fail without exception. It’s like having the will to allow them to do this – but Samuel, who has the ability to transfer one's power to another, can stop the bad changes, so just have He, they can clone clones with abilities, although most of the clones can only survive for a short time, the abilities will be weakened and distorted, but there are also one or two successful cases (although All they have are little tricks like igniting matches or moving coins.) <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a place in the organization, but this is not what he wants, and one day he got a competent prophet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prophet tells him that there will be such a boy who can make ordinary people become abilities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finally found his own path. If Samuel was built for this boy, he could not go anywhere. The "institution" is too complicated. The forces of the non-powered are ingrained, and they will not be happy to see the powers everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Samel found the boy according to the description of the prophet, but he was too young, he had not grown to that age, he had to wait patiently, fortunately It doesn't take long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything is so satisfying. Until he saw the black robe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows who it is before he raises his eyes, when there are two pairs of eyes that pay close attention to a target. They always inevitably collide together - Stronge. Stefan, priest, he was the victim of a closed backward community. Another rebellious, a priest, a spiritual changer, a serial murderer. An actor, Samuel also wanted to get this guy. Extracting the good part from his cell, you can't control a person who has already formed, but you can raise a child according to your mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stifan knows what Samuel wants to do, and Samuel knows what Stefan wants to do. After all, his file was quietly in the cabinet of the bureau and the FBI. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once he got Sasha, he would not hesitate to cut the boy’s throat, just as the Jewish sacrifices cut the lamb’s throat on the altar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Samuel looked up. He has considered Stefan and Anthony Hopkins. He even thought of Besib. Bissand, but he didn't expect it to be so fast. They were still on the way, only two hundred miles from the damn ambulance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This room didn't have a good soundproofing effect, but he didn't hear anything, and he smelled bloody. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I only need a small part," he reluctantly suppressed his fears and uneasiness: "a small piece of skin, a small piece of meat, a small piece of internal organs A little bone marrow - it won't hinder what you have to do next."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can't get anything," said Stefan. "He Does not belong to anyone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha opens in his own world eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood in front of the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, the door no longer exists. When he transmitted the power to Brian Dupont, he felt that it was not right, but it was too late. After considering it, afterwards - obviously this monster is cleverly disguising the door or keeping it inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You shouldn't call me that." The bastard hidden in the light said: "I am you, not an avatar or part, I am you." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about that," Sasha said tiredly: "There will be people who will kill themselves."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"A bad-throwing threat," said the monster. "But I can still remind you that it is not a good time to debate with me. Someone is preparing to put you on the altar."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame swept the entire corridor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Hopkins passes through them, those orange temperatures that are as high as a thousand degrees Celsius orbiting his neck, arms and ankles, docile Like a group of small animals that have been cooked, everything is burning. Only his skin, clothes, and the road under his feet have never been poisoned by flames, but the air is hot, full of steam, smoke, and harmful gases. The voice of Huhu and Bibo, occasionally mixed with the huge boom of something falling down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corpses that traversed the corridor and in the room were mixed with other ash, and the last glass door melted, deformed and burnt at high temperatures. Hopkins pushed it away, and it split into countless pieces in the flame that was subsequently chased. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He’s connection with Sasha has been going on, but it’s intermittent, the memory palace of both is obstructed by the thick fog, he can’t go there. The clues of the kidnappers can only be searched for by the words and phrases of the ghouls transmitted by Sasha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been a lot of police cars and fire trucks outside, as well as ambulances, no one noticed that a tall man with gray hair is leaving quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flames with the ghouls left, followed him on the plane, out At the airport, it was so eager to move, and the anxiety was hard, but the strong will of the human being had been firmly controlling it until the destination, and the shackles and shackles on it were suddenly loosened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go," said its second owner, "It’s time for you to do whatever you want."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;This is a magnificent and special building. Although most of its building materials are hard to ignite stone and metal, weaving blankets, silk and linen are everywhere, and dry wood and paper are erected. . The space is empty and the oxygen is sufficient. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Hopkins only lost a little attention to the flames, he will face the accumulating sects for nearly a hundred years of accumulation - they are called elders and Monk, nun's power. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghoul drove the flame into every tiny gap, sweeping through each plane, and driving out the people and mice inside, some of them even When I saw Hopkins' face, it was swallowed up by the flames, and the water in the baptismal pool was boiling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone is using a gun. correct. The bullet that had faded out of the coat screamed and turned to the back of the ghoul, and shot at his kidneys and thighs; the broken stones splashed around, and the burning wood illuminates the face of the mural. The branches of the luminaire were reddened by the flames. It hovered dangerously in the air, winding around Hopkins's neck, leaving a black mark on his shirt collar; crows and pigeons with a pointed mouth under human urge Claws. Crazyly fluttering the wings of countless Mars in this sacred and huge hall, their screams are like a group of little devils; a marble saint tries to hold the ghoul tightly. Just like a human being held tightly with his lost son; the ground cracked, the walls opened, and the seats seemed to have been given new life by the flames, and they oppressed Anthony Hopkins. With the vicious and passionate emotions that cannot be described in words, they are like Zhang Luowang, which is Zhang Luowang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They shouted. It was like a peasant who was burned alive by witches and wizards in the Middle Ages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Hopkins closes his eyes. Open your eyes, the flame burns slowly, and the elders, nuns, and monks' bodies are squatting in the flames and bending gently and shrinking, the skin rolls and the oil creaks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spirit of wanting to invade so many people in chaos is not easy, but when their thoughts are highly concentrated and they do their best for one goal, they become Much simpler, Hopkins built an illusion that they wanted to see with Andriana's ability. It has an increase in the ability to spread. It is more credible and more lovely than reality. Then he only needs to be light. With a light push, they push them into the world they want. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be one or two fish that slip through the net, and the flames chase them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Anthony Hopkins felt stinging and cold, deep into the bone marrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consciousness of Sasha disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stefan cut the throat of Sasha, he thought he would Seeing the white blood, just like the little lamb before, but he saw red, thick and bright red, hot red, viscous red, they jumped out of the blood vessels that bound them like a beast. , rushed to the priest's face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a step back and the knife fell on the altar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since he was expelled from Baiyancheng, Stefan learned to never question himself, so he believed that he saw it, he saw the light in his blood. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first it was just a flickering point, then it became more and gathered together, they came out of the body of the sacrifice, they surrounded The body wandered around and was as curious as a child. This behavior lasted for a few seconds. It returned to the body after the last week. With the blood, the wound healed, the traces were eliminated, and the breath recovered. He was paralyzed. Rubbing his eyes, sitting up while showing a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned to Stefan, his eyes have light, but no emotion, he is not human. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stefan wants to scream, a hand has been placed on his throat, something infiltrated into his body from the skin that touches, a spoon digs in his body, looking for it, when it finds itself When you want something, it turns into a fork, deeply pierced and curled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I may say thank you to you," "that" said: "So, I think you can see what no one can see so far. Things - your strength source."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fork becomes a hook, which hooks up the internal organs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White light floats from his black sacrifice, which looks like a snake struggling on a hook, a thick snake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your ability is very strong." "That" said that his smile became real: "I am very happy to find you." Although this human spirit The world is really chaotic and peculiar. In many cases, it has to follow his thoughts to avoid being discovered or resisted by him. The pale golden messy little lamb is like this. Fortunately, the end result is as it wishes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stefan feels that he has been hollowed out, and he has gone far away, taking away temperature and strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That" will be in the hands of Stefan's power. "Great." He said that the twisted light snake gradually disappeared. The white light covered the purple-blue iris and the black pupil, but Stefan could still read the meaning of lameness from his voice. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He ate his strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Hopkins first saw Sasha . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Correctly speaking, the body of Sasha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the ghoul's gesture full of malice and provocation, "Good evening, Dad," he said. And jumped up when the last syllable disappeared. Like a squeaking serpent, he rushed to Hopkins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attacker can completely avoid it - if not subjected to an extremely effective and intense attack, in the brain, in the mind. The connection he had with Sasha was connected in a rude manner. He could see the destroyed tower. The thorns of light spread in the fog and stretched out to the other's house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gripped the throat of Hopkins tightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thorns wandered around. Once Sasha was so familiar with the mansion, he did not care about the luxurious halls and rooms. It straightened out to the cave that smelled stinking all the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop," said Anthony Hopkins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thorns paused, it trembled, trying to get rid of this order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You ate it," "that" said. He kept his hands on the doctor's neck, leaned down, and the cold breath hit Hopkins's cheek. The light is slightly dissipated, and the purple-blue eyes are opposite to the maroon eyes: "You ate the little thing that always screamed. This is his power."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly smiled, and couldn’t help but kind of: "Do you know? Sasha has already given him a name. He called him Calvin, a little bald. He decided to accept it two days ago, then you eat. It's growing." His smile is getting bigger and bigger, more and more crazy: "Do you really love him? Or do you just love Sasha? You just need Sasha, you turn a blind eye to Sasha's pain, you know He has a part of Catherine, the part of justice, the part of kindness - you know that he tortures himself for your mistakes and cruelty, and the solution you give is to let him tear and abandon that part? God Ah, he still believes in you, he is a naive fool!" He shook his head: "Why don't you eat him? You ate his mother, ate his son, why didn't you eat him?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This way," he said, including Tears:. "I will no longer feel the pain" <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; ghoul looked at him, look calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course," "that" said: "If you don't want to, I can eat you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flames burned, and Sasha woke up in a cold and nothingness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dad?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(End of text)<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is really the ending I thought of at the beginning, but some of the outlines are really changed. I can't write the darkness of this article. Well, in my original outline. It’s not so annoying. She and Sasha have a whole sweet and gentle chapter. They have no children before. They sacrificed some of their bodies for the sake of Sasha, like her name, Chiz- - the food of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Sasha’s emotional contradiction is often mentioned implicitly after Poseidon. I hope everyone notices that the ghoul was thinking at first. To change this, but he loves Sasha, he does not want to kneel, so Sasha remains the same, although this, as it is, as it is now, is very unfavorable to Anthony Hopkins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a small fan outside, and it is easy to explain the ending of others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ps: This is an open ending without errors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You will be the oldest president of the Western continent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Constitution only stipulates that the candidate must be older than thirty-five, and there is no upper limit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "But voters only like young and handsome candidates."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When the war or economic downturn, they prefer the steady old guy, especially the old The guy can bring nearly 10 million jobs to the country."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you accusing me of bribing voters? Well, I admit But I would rather they call me handsome, in return, can you help me with this knot? What is it called, Eld tired? I said that a steady old guy is suitable for this kind of knot? I What is the dressing consultant thinking?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In order to make you look more intimate, this knot is very popular now."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think you are too tight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, I just think this will remind you to be more cautious and cautious. Think about your last speech. Your crisis adviser is already asking for a raise for the third time this month - you can no longer be like a wilderness on the island of Poseidon. Childlike - don't lick your mouth? You have been over the age of spoiled for ninety years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think - that's because there is one The guy who is the same age as me is still a little daddy's relationship. What did you receive two days ago? Hazelnut jam soft heart handmade chocolate?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It’s just a short message,” Sasha said. He took two steps back and admired his work, blue, black and gray pinstripes, full, triangular, rich layering, and the tie knot was perfect: “Let me know that he is still alive. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's hard to imagine, when will he be shy?" Besib controlled his tentacles and did not dig between the tie and the shirt and the skin. Void. "He's not bad, at least better than Chekal. Bissham."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is your father?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will have my eighth younger brother in March next year. What about Catherine?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She has already It’s spread throughout the Western Continent.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;”Baoer. Douglas finally did a good job—Catherine who lost the white matter of the front of the brain is much more lovely.” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This kind of life is more suitable for her, well, at 9:15, are you ready? Wave to your voters, steady and handsome old guys "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I remember to come to dinner at night, my wife has not seen Marttina for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "If your crisis adviser will not come to me to cry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I promise not, then eight, please on time, Hopkins Member."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Eight points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the door of the room was closed, Sasha Hopkins took out a chocolate from his pocket, which is what Besib said. Heart handmade chocolate, he peeled a piece into his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
