			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jinxin bought a blanket, this blanket is made of Merino wool and silk intertwined, feels smooth and warm, texture Light and soft, whether it is used for covering or paving, it is like being wrapped in clouds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She put the blanket on the couch that Dr. Douglas likes most. The recliner is black leather, the blanket is milky white, and the corner is embroidered with a small depth. The red rose, the three are very well matched, Dr. Douglas saw it, smiled at her, and the smile was full of deep meaning. Jane quickly bowed her head. She didn't know if she had blush. Maybe, maybe, but she didn't, but she knew more about it. That is, she was particularly impatient today. The last member of the club was almost driven away by her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The work of extracting and modulating the fragrance has also been completed, she opened the window and the door, the wind passed through the room, the temperature between the extractions dropped rapidly, Douglas lay In the chair, I watched her every move with interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After completing the preparatory work, Jane remembered to close the door and lock it. When she walked through the window, she hesitated, didn’t close, the window was facing a smell. The sweet gardenia, the breeze blowing through her hair, she can imagine what it would do in a few minutes after it blows on its own, sweaty, sensitive body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She took off her clothes and walked toward Douglas. Douglas admired her body and was full of breasts. He couldn't help but think of another woman who had frequent contact with him. Marcia's body and face were lacking, but she was very strong, with a vibrant wildness, perhaps because of the hours of immersion in the water every day. Her hair is very sparse, and the skin covering her solid muscles is always tight. When she is about to reach high tide, she will use teeth and nails. On several occasions, I almost left a wound that could not be healed on Douglas, and her zuoai was like fighting a smooth walrus or a shark with sharp teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas turned his head and kissed Jane’s mouth and hair, stroking her flaming hair, whispering in her mouth, praising her beauty and meekness, he always showed Not so anxious, he knows that women like this, although their movements and emotions are sometimes more aggressive than men. It is always hoped that men can put them in front of their own desires - this is very effective, Jane's body is relaxed, and the chair is narrow. Not tolerate two people, she sat on Douglas as she did last time, and Douglas raised her body and kissed her lips. Her pointed chin, then the chest and abdomen, today does not use perfume, she only has the smell of water vapor and hair, her skin is very soft, hot like a hidden warmer inside the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her waist was held by Douglas. Jane always pays attention to her body. Her waist is only eighteen inches. She is like a female student. Douglas never touches the female student who is studying. It was a tempting temptation, but it was too easy to cause a scandal. They often come to him after graduation - at that time he rarely refused. He has a house in the town of Grande that is also full of exotic flowers and grasses. There are two front and back doors, where they meet and he will bring tea. They bring cakes and chocolates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you thinking about?" Jane whispered, his lips pressed against his ears. It’s like complaining and it’s like it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I miss you, dear," Douglas said. "No one other than you can make me miss."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your lips are red like coral, your skin is white like lily, your hair is black like fir tree (Note 1)." Jane said: "Your lies are as sweet as honey."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas smiled and made a sly gesture. After removing his finger, he gave Jane a passionate and calm kiss: "Taste time, Jane, we have to be happy." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they don't talk anymore, only the subtle gasps and suppressed shouts are heard in the extraction room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The breeze blew them, taking away the heat brought by **, its effect is huge, so when it disappears, the contrast is quite clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas smelled perfume, musk and ambergris, mint and borneol, and he did not accidentally see Marcia - in his position, and Can't see her full picture, but the square chin is enough to prove the identity of the owner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jane quickly pulled the blanket over the place where she was connected to Douglas, the blanket was not big enough, and her entire upper body was exposed, she was a little surprised I felt a little embarrassed, and immediately stopped in anger, but she finally resisted, "Masia," she should pay attention to her tongue when she speaks, lest she should touch the biting teeth: "I thought... you should know This is my own." Douglas sometimes goes to the town, sometimes to the swimming pool, and Jane has never bothered her at those times. Marcia has never been to the extraction room before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Masia looked at them with both hands hanging like a living nightmare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas’s heart flashed a chill, and he reached out and pushed Jane on him, but before that, Miss Marcia had already whipped up a sturdy thick glass round belly bottle filled with today’s extract. The residual water left after the essence, which can be used to blend the flower dew, about five pounds. This weight is nothing to Marcia - the bottle has a long neck, she grabs it, like a blacksmith clutching his hoe, she waved it skillfully, the bottle licked Jane's forehead, Jane screamed, and it was the second, "Help, save lives." Jane shouted weakly. Third, she fell down, her eyes widened in horror, and her mouth was bleeding, and the white blanket was in the blink of an eye. Absorbed the blood she shed, the blood stained the blanket, and the piece was next to it, like a rose that suddenly grew out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas grabbed her and blocked the fourth of Marcia, Jane’s neck gave a crisp click, and Miss Marcia waved the bottle for the fifth time. Douglas was embarrassed to avoid, his lower body was nothing to wear, but his upper body was neat, shirts and ties were not missing, and a white medical gown was placed on the outside. The bottle was knocked on the wall, broken, and the fragrance was too It was so thick that it smelled like a stench and filled the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Masia!" Douglas shouted. He had already got rid of the horror. He observed Marcia and found her pupil enlarged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Masia flew over, the broken bottle mouth was like a bundle of daggers, Douglas rolled over her feet, his arms were drawn hurt. Blood turbulent, he slammed into the wall, struggling to stand up, Marcia hit from behind and pressed him under his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let me go, Marcia!" Douglas ordered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, Marcia, who was more obedient than Jane, did not move. She looked at Douglas, cried, and still pinched the broken bottle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas tried to take a breath, which is not easy. Marcia sits on his chest, "Masia," he gently called her name. "Why... you have always been the most embarrassing... What happened?" He tried to move his hand, his right arm was hurt, his left hand was still moving, he bent his fingers, and 搔搔Masia was exposed to the outside skin. Before today, every time he did this, he could cause a tremor of Marcia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Masia really shakes, "Douglas."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am... sad." Marcia sobbed and said, "I think... life... no hope." She desperately Said: "You... don't love me at all... you won't marry me..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Masia..."<br /><br / > & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "even if I have done so much for you - herbal tea, as well as ...... Boa, I have done so much, so good ...... I ...... close to him as you desire. Ask him what he likes... guide him... pretend... don't know... his mind," her mouth was in a line, flowing down the corner of her mouth. Mixed with the snot, "...no, sorry... I didn't do it well...he, no longer love me." Her cry began to get bigger: "I know... I'm useless... ...Douglas, you won't see me again... everything. It's all gone... no, Douglas."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I love you." She sniffed her nose "Douglas, I can't live without you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be afraid," she said. "I know what to do, just a moment, no pain." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's really apologetic," Douglas said coldly: "I can't satisfy you with this wish."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expression of Marcia's joy has solidified. She silently fell down, quieter than Jane. She was still breathing, but Douglas knew she survive. The seeds hidden in her body have sprouted, and her spine and internal organs have been smashed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The question is, how can this messy scene be cleaned up? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, who is it - right, Boa...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas push Marcia open, take a look at the arm, blood flow velocity is slowing quickly, he raised his eyes, surrounded by a mess, whether he is among the lucky extraction and odor problems because of the heat away from the school and classrooms? And more than nine, teachers and students have basic sleeping, was rushed here Marcia cries and cries alerted the security guard on duty and teachers also need a little time ...... he had to speed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vine climbed in from the window and found his pants and other clothing in a few seconds, more branches growing from Marcia’s body, they supporting her body, moving slowly to the door, at first glance like Marcia grow up a lot of bars spindly legs, which look both ridiculous and frightening sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
