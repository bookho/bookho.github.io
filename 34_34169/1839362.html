			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two hundred and seventy-nine chapters have been added to 3,800 words, please do not read the adults who are not watching...<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black kitten in white gloves is called. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They wrap around the foot of Anthony Hopkins, squatting on his lap, the cat-colored cat mother followed the kitten and Huo Behind Pukes, sniffing the hot, rich aroma of the air, the screams are slow and gentle, and the tail is standing tall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feeding point of the main cat and dog is fixed by the committee in a shallow lawn on the Rio Grande River. After the lawn is the wooden path often used by the students. After the trail It is a continuous bush and eucalyptus forest, that is, Sasha and Besib found a family of five living in the abandoned bird's nest - the school does not allow students or teachers to hold plastic bags or newspapers, but other times Sex products contain food, each person needs to prepare their own utensils, cats and dogs have the remaining bones and residues, the feeders need to clean up themselves, and the feeding time is also prescribed, every day from three to five in the afternoon point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cats have already enjoyed their daily meal, filled with dark brown granules of solid cat food and cat biscuits. The material and size are all varied, ceramic, stainless steel, resin, and two glass ashtrays, which contain lighter, finer-grained kittens and cat food. It seems that some people have noticed the new addition here. Cats - The head of a strong Mumbai cat is buried inside and eaten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When smelling instead of hearing, and seeing Anthony Hopkins coming, it raised his head proudly and made a manly temperament A scream of screaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cows and cats walked gracefully, and they wiped their faces and neck intimately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Mumbai cat should be the father of these kittens. The kitten inherits his dark, bright fur and only lacks on the four small claws. In addition, only one kitten inherited the round face of the cow cat, the other three are the "Indian Leopard face" unique to the Mumbai cat, and all the kitten's eyes are the same copper color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The food brought by Hopkins exudes a humanity also has a coveted aroma, and the cats that are eating are slightly turbulent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Today is a stewed blue squid,” Anthony Hopkins introduced to the cow cat and its children: “There are small squid fish.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small The cats were even more anxious, the cat mother picked up the golden-green eyes, and Hopkins placed his own feeding device on the ground, rotating the top of the button, and the utensils were rotating like the morning glory at dawn. Lightly opened to form a spiral frame, the doctor removed the stainless steel plate from the shelf, and the stewed blue squid and small squid fish in the plate still had the temperature - the squid and the small squid came from the Grand River, very fresh The processing location is the kitchen of the teacher's dormitory. Hopkins separated a part, added a little salt, and gave it to Mr. Neek, who was next door, and the "rising" that once broke the antique crystal cup. Oh, no, Mr. Hufu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plates have not stabilized, the kittens immediately rushed up, there are two plates with blue squid, but the four kittens are crowded. Kneeling on a plate, Hopkins picked up the kitten that had inherited the flat face. It didn't understand why he was eating and hanging in the air, and was smeared with the soup. Mao, screaming, and when the doctor placed it on the second plate, it looked around and screamed at the beard - until his mother came over and sniffed I sniffed, and I ate it quickly—it hurried to keep up, so I picked up the milky white fish soup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mumbai cat tasted the stewed fish, this does not seem to fit its appetite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A yellow-yellow curled cat looks like inadvertently around the back of Anthony Hopkins, sticking a head out of his elbow Observed humans, Mumbai cats, cow cats and their children, mainly the Mumbai cat who has one and a half times his body length - it is concentrating on small cod fish, three kittens Around a plate, the cow cat and a kitten occupy the second plate, and the middle space can completely hold down a fat cat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, the yellow-yellow curled fat cat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s just an ordinary person, he probably won’t understand what’s going on in this second, except for a weird “hey!” Anthony Hopkins saw it very clearly. Just as the sallow-haired cat was only a few inches away from the white-skinned stewed squid, it was like an unnoticed Mumbai cat slamming and pulling out his claws. The unlucky one who wanted to take the opportunity to steal the delicious food was smoked and almost fell into the river. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
