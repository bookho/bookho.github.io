They are strong, but like any building, windows and doors are the parts that are most easily consumed by time. He slammed the stone and finally had a small black piece of stone that was smashed by him. The survivor of the stranger Jared had lowered his head and put the stone in front of him. He found three-quarters of it. The holy symbol - jhs, the middle cross, jhs is the first letter of the Latin word "Jesus. Human. Savior" - he raised his toes and went to see the other stones on the slope of the window. He found The overlapping xp symbolizes Christ, a and Ω, the first and last of the Greek letters, indicating that God is the root and destination of all things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are simple lines, lambs and pigeons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Every room is like this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Every one." Old monk said "Every new brother can live with someone, or live in a vacant room after the departure of the predecessors, but they will always build a new house for themselves and the Lord."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hyman remembered the simple, cave-like church, which was built with tens of millions of stones, and it seems to have been separated from human society for a thousand years. On the island, this can be regarded as a miracle. If these stones are on, he said that each piece is engraved with the symbols, words and portraits he just saw, then...<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new brothers of the Monastery of the Bolu Island are free to move around. In the months after the resurrection of Jesus, it is a rare stage of the life of the island of Bolu, full of sunshine, only in the morning and evening. It’s raining, Hayman. Stronga has traveled through every room—in other monasteries, the monks’ doors are not allowed to be locked. The monks here are even more so, and their homes have no doors at all. There was only one long strip of holes, and whenever they welcomed other brothers, Heyman was surprised to find out. The monks who lived here are not the lunatics and jailers in his imagination. On the contrary, they are knowledgeable, open-minded and talkative. When Heyman asks about the rules and regulations of the monastery in Bolu Island, they happily pat him. The shoulders tell him that the Lord never minds this little thing, and that the island of Bolu has never had a dean and supervised the priest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then if there is a monk who can't stand the loneliness and hardship, and violates his promise. What should I do if I want to escape?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talk to him The monk glared at his bright eyes from the unkempt hair and beard: "How do you need to use the word escape?" He asked with sincerity and confusion: "We came to this island because of the Lord. Tell us, go to the island of Bolu, if there is such a day. A voice tells one of us that leaving the house of Bolu, that is, the Lord has other tasks to give to you, he is Compliance - no one else wants to block him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you know that it is not the voice of the devil?" Hayman did not answer well. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have to believe that the voice that will pass to your ears will be the voice of the Lord." The monk replied happily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, can I leave the Poi family?" Heyman said: "I am not afraid of hardship, but my position is not here." - I was sent here by my brother. I have never heard the Lord ask me to come to the island of Bolu."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"唔..." Nodded: "At the house of Polu. No one will stop another person from coming, or leave. Well, if the Lord really said this to you, of course you can leave, you only have to wait for two years... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two years?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have a boat here, once every three years. Welcome Send pilgrims, you can follow the pilgrims."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hyman squinted tightly, and he felt that he was being mocked and deceived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Supply ship?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No supply ship, Hayman brothers," said the monk "We drink salt ourselves. Planting wheat, beans, raising goats, fishing, oysters, the Lord gave us everything, and every three years, pilgrims bring oil and linen - we don't need more things "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said before Heyman turned away: "Really, you may not have heard the Lord's call, but it is very likely that it is yours." The brothers answered and executed this purpose."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hyman’s legs were restored as early as half a month later, as a messenger and loved by God, no matter how serious, he The injury has never been so long, he once dug his own eye to the saint Jared, and refused the treatment of the mortal, but that night, he grew a new eye - But since he arrived at the Polu family, his abilities were ruthlessly deprived. He could no longer control other people's thoughts, bodies, and even his life. He left him to sleep day and night, and he recited prayers over and over again—his precious body, The body that was taken care of by the Lord and became different from ordinary people became bulky and dirty, dirty and rancid. When he fell from the steep cliff of the jumping goat, he watched his leg bones pierce the muscles and skin, and Bai Sensen’s exposure. When he was outside, he was still ignorant, the monks carried him back to the house, fixed his legs with fish bones and hay, and Heyman. Stronge was still thinking about tomorrow - the next day The third day, the fourth day... his legs did not improve, he doubted It was the curse of the monks who had the devil's curse. They were wiped out in the middle of the night, but his legs were hot, swollen, and pus out. He passed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monks didn’t seem to care about what young Strange was thinking about, they always changed Heyman’s dress, bandaged, and Legs read a variety of prayers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Healing Heyman traveled across the island after completing the assignments assigned to him, and there were about thirty-three domes on the island, he found them The builders are not all one sect. In addition to the three monks who first went to the island of Bolu, there are about fifty monks who spent their half-life or life on the island of Pluj. They have The Jesuits also have retro ceremonies, there are many more and more, there are also Benedictines, and two belong to the Franciscans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the supervision sect, Hayman. Stronga went to ask the old monk, he found himself a piece of open space, piled up on it and roughly polished. Black stone, with the dark yellow ochre gravel on it, the main symbol, his waiter, the sect and the saint Jared's symbol and a brief prayer statement - since he has been banished here, can not be in two Within a year of leaving the island wrapped in the sea, then at least he can still play for his beliefs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His time is scarce, there is no electricity on the island, no candles, shrubs and weeds can only provide smoky smoke, the monks of the Polu family are in accordance with the original canon To pray, nine times a day, from 2:30 in the morning to before going to sleep. In the intercession of prayer, they work, the only barren land on the island that can grow wheat is located on the inner side of the island, far from the source of the only fresh water. The monks are pouring water once a day, and the water is backed by a bucket of barrels. The rope on the barrel rubbed against Heyman’s shoulders, like two slender soldering irons. When the sun was shining, if he could give him a chance to put down his bucket, he might drink a light wood. All the water in the bucket - the monks also have only half a bucket of water per person per day. Of course, if you love to be clean, you can also jump into the sea to take a bath. This is a lot, you don't have to be polite; they sprinkle the droppings of goats and seabirds on the ground, and the ratio of harvested wheat to seeds is about eight to one, even if Heyman couldn't read the book at the school outside. He also knew that it was probably a little better than the fields that the serfs of the seventh century were working on. The wheat that was collected was dried, the shells were crushed, and the stone was crushed. Cooked into a paste, or directly placed in the fire to burn, thrown into the mouth and chew, the monks have their own hobbies and methods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
