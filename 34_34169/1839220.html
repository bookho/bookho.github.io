			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light in the extraction room is bright, Dr. Douglas puts it behind him, his ability is working again, the bushes are mad, blocking the front of the chasers - He didn't think that he would turn back and drive the plants to kill everyone present, including his nephew, and when the witness's ears, eyes, and mouth lost their utility, it didn't matter what he wanted to say. No... He may be able to find a female student and try to get a proof of absence. This may make him lose his professional qualifications. It doesn't matter. He has doctors and pharmacists to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's more, he may be able to go further as he originally thought - replacing his brother as a parent of the Douglas family - he knows that there is a family Many people are disappointed with his repeated failures. Among them, Dr. Douglas's merits are indispensable, but who makes him a stupid brother? He will only rush rampage, scream loudly, not be good at brains, and never bother with his brains - this big scandal that wraps his son in it will make him scream, especially now, the Carson family is watching. Looking for every small crack that can blow your mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brown bear-like man can only compare himself to his age, Dr. Douglas thinks, yes, as the age grows, the vision is broad, With the strengthening of his abilities, his unwillingness and ambition grew like crazy molds in the rainy days, and filled his whole thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's more, he still has a son who is blue and better than blue in stupidity and innocence. When he finds that Boa sees Marcia's eyes wrong, Douglas almost To laugh out, a woman who is almost indistinguishable from a man? With ulterior motives and dark curiosity, he approached Marcia, the poor woman, whose mind was completely disproportionate to her body, and she was more likely to be hooked than the ninth-grade girls in their teens. After he took possession of her, she was more versatile, let her do what she did - he asked her to provide the tea club with special ingredients to the whole swimming club, she added; he let her and Boa She played with some ridiculous tricks, and she tried to ridicule her ridiculous tricks. Although she did not do well, he said in her heart that if she was killed, she would certainly kill. As long as it is for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking about this, Dr. Douglas is deeply upset. He should be more careful, and the guy with a rib is a good tool. But when she is in the hands of others, she is more annoying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few times, he almost stopped and turned around, but there was a feeling that he couldn’t understand, pulling his nerves, he remembered The words of the mentor - the abilities are gifts that God has given to mankind. In addition to their abilities, their bodies are more agile, stronger, more energetic, and more capable than others. This is also evidenced by the fact that every movement during the run pulls the wound on his arm. It hasn't changed more seriously. To be exact, it is healing tenaciously - precisely because of this. He is willing to listen to the warnings in the body like wild animals: "Where is it dangerous, don't go back!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine touched the bushes, the plants were cold and silent, she changed to touch the ground, the soil and the stones mixed in it gave her more More information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here," she said. Pointed out the direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doctor Douglas walked into the river. The dark green algae formed a soft nest and held him up. He drifted down the tributaries of the Grand River, much faster than he walked on the shore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The water is crowded with him, shaking this pale, beautiful man up and down, he blocked his eyes with the arm that was not injured, blood loss Too much makes him a little dizzy - he estimates in his heart how long it will take to reach his destination, a small house on the banks of the Grand River - their mentor asks them to prepare for such a room, Before today, Dr. Douglas also thought it was unnecessary and ridiculous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is money in the cottage, first aid, dry clothes, real passport and proof of identity (Douglas used the summer vacation to go out and find something with himself A single man of five or six points, after getting rid of him, got these). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he noticed something was approaching, it was already late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brown, creeping, like a water snake wrapped around his ankle... something is like opening a hole in mocking him. I ate the piece of algae that was closest to him. They had a lot of licking, like a child, and they ate it. They ate a little bit of the algae nest that he used to shelter. The river poured in, and Douglas couldn’t catch it. Next, turned over and fell into the river. He grabbed one of them, but felt a burning tingling. He threw it away and was horrified to find that his skin was burned by the liquid it secreted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More little tentacles come up, they stare at him, the power is surprisingly great, and when Douglas still wants to struggle, a few pierced him In the wound, Dr. Douglas clearly saw a slap on the brown smooth skin, and the cockroach quickly slid down, his wounds became pale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A round stone hidden in the daffodil flower collapsed him. He fell into the green leaves and overwhelmed the flowers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wound can heal faster, and the lost blood is not made so fast. Douglas squats in front of two children and can't move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's really disgusting." Besib said: "His blood has a stinky smell."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pure psychological effect." Sasha said indifferently: "The blood of the abilities is different from the ordinary people, but the smell and taste are no different, the meat is the same, and the bones are not bad." - Well, take your hands and feet back, Besib, we have decided, just to make sure that he will not escape - we have to stay here for another two or three years."<br /><br />&nbsp Dr. Douglas tried to open his eyes. He saw that the brown tentacles were retreating from his body, slipping back like a sucked noodle, and they indented the shirt and the trousers. In the middle, they are close together, leaving five at the end, twisting, and the nails are growing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't have to come in person at all." He heard that the appearance can be comparable to Boa, but the means and thoughts are more mature than he does not know. The boy who said double said: "Beep and his gun can do it too."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I admit that I was impulsive," Besib said: But I think I have to personally say to him," he turned to Dr. Douglas: "Thank you for your beer, and the two jars of amphetamine and..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He couldn't finish it, and Sasha Hopkins, who had been standing beside him, suddenly caught him and pulled him down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside the back of the face, fell on Hopkins, the deep olive iris reflected a burning white light, he slammed his eyes, backhand When he lived in Sasha, he heard a loud "squeaky" sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dozens of turbulent currents hit the air from midair, and Douglas made a miserable scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reaction between Sasha and Besib is fast enough, but they are still hit, and the current is sucked on them by wet soil and flowers. The top piece is burnt black. The pain made them black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, little bastard," said a sly, sticky voice: "We met again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;A young man came out from behind the Chinese weeping willow. After a few years, his taste was even worse. Two left and right thighs were printed on his shirt. The "place" was half-baked, facing the two. Boys. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He rubbed his fingers, the current creaked and illuminate his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You really let me think about it day and night." Martin said: "Hopkins..." He said: "The devil testified... Dear When I went to bed with a woman, I was thinking about how to be happy with you..." He raised his hand and the electric light revolved around the yellow fingers, gradually forming a frisbee-like thing. "This is a new thing. It can put the thighs or arms, neck, buttocks, or whatever just two things in a nutshell - high heat will burn your blood vessels, your blood will not flow too much, your blood supply will be sufficient, you can clearly understand Feel every pain - it gets a lot of praise, how, try it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha Hopkins doesn't say a word, There was no fear on his face. He reached up and held his stomach, and the internal organs were cramping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishb clenched his other hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone in the room suddenly felt the air became heavy, and the invisible pressure made them even more difficult to breathe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caceline arrived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her ability is enhanced, Sasha thinks, without touching, her emotions can affect other people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin showed a weird expression: "It’s a pity," he said quietly. "I can't... I can't afford her now." Say, put your arm down - he looks like he wants to give up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha was staring at the radiant electric disc from start to finish - he was not surprised when it exploded without warning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He heard Catherine screaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A small thunderstorm struck the ground, the soil was turned over, the stone shattered, the daffodils were lit, the smoke rose, and the sky was full of plants burning The pungent smell that comes with it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
