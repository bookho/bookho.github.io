			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, oh yeah. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Andreana sat in the rocking chair, it swayed slowly and weakly, and the dark brown wood shone with people and pigs. Grease, also sheep and fish, from the last hoe it was knocked on - it is often smeared with oil, it is placed in the kitchen, in the hallway, in the bedroom, in the courtyard, old Andreas goes Wherever I moved it, it firmly fulfilled its obligations, but it can only be like this. It can only be like this. It’s too old, too old, it can’t be shaken like it was half a century ago. It’s light and quiet, too old, and Old Andriana’s age is bigger than it’s. It’s her wedding, her fiance, a lean and dark sea god island boy who only saw her three times before marriage. This is already a bit too much, but who makes Andriana the smallest and most favored daughter, the first time she got a silk headscarf, red is like her lips, the second time is this The chair is olive wood, the boy made it by himself, and the third time was a gold ring. The young man is coming to say goodbye. He is going to work on the western continent. Together with her brother, he promises to bring a set of gold jewelry, earrings, bracelets, necklaces, and perhaps gems and diamonds to his future wife. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He left, never came back, because someone attacked the car they used to smuggle olive oil, the car turned over and caught fire, Andriana’s The brother was killed, the boy was crushed, no one could help him climb out, and one of his friends gave him a shot so that he could not be burned to death, so they could not bring back his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They built a hollow tomb on Poseidon Island, with his full set of underwear and the red silk scarf. Driana tasted the bitter fruit of a special product on Poseidon Island earlier than many women on the island of Poseidon. She wore that gold ring on her hand. Sitting in the chair and learning crochet, all day long, she no longer accepts the woo of the young man, and instead dedicate her energy and life to the "Tang" at that time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, Chegal was still a wild boy with bare bottoms, and it is no different from Besib now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She hooked it, weaved it. She doesn't know how much she has weaved. She has everything, peony cushions, hexagonal headscarves and shawls. Tea coasters, small bags and large bags, slippers, sofa towels. Seat cushions, carpets. Toys... There are all sorts of things you can't imagine, wearing beads, mixed with silk and ribbons, and colorful. The small one can be hidden in the palm of the hand, the big one can cover a whole car, she weaves herself. Also woven for others, "Tang". His sons, Chegaler, Meyare, Besib, Pepi, Bep, Amp, Priest, Hopkins... Her speed is so Fast, holding the crochet is less than half of the other women's, but weaving them twice as much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is going to sew a hat of seaweed green to Besib, the pagoda pattern, she doesn't know how much he will still have, but at least, she also keeps his clothes, this hat can be placed in the most of the clothes. Above. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are quiet places in the corridor, whether it’s the Poseidon Island or the people that Chegarer has found elsewhere, have been controlled or deceived, those It is possible that the young people of Besib and Pepi were sent to the Western Continent, and Hopkins and his sons were also on the Western Continent, and she only needed a short night to wait until the dark sky re-lighted. Things are a foregone conclusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Celegal will have children. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be children. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A healthy, an orthodox mother who swore to God, a boy born to a girl from Poseidon Island, is better than Besib. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wrapped the green velvet on the crochet and began to pray for Besib. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha stopped the action, just in the moment, he almost Was discovered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the movie, the dreamer is doing his own work in a dream, but in reality, Dr. Hopkins prefers to be awake when someone is awake Entering his mind--"Thoughts are not limited by time and space. How fast and how strong it can be. I don't know. It can only be measured by nerve reflexes, so when the intruder falls asleep, it is more than awake. Danger, because he is in the 'home', it is easy to find out what is wrong; but it is not necessarily awake, because his attention will be attracted by other things, his consciousness is floating in the world's most At the top, it's more important than the boring parade to monitor (remember the past or think about the future), such as games, * or a lot of food. At that time, the busy consciousness will not notice the inner and inner The situation of the layer - unless there is anything to remind it (a wedding anniversary, or an exam), the consciousness will panic back to here and look through the memory.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha pick Although the timing of the election was rushed but very suitable, weaving was not a job suitable for distraction. Old Andriana had to concentrate on not hooking her fingers, but when she thought of Besib, she unconsciously touched the past. The memory, the mother of Besib, the main consciousness is swaying in the distance not far from Sasha. When she pulls up the image, the image is surrounded by countless memory debris and their fluctuations. Almost passed through the young intruder.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A piece of dregs slowly fell in front of Sasha, it was a transcript, rolled up, the score above is very beautiful, belongs to... Hopkins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boy was a little surprised because the image of the transcript was very detailed, the teacher’s crooked signature, the handwritten red score, the texture of the paper, the tiny creases, 啪The sly sound and the soft touch make it look like a real thing - fourth grade. Then he noticed that in those countless memories, there are also things that belong to him, there are many, including small biscuits with peppers - Sasha thinks that in the old Andriana's cognition, he It is just one of the annexes of Besib, and many people on Poseidon think so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he exists alone in the world of Old Andriana. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha left the transcript in the same place, now is not hesitating and moving - he walks along the memory, they are like the roadside The wildflowers guide him the way, guiding him to the deepest, and also the place to store the most sincere emotions and ideals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more you walk, the thicker the white "powder" and the sharper the outline of the components, they are not dense fog or gel The things, they are one by one that are so slender that they can't be seen with the naked eye, they can only touch the lines with the feeling, they are entangled, coiled together, wrapped in each other, the memory of old Andriana is like Embellished beads on the line, large and small, colorful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the most important thing? Own, Besib, of course this is impossible, then what about Chegal? Old Andreana sees him as if he is looking at his younger brother, but the deeper he goes, the less memory Chelal has. No, the exact point is that the memory that Sasha Hopkins recognizes is more Less, strange tools, strange letters, strange photos - a handsome young man, dark skin, looking at the camera playfully, then, another photo, family, father, mother, grandmother, grandfather, brother, also There is a girl, that is Andrea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you go further? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thread is wrapped around the sand, the calves, the knees, the thighs, the waist, the arms, the chest, the neck, he feels suffocated, and the pressure comes from every part of the world. He was wrapped up, but he knew he was not far from the destination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let me see," he whispered to the unknown presence: "Just look."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The power made a scornful sneer, but it obeyed the command, the silvery, subtle particles diffuse and spread, the silk couldn't catch the sand, and he closed his eyes—he didn't need to really look at it with his eyes, just as before Said, here is four-dimensional. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He found it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, oh yeah. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rocking chair is ringing, it has been used for so many years, it can be seen to continue to use it, just like the old Andriana, she fed two "Tang", the heir of "Tang", and the heir of "Tang". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Celegal survived, became young and healthy, and he married a sea god island girl whose father and his brother were family members, and gave birth to three A son, the eldest son inherited his career, and the second son completed the unfinished school of Besib, became a clear and white good man, he became a member of parliament, became the governor, later became the president, and the three sons Entering the army, he will become a general. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Celegal’s eldest son has fulfilled the expectations of the Poseidon Island people for nearly a hundred years, and the children of Poseidon Island can no longer be accompanied by firearms and knives, they become Innocent and slow, like the children of the Western continent, pure is similar to cruelty - including his children, he has been married for a long time, the biggest boy is going to school in the Western continent, and the youngest child is still learning to walk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She checked her own pile of baskets, with green algae in the basket, mixed with silver thread, what did she want to weave? a hat? Who is it for? To the little bastard who always digs into his kitchen to steal pies and grapes? Who is that? Is it the first few children? The third or the fourth? Or the eldest son before the eldest son? He is always dark, naked, with a demon name, looking into his eyes full of love and trust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun shines through the window at the end of the corridor, faint, but warm, warm and she wants to take a nap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why don’t you sleep, everything is so good, so perfect, her mission on earth has been completed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that hat, she hasn’t finished the hat yet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
