This shows that the temperature and humidity here are maintained at a fairly comfortable level. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A warm and safe nest, huh? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like Catherine, Martin looked at the room very carefully, and every detail was not missed, but unlike the former, he was more Estimating the value of these items, he is different from the woman who was born in an orphanage and grew up in a slum. When he was still young, his family was still the so-called "middle and upper class" and they lived in In a community on the edge of Cleveland, there are gardens and garages, with lots of empty houses for those who come to visit from time to time, and a domestic servant and gardener. His mother also likes all kinds. The "fixed product" (a word that has almost the same meaning as luxury goods), she once tirelessly educated her children how to identify those things, colors, textures, packaging, fine work and shoddy, and relish their prices with gusto . Therefore, although Martin does not understand anything else, he knows at least that those fabrics that are soft and lustrous and fluffy are like a cloud of bedding that belongs to the kind of things that cost a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The child slept very hard, his arm sticking out from under the furry blanket, his fingers curled up, motionless, but suddenly he made a small Cough (this Martin is seen from his expression and the vibration under the blanket), the monitoring room moved up, the doctor who was looking at the medical case or other documents there turned to the monitor's display, another doctor And the nurse walked out like a cat lightly and swiftly. They walked over to the child's bed and carefully checked his condition. During this time, the child coughed again, but it was not severe. The nurse got it under the doctor's instructions. A cup with a straw, she picked up the child and carefully let him take a few mouthfuls of water that didn't know if he had added the drug without forcibly awakening him. These few mouthfuls of water played a very good role. Even if the child didn't even open his eyes, he got rid of the distress caused by the cough and returned to a happy sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn’t deserve to be treated so well, a criminal child, or a small criminal, Martin hates to think that he should be like those damn hybrids, Even if it is not sent to prison, it should be thrown into the juvenile correctional hospital. It is a cheap and ruined public hospital. Martin, the hospital, went after his father’s unfortunate bankruptcy. It is full of disinfectant syrup, white dazzling light, plastic seat. Chairs, metal beds, crowded wards and waiting rooms, business offices, doctors and nurses who don't want to work harder, take a hard injection and gavage... these are the little bastards deserved. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it wasn’t the two instructions he made at the end, Martin’s nearly 10,000 volts of lightning that he had to drive his body should be able to pass the rope. Extending into the interior of the helicopter, as he was "educated" during a short trip to Ariau, the current flowing around would destroy the equipment and structure inside the helicopter and could even directly cause the fuel tank to explode - in that case, even if The body and ability are far superior to those of ordinary people. Even if you don't die on the spot, you will be seriously injured. He can avenge his brother Jack who died in the hands of this hybrid. He can also get tens of millions of rewards and good reputation. Or you can write a book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now it's all over, he has forever lost his brother, the body and the body are scarred, but only the institution's free medical treatment (Tian know what this can be considered compensation!) and the district 100,000 yuan reward (this is still very big Some have a "pension" nature). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This little devil can get such a luxurious and perfect treatment and meticulous care! More than once, Martin regretted that he had not tested the body of a monkey that had been roasted into coke by a strong current because of the pain and disappointment after the event. He thought that the child would be burnt with the monkey... he had a chance to This broke his plan and the future, and the little liar of countless hells lived alive! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this is also good, Martin pulled himself away from the glass, he thought gloomyly, as long as this small animal is still screaming, not afraid The big beast will not find it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The edge of the wilderness, there are several motels near the intersection of the interstate highway. Their facilities are very simple, the food is basically only beer, cigarettes, hamburgers and hot dogs, even the sandwiches are not prepared for the preparations, the gadgets are too delicate for the drivers, the room has a shower, a bed, a TV that plays adult programs. The machine and a dozen condoms, sheets and quilt cover are changed every day, but the mattress and the tire are still a few years of thunder, there are free shower gel and shampoo, but it smells like pet supplies, no hair dryer and Rechargeable batteries, no wired network or international long distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it’s hard to think of Mr. Anthony Hopkins here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has been here for three days, unlike the last time, he soon found it easy to find Sasha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Mr. Anthony Hopkins has sneaked into hospitals more than once: You see, he is familiar with the typical pattern of the hospital, familiar with all kinds of written and not in the hospital. Written rules and unspoken rules can also mimic any pharmacist, anesthesiologist, intern, male nurse or attending doctor in the patrol room, and get what he needs from these – controlled drugs and anesthetics, surgery Tools, instruments (such as cranio saws) and other things that are not easily purchased from the store or online, but this medical institution is different, it is closed, isolated, inaccessible, not ordinary people, even It is basically a "hunter" settlement center with small and narrow access, and in addition to the natural barrier and the artificially strict access control, they are very familiar with each other, everyone is very vigilant. An unfamiliar face immediately attracts everyone's attention and rude behavior (Doctor Hopkins vs. this kind of African-like bee-like hysteria I don’t appreciate it in the bottom.) <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat at the window, pondered for a while in the abundant sunshine, installed telescopes and eavesdropping equipment, and shirts that he hung on the shower curtain poles ( He doesn't trust the hotel's laundry workers. And, with his own toothbrush and mouthwash, towels, he carefully and thoroughly picks up the entire room, leaving no fingerprints or hair is almost impossible, but He knew that someone would soon rent this room and mess everything up here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doctor Hopkins went downstairs to checkout, of course, the name of the ID card has changed, his face is also, this time he did not carry out medical Modification, just padding a little cotton between the mandible and the gang, making his cheeks round, and using the kind of silicone that the film makeup artist used, so that his nose is not so narrow and pointed, he Pulled the eyebrows and used the non-marking powder to increase the distance between the eyes and the eyebrows. Finally, dye the hair brown and use the chemical potion to heat it into a similar natural roll style, put on a set of ordinary shirts and suits, put all Putting things in a big box with wheels and a backpack on the back - now he looks very young and very ordinary, and almost every car spares salesman who stays at the motel for a while is almost like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He drove the car away from the hotel. At night, Dr. Hopkins had already arrived in another city. He changed his clothes and walked into a communications equipment store to buy a mobile phone that was mainly for children. It was very small and functional. Simple, then bought a mobile phone card on another vending machine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doctor wrote down the number. He wrapped the fully-charged cell phone and cell phone card into a cookie box and then entrusted them with a sweet preservative to a medium-sized courier company. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The anesthesiologist" has been in the "Frozen" state, this is the way the organization has always dealt with. After all, among the six people who went there, only he and Martin survived, but because Martin’s brother Jack was killed by the goal, he was not renewed for a long time. Enabled, and there is no way to prove that his innocent "anaesthetist" had to wait for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's more, he understands that he is not so innocent - he was the first to be found by the "Ghoul", the possibilities he imagined, the changes The tricks and conspiracy did not happen or played a role. His proud anesthesia was vulnerable to the vulnerability of the guy who used to be a doctor. He was easily laid down by the prey, and he was cut open. The intestines were pulled out and then dropped on his face. He was so scared that he would become the most delicious staple of the guy's dinner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one who wants to "talk", he knows everything, and he has nothing to say; that person wants to meet other people, he does not hesitate to pass the wireless The communication shouted to have the best relationship with him, and it was also the easiest to hook, Bard playing the axe. He was lying on his side, unable to hear, watching, listening to the honest Bud stepping into the trap, lost his ability to move, and the cruel guy took out the spine with a knife. Children, like the chef of a Japanese restaurant, opened a sea otter, and a bloody bone was lifted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He still remembers very clearly how the bones are tumbling under the fire, like a living snake. Its tip hit his face and it hurts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appearance of the captain is really unexpected to everyone. He doesn’t know if the captain knows anything, but this sixth-minded man is obviously suspicious. He didn't chase the "Ghoul" who had hidden into the forest in the moment he appeared. Instead, he went to Bader first. God knows why he still has a tone, then comes over and asks himself - this day's killing ball Didn't he see his intestines still exposed? ! - Last resort, he killed the captain with his own little things hidden under his tongue. He dared to swear to his mother's grave, which he originally wanted to deal with "Ghoul", but who made the vigilant guy Never been so close to him? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is holding the intestines to open the captain’s face, digs out the gadget that will expose himself, and then makes it difficult to make him a change. The victim of the killer should have the appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He swears that at the end of the process, he heard a very light laugh, a very special laugh. If he is allowed to listen again, he will definitely recognize it immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doorbell rang, and the "anaesthetist" dragged his two legs to open the door. He had to avoid the suspicion of the institution as soon as possible to avoid the suspicion. I have not contacted other companions, rarely go out, and almost everything is purchased from the Internet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poppy flower soy flour powder cookie, it is his favorite kind, but unfortunately too expensive, he can only buy a box every few days, can not Eat every day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
