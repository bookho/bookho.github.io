			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hyman walked a few steps with the help of two monks, and he gave him a wide road in awe, except for the crouching on the ground. The girl, his eyes are only gray-purple sky and white mountains, the wind on the mountain is very big, Hayman's black hair and robes are blown straight behind, there is not much rain, some are too big to be blown by the wind. The scattered drops of water hit his face and then flowed down the cheeks, making him look sad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He closed his eyes and took the cross and said, "Derx, chapter 16."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;People followed him loudly, and when they were still the fetus, they began to listen to their mothers who recited the "Minister of the Ages" and "Samuel". In the cradle, the boys and girls responsible for taking care of the babies were in their ears. Bently repeating "Genesis", "Psalm" or "Lamentation", and when they grow up, they can walk around the room, and the private channel broadcasts throughout the day without interruption. The Bible, and the "sage", that is, the speech of Jared Stronger; after a year or two, both boys and girls have to go to school, Jared Stronge continues to be in the horn Speaking to them, it is a few hours, which constantly quotes the sentences in the Bible and even the passages. Girls and boys can hear things differently. Girls learn how to be a good wife, how to obey, how to be patient; and boys get more information – such as the end of the world, the final judgment, etc. They must be prepared to meet the war. They must learn how to use a knife, how to kill a dog, a goat, or even a "pagan." The "sage" is convinced that in his speech, the "devil" of the outside world is always from beginning to end. They are all trying to invade this pure and rich blessed land, and it never stops during the day and night. They must be vigilant, be brave, be cold, be yourself, to others, especially those who cover the human skin, they drive around on the road, knock on every door that is not tight enough, use The evil and sweet language abducts children and women and sacrifices them to the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the end of the day. They also have a test, each child has to completely write out what he heard, otherwise. The priests will use the rattan and the belt to pull the lazy devil out of their bodies, and this behavior must be accompanied by the Bible. Each priest is equipped with a small player that can be placed in a jacket pocket or Don't be on the belt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If the children do not fear the Lord. Although there are many, you should not be happy because of this. Don't rely on their lives, and don't rely on their descendants; because, there are A son who fears God is better than a thousand unrespecting children. It is better to die without a son than to leave a son who is not devout. Because a wise man can make a city densely populated, and the family of sinners, But the city is desolate. I have seen many such things with my own eyes. I have heard more than this. The fire burned in the assembly of sinners, and the anger angered the nationals who believed in it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hayman opened his eyes. In the first one or two seconds, he felt that he couldn't see things. The singing of the monks and nuns came from far away—in a flash, the sound and the scenery were drawn closer. He must be able to see clearly and listen to it any time before. The prayer is over. People also sang hymns under the guidance of Hayman. Men, women, and children tried their best to let go of their voices, lest the performance was not outstanding enough. Their voices shook the entire ceiling, and the hands became fists. Many people close their eyes when the psalms are nearing the end, shaking their bodies and panting desperately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl lying on the floor is singing, her eyes are full of stunned, panic and fear, her voice is sharp and sharp, her hands repeatedly tighten the neckline It seems that I have to hang myself alive. She is almost desperate to pray to God, praying that hymns will never be sung, she is willing to squat forever on the cold and hard slate, sing it, until the end of the day, don't let her face the upcoming things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, no hymn can be sung forever, and today’s one is especially short. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to destroy all sinners in the country every morning, I want to The Lord's city eliminates all evildoers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People breathe in silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If anything can be more urgent than doing good, it will only be the same - that is to punish evil. Because doing good can only benefit one person, several people, and Punishing evil can benefit the public - today, we are going to judge a sinner here, Millian." Heyman lowered his eyes and swept the ground in disgust: "Her's guilty - murdered Jared Stranya Each!" He raised his voice slightly: "Jerder Strang Jacob, our father on the earth! A saint!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't! The girl shouted desperately as she crawled forward and tried to grab his robes or feet. "I didn't, I didn't, I swear to God, it was just an accident!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You pushed him and broke his forehead," Hayman took a step back and said hard: "Who allowed you to do that, who made you do this?! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just want to run away!" the girl trembled and said, "My pajamas are caught in his wheelchair." - I didn't pay attention..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hayman frowned. "What makes you want to run away? Abandon your responsibility and work regardless?" He glanced at the crowd. A middle-aged woman cringed and lowered her head. She was the mother of Millian. Well, although you can't be sinful, I will give you a chance to defend."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because...because the saint wants to...clean the body..." Millie Ann stammered, "But..." She took courage. She even raised her chest, raised her head, and widened her eyes. She had beautiful green eyes and was crystal clear with tears. "He wants me to lick my tongue!... 舔 his... full body!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She spits out the last word, shy and resentful Her body was covered with red tide, blood rushing, and heat was flowing in her face and neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a time, no one made a sound, even the breath was lightened, Millian waited, the rain gradually grew, and the cold water was Just take her body temperature away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why don't you do what he said?" Heyman asked calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is my father! Father!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because he is ours Father, we are the fathers on the ground, so we have to serve him day and night,” Heyman said earnestly, with a bit of heartfelt anger: “This is your glory, your blessing, not everyone is qualified to do this. Close to him. Pay attention to him and soothe him - but it is obvious that you love arsenic more than honey, you love manure more than agarwood, you love numbness more than silk - serving saints is not your wish You are more willing to kneel under the devil's heel and act according to his orders."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hayman Brother!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have no right to speak here! Devil!" Heyman looked at the girl named Millian. When his voice fell, Millian couldn't make a sound, and she panicked and scratched her throat. Pull out a bright trace on the top. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is a change" state! Mad!" a voice said softly, almost in the rain, but Heyman heard, "Who is? Talking?" He raised an arm and pointed in the direction of the sound. The people who were there immediately dispersed: "If you speak evil, you will not be able to act."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A big boy, smaller than Millian, has a thin body. He also wants to act with others and hide himself. But how can you not move, you can only stand straight like a stone statue. The monk around Hayman took him agilely and grabbed him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hayman nodded a little tiredly: "There is no such word in our dictionary, the devil is borrowing his body to speak."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.The big boy and Millian were put together. They can't move, they can't talk, and Stronga is surrounded by a circle, but far away from them, just like the two of them suffer from leprosy. At the same time they are also watching Heyman in awe, and Hayman is not the first to show the ability of angels and saints to give him. But every time they can get them into awkward happiness, can there be more tangible evidence than this? The Lord is in the middle of them, right in this room, on this terrace! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The simple firearms were quickly erected, the men set up charcoal and branches below, and a monk was preparing to pour oil on them, Hayman stopped he. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a flame that cleans any filth and does not require more manpower," Hayman said. "As long as it is evil, it will be burned." The hair is rolled up, the flesh is black, and the bones are crisp."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rain has been so large that people are soaked with firewood, no one left, two sinners are hung in On the shelf, the mother pulled up the headscarf, covered the baby's face, and inserted the finger into his or her mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ignited matches were thrown into the woodpile, they burned miraculously little by little, and the milk-like smog rose and spurred In the eyes of the people, the flames flashed in the dark night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a small fire may not be enough to cook a lamb - but it does not prevent people from seeing what they want to see with satisfaction - although the flame is temporarily They can only touch the bottom of the sinner's feet, but they are already swallowed up by the fire of hell. As Heyman said, their hair is rolled up, the bubbles are swelled, and the skin and muscles have terrible folds. Shrinking, loud and silent mouth spit out the smelly airflow - some sensitive, or more devout, people vowed that they have heard the sound of broken bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hyman only looked at it and turned his head. He still has more follow-up things to deal with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
