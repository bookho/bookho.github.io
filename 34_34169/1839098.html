			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine closed the store door at five o'clock at eight o'clock, began to clean the ground, wipe the wall, the counter and the various jars, she stepped on the stool, Stretching his arms, bending down, kneeling on the floor, hooking his head, trying to polish every piece of wood and glass, the skin on his fingers was white and wrinkled because of too much soaking in the sewage, in the nails The swelled out, the knees were blue and purple, and every bit of pain hurts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clock in the store rang slowly at nine o'clock - suddenly the doorbell rang, Catherine was taken aback, Mrs. Alan said, probably to ten It will only come back around the clock. She thought that the time was still abundant. Now she had to drop the jug and the rag, and hurriedly climbed up and limped to the front door. Even so, the piercing knob The doorbell has already been ringed three times - she lifted the door latch and had not had time to say good night. The two doors with glass and iron bars were knocked open by a savage force. The door was hit directly. Her chest, sweeping her nose, she shed tears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people came in, Catherine was pushed to the wall, licked a few fists, and then was twisted by a pair of hands like a pair of irons, someone was playing Her back of the head pushed her shoulder and forced her to follow the person in front. Her ears creaked, her eyes filled with tears, and she couldn't see anything. She only lifted her feet subconsciously when she touched the steps, so as not to be pulled down by the rough drag - her head was a huge one. Ass, covered in black lace skirt, Catherine feels familiar, because this 20 yuan per inch hand-woven lace is Catherine deliberately purchased directly from Venice "Burano" through the network, and rushed for a few nights Carefully and carefully decorated Mrs. Alan on her beautiful black velvet skirt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was kicked open and made a loud noise, Sasha Lifting his head from the drawing board, he leaned against the corner in a quiet manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boy’s red hair is particularly conspicuous under the light and light bedding, and the shadow cast by Mrs. Alan, who is tall and tall, covers him all over, boy Sleeping unsteadily, the sound of the sound and the drastic changes in the light suddenly made him wake up. He screamed and jumped out of the comfortable bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alan Mrs. Alan rushed over and held her youngest boy in her arms, kissed and stroked, and her mouth was like a flood that opened the gate. That pours the words of grateful Dade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conversely, the people who came with her suddenly quieted down, and they didn’t know when they had let go of Catherine who had been thrown into the room. No one has ever been standing in the same place, and several of them still have no smile on Catherine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can you run away? God testified that all the people in the town are looking for you!" Touching enough, kiss is enough, Alan The wife put on the stance of giving him a slap in the face anytime and anywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I... I have a headache." The little boy hangs his head, his red hair is wet by the sweat that oozes when he is lethargic, sticking to the gray cheek And forehead: "I have a headache... a headache." He turned over and over, as if he had only learned this sentence since birth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha noticed that he was doing his best not to see his mother...and others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sasha?" Mrs. Alan suddenly turned her head back, her tone was gentle, and she could even say that she was kindly shouting another boy’s name: "I want to ......" Her eyes flashed: "He didn't bother you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." Sasha calmly replied: "He seems to be very tired. He climbed in and fell asleep."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Alan stared at him for at least a minute or two. Then she smiled and said: "You are a good boy, Sasha." She said happily: "If my children can listen to you like this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She picked up her little boy and turned around and walked out of the room without forgetting Catherine who was dragged up by people: "Sorry, Catherine," she said. "You have to understand me. As a mother, you know you lost." How worried the child is. What's more, she stunned the last sheriff: "It just happened something - a madman wants the lion to kill us... a murderer." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, it’s not too flat outside," Sergeant Abel pulled his hat and sorted out the badge he hung on his belt: " He still has a lot of helpers. The guards in the town have already been dispatched. Everyone’s emotions are a bit unstable. In order to avoid... danger, you better accept my advice, Catherine,” his fingers moved over the holster. Moved away: "Don't go out," he said, profoundly: "Reassured, these two days will be resolved soon. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Today, you don't have to spend the night, you can accompany Sasha. Mrs. Alan is generously and generously supplemented.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence is like a powerful signal that represents the passing of things, men and women are unscrupulously haha Laughing down the stairs, leaving Catherine and Sasha alone in the attic.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Before Catherine made any noise, Sasha raised a hand and held it over his lips, then he gestured that Catherine closed the door first, then pulled the drawer and pulled a piece of chocolate from it. "Do you want some chocolate? He asked.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine sat down, didn't want to eat chocolate, her nose was still hurting, her chest was boring, upset, no, she There was no appetite, but Sasha kept the chocolate into her mouth with the child's unique stubbornness.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine’s teeth hurt, Sasha's strength is not small, and his movements are not so much feeding, but he is throwing a dagger into the enemy's mouth.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe yourself It was indeed an enemy in his eyes, Catherine thought.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine’s mouth was green, her nose was awkward, very swollen, and the white turtleneck was pulled over her shoulder. Although it has been pulled back now, most of the buttons above have disappeared. From the cracks, Sasha can see Catherine's beautifully shaped ru room and the large pieces of indigo on it. The beautiful blond hair is messy. Knot, the neck is full of sweat, the skirt is full of footprints and sewage, sitting there is like a pile of dirty . Rickety cargo <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp;; & nbsp; & nbsp "chocolate taste it? "Sasha lifted the drawing board and quickly wrote on it: How do you feel? ps: Don't say what you think, I don't know if our words will be heard by others!!!<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...very good, very tasty. Catherine hesitated, took over the drawing board - if she could deceive herself before then, then the intense malice she was exposed to today was enough to overthrow everything she felt in the past - she was on the drawing board. Write: Very bad, what is the matter?!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you beaten by the bad guys? "- Catherine, think about it, why did you choose here?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's a misunderstanding." - I heard from my roommate, a secluded town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Misunderstanding?" - Roommate? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha’s eyes slightly picked up a pick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is... they don't want to do that, so Mrs. Alan and I apologize, aren't they?" - my college roommate, one used to be here A girl who has lived for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, I think I understand." - University roommate? What, I mean, can you still remember her look? Be careful, to be clear and detailed, for example: Do you remember the clothes that she and you used to describe the town? - "You hurt, Catherine?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately. Just a little bit hit." - What to wear? She likes to sleep naked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you want to create a sticker?" - Think about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I think..." Catherine’s head was aching, she bit her teeth and shrugged her shoulders: "I... I don't need it." "She is pale, she doesn't remember, it seems that she has a roommate, and she really likes to sleep naked, but did the girl say that?" Those words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But," Sasha took the artboard: "There is blood flowing out. Need me to help?" - You have been hypnotized. He wrote quickly on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——As I thought, Catherine, even if the "institution" is only a semi-official loose organization, it will not allow those under its jurisdiction to possess specific capabilities. People run around and do whatever they want, let alone some of them become new criminals anytime, anywhere; Catherine, their so-called trackers are just gimmicks, they don’t control anything by anyone who knows A little brain creature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--They have a way to let you go where they want you to go, see, don’t need to be a web-based follow-up survey, and don’t need to stick to the world. Your photos and the amount of the reward, you will run into the cage yourself, stay there and wait for them to find you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-In fact, I think this method is too rough and simple, perhaps because the capabilities you have are not too threatening (may also be Because you are too stupid). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I said no," Catherine snatched the artboard: "I just need to wash." - Then why don't they come to us? ! ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It looks very painful, Catherine." - Have you caught the squid? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——There is a method of fishing for squid called live fish bait. The squid likes fresh fish, mixes them with ash, and puts a small amount into the bait. Put the straw into the bait tube and gently put the cage into the bottom of the pool. The smell of meat will spread out slowly from the bait window. The squid will taste and swim into the bait tube. The guy who puts the bait can eat it beautifully! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——This town is a bait tube, we are small fish... (Sasha squints) You know which two squid they want. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I think I need to wash it well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha heard a loud and rushing sound in the small bathroom attached to the attic, and the cold air was saved in the gap between the doors. He thought that Catherine was probably taking a cold shower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She should be awake to her own mind, she has not been normal since she came here, even if she is eager for crystal shoes, roses, prince ash The girl does not have to be so naive and stupid, at least the guy will not treat her stepmother as a prince in a wishful way, treating abuse as a caress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She only needs a little attention to discover the anomalies in the town - the most obvious point: the money they use and they should have The actual income does not match at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only townspeople who live on olive and spice raw materials and whose annual income should be around 1,000 to 1,500 yuan, although they do not own golf, tennis and yachts. Horse racing (although they also often hunt) can support a market that sells dozens of cheeses, fresh fruits, special flowers, delicious wines, and even expensive truffles and marine fish (here inland); Every woman and man I saw, the children wore wool, silk, cotton and all kinds of animal skins. Synthetic fibers that are often seen in other towns and villages are extremely rare; every bedroom in the three-story building of Mrs. Alan There is a set of furniture and an attached bathroom. The kitchen has an oven, a dishwasher, a refrigerator, a freezer, a water purifier, a garbage disposal machine, and can be turned on and off with remote control and reservation time. The cabinet contains several varieties. Beautifully hand-painted bone china dishes and brand new silver cutlery, her boys use a fountain pen with spotted enamel, fully automatic electric pencil sharpener, hand-stitched leather Notepad - sand from the hands of the pastel is where the boys came, and Catherine for his mail-order of drawing paper a relatively poor turns out to be different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine is not the first, just don't know if it will be the last one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not that the town will suddenly be completely covered by volcanic ash within a few hours like Pompeii, or that the townspeople will refrain from “institutions” one day. "The cash or loan provided - the latter is less likely than the former. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, the residents here are so "conservative", "pride", "brave". Everyone stands on the side of "justice" and "morality", and An An is safely in a warm and safe home, staring at the despicable "fugitives" who are stupidly called by them to drink and effortlessly With a lot of bonuses symbolizing glory and pride, all are satisfied, happy - perhaps except the red-haired boy who still understands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They don't want, can't, don't. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... About five minutes later, Catherine came out, she was still wearing the previous suit, her hair was wet on her body, and the wound on her cheeks was turned over. Whitening, the nose is swollen more, and the whole person is chilling from the inside to the outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the eyes are very nice, sharp, calm, and full of energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Catherine, I believe you--Sasha’s head, indicating the location of her bath towel, while lazily filled with lead and gray handwriting The ivory black and black coals are used on the artboard - but don't let others know about 'squid'. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the performance of these townspeople, Sasha thinks they don’t know enough, at least not knowing that it has become a dangerous “bait tube”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
