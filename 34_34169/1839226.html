			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Hopkins said politely to the Douglas couple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He drove back to the town, then parked the eye-catching car in the parking lot, hike through the street, along a steep alley Straight down, out of the alley is a small square park where people in the town walk and dance. When Hopkins passes through them, the baby, the old man and the dog curiously look at the stranger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His destination, a small hotel hidden behind the oak and roses, stands quietly in the dark, most of the rooms have windows and balconies Black and faint, only a few lights are on, the top one is, Dr. Hopkins looked up and walked in without hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The front desk of the hotel is small and very high. There is light under the front desk, which illuminates the white ground. The marble is polished very smooth, like a mirror. Violet and Carrara White, Black Gold Flower, Pink Rose (all of which are marble names) combined into a picture - Dr. Hopkins looked through his head and he recognized the picture - Picasso's, "rare and Humorous taste." He whispered, he suddenly wanted to meet the design and allowed people to combine a painting depicting the smashing of abstract paintings on the ground of the hotel reception hall - really interesting, human fear Death has reached a point of hysteria, but in normal life, they love to make fun of death. Young people like to portray their clothes on clothes and skin. Their parents are never afraid to take it in a happy party. The cake is made into the shape of a coffin (and also puts a photo of it on it). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sir," said a young man, standing behind the tall, small front desk, his eyes were confused, maybe he had eaten too much for dinner, he It seems that I am going to fall asleep: "Do you need any help?" Except for Hopkins, there is only one person. He looks boring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins looked at him, "Yes," he said. "I made an appointment with a friend. His name is Abel." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man bowed his head and looked through the notebook. "Okay, sir," he said. "They asked for the room on the top floor. You see, where is the elevator," He pointed to a large translucent mica stone standing vase. The vase has an adult female whose shoulders are so high and wide that they are covered with large peony made of deep red and gold silk. It is dyed black, and the branches of unknown plants are mixed with silver powder on it. "Behind it," he said sullenly. Picking up his toes and looking at Hopkins, he found that he did not bring his luggage, and his eyes showed a disappointing look: "Go all the way to the top floor, turn right, go to the end, the last one is."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins looked at him again. Pull open the windbreaker, pull out the wallet from the inner pocket, and pull out a five-dollar bill. Shaking at the young man: "I still need you to do me a favor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spirit of the young man is finally invigorated, he immediately turned from the back of the front desk "What?" he said diligently: "Do you need a bottle of wine? I can make a recommendation for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," Hope Kings said seriously: "I just want you to write a letter for me." He said, he punched the waiter's ribs. The "Ghoul" fist is harder and heavier than the hammer, and the card is wiped. The ribs were broken and the young man screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the outside man ran in, he found a well-dressed outsider half-squatting on the floor, holding the waiter’s head: "He fell," The man said, "I checked him for a moment, as if I had broken a rib."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you a doctor?" asked one person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course," Dr. Hopkins replied in a serious manner: "Don't move him, call an ambulance, lest the broken ribs poke into the internal organs." ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone asked how the waiter fell, he squinted, confused, and couldn’t figure it out, and finally had to admit that he was not Be careful to slide on the marble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I told Old William that the ground should not be polished too smooth," another said. The third person thinks that it is better to lay the wood on the ground in public places such as hotels, but some people object because the floor wax will be more slippery than the ice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins patiently accompanied them. Five minutes later, the ambulance arrived, and the injured and people thanked Hopkins and agreed that he It is a rare good person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ghoul" nodded humbly, bypassed the vase and walked into the elevator. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elevator is old-fashioned and can only accommodate four people, slow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went to the top floor according to the instructions of the waiter, turned right, walked down the corridor, and a closed wooden door was waiting for him. He walked over. Knocked on the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine opened the door for him. Hopkins waited for a few seconds at the door. When she let go, he was able to walk in when he could see the whole room. There were not many people in the room, and they were all old acquaintances, Catherine. Abel, and the "head" of Babel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without Martin, Catherine and Abel are standing, "heads" sitting on the couch, their faces are very poor - his ribs are pumping in bursts Pain, but not just because of this, he doesn’t know how much his ability has been touched by the “Ghoul”, but at the very least, Anthony Hopkins already knows that he has a small part of his thoughts attached to others. When getting the information, the injury suffered by that person will also be reflected in him. On the island of Kamila, where the squid is raised, he retreats in time, so that he did not let the old man’s cheek The fist on it affected himself - this time he took a slow step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn’t think that Anthony Hopkins will spend five dollars asking the waiter to give them a surprise or a small gift, just concentrate on him and listen At that time, the man was smashed, and the pain he suffered was conveyed to the "head". He fell to the carpet and scared Catherine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good evening," Hopkins said in a gentle manner, he looked around the room for a week and finally stopped at the door to the bedroom, two bedrooms. The doors are all open, and they are empty: "You, seeing you again is a happy thing," he looked at "Head: "But it seems that one is missing, if I remember correctly," he intimately Said: "What about Martin? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I sent him to do another job." "The head" said with no fear that the "Ghoul" is a dangerous person, but he is not a lamb. His ability is of course not only manifested, but as long as he has a little brain power, he will think. Try to keep one hand. In addition to the cocky Martin, every time his abilities develop or extend, he will know all over the world.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regret," Hopkins said: "I can't wait to see him. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence can be said to be quite a bit of truth, "head" thinks, Anthony Hopkins wants to kill Martin, no doubt, If it wasn’t for him that he still had Sasha Hopkins in his arms – and he, Catherine, and Abel were still there, Martin might not have escaped the catastrophe, oh, maybe delete Catherine. She might be able to Her former partner, who died because of Catherine's waywardness, endured not killing Martin, but would definitely be happy to stand by. But he can't let things go on like this, the people he can use on his hands are too Less. "Ghoul" can be said to be a "partner" now, but who can expect a madman to do it?! In the six months after the agency handed over the information of the rewarder, he killed four of the rewarders in one breath. - The ghosts believe that they died because of various accidents, such as the idiot who likes to play Batman. The police concluded that he sucked too much. The illusion caused by the drug caused him to kill a girl and then commit suicide. But the "head" has never heard A person can use a silver spoon to break the abdomen and suicide around the neck - it is a living, human skin with muscles and skin, not a rotten pork belly cooked in a soup pot! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn't know what the agency thought. The use of this kind of guy is simply waving a sword without a handle, or they don't think about it because they don't have to personally face him face-to-face, and they have to count on him to play a big role in the next action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you see Martin." Hopkins said: "Remember to help me." He said flatly, "I will kill him." After thinking about it, he added: "If circumstances permit, I will design a new way of death for him." His tone is like a new way of inventing a cucumber. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "head" sight stayed on his body for a while, and he had to admit that this change seemed to be a real appearance. His feelings are not only harmless but also Sven, clean. Not only outside, but also inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you see Martin," "The head said:" I will tell you. "He really doesn't mind getting the little ball that jumps off to get a real lesson, after his man is no longer so urgent.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you," Hope Kings said that he took his two straight legs and sat down in front of the sofa and sat down with the 'head': "Do you want the waiter to bring the bottle of wine up?"<br /><br />&nbsp [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said this, the ribs of the "head" began to hurt again: "No," he endured, not taking candy from his pocket to eat, although this is already well known. But he still hopes that the man in front of him can know as little as possible: "I am afraid there is no one on the service desk... Give us a bottle of perrier soda. I think Mr. Hopkins would like this brand, Catherine. There are ice cubes and lemons."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine was a little hesitant, but Abel gave her a look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This hotel is clean and warm, and has a good sound insulation effect caused by heavy walls. The configuration inside is not worth mentioning, even the top floor is the best. The suites are also TV sets in the bedroom, old-fashioned, blurred, and there is only cheap mineral water and sugared pigmented drinks in the small refrigerator in the shared hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine went out and the three men waited quietly for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She went downstairs." Abel said on the terrace: "When you go far, perrier soda is sold here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
