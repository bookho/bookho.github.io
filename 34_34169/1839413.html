			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or because of the increasingly bloated body (to a peculiar level), Chegaler than Sangdi is more spacious and empty than before. Space, but he wants to have enough furniture, so his bedroom is three or four times as large as other rooms, connected to an area almost equal to the room, a terrace that overlooks the sea directly, saddle brown oak cabinet And the table and chairs are placed close to the wall and corners, and the dark green brown floor - according to the habits of the Poseidon Island, they use the ship's board of the old ship that can no longer be used to make the floor. It was sunburned in the scorching sun, washed by the waves, crashed, ruptured, beaten and bitten by sea beasts or sharks, filled with barnacles and oysters, and the ship's nails deeply embedded in their bodies were rusted and left on the wood. A deep black mark, day after day, year after year, when they can no longer be pushed into the sea, carrying their owners to catch sardines and tuna, the mottled look is really ugly. It's better to use it for flooring, because it doesn't rot or worm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a hand-made fine wool carpet in the center of the room, which is similar to the cocoa color with milk added. The pattern is very fine and the shape of the back is a little thin. But this was personally woven by the old Andriana. She also woven a large shawl to cover the back of the huge soft leather seat. She also gave Chekale several pairs of oversized slippers. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of the previous day, Chekal. Bisang is in the black throne of the soft lambskin. Compared to the seat, it is specially made. The furniture looks more like an open bird's nest, his feet buried in the thorny wool felt slippers. Holding a plate of biscuits in both hands, the moonlight illuminates his fat-like dough, and casts a dark black shadow in his position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He used to be very handsome, really, Besib. It is like him. Especially after he grew up, it was a wonderful replica, but some old-fashioned old guys thought that he was always less bloody than his father, not that he lacked courage and courage. It’s just that he is a bit sentimental in many cases, but there are also people who hold the opposite attitude. The latter believes that a ruler with concerns may be more suitable for the current Poseidon Island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only a small number of people can enter this room, including of course the son of Chegaler Bissand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishb took off his shoes. Then came the coat, and Old Andriana didn't even let him go back to his room first. His shoes and coat were covered with sand and dust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Have you seen Anthony Hopkins?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." Besib said: "You let me not contact anyone." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He went to see his son," Chegal said. "The helicopter sent him and then picked you back. I thought you would run into it." Nodded, indicating that Besib was sitting on an armchair facing him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He should go directly to the hospital," Besib said. "Sasha has run into an explosion."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The injury that can get the child into the hospital is not too light." Chegal understands, "I hope I didn't make you too embarrassed, you definitely want to see him." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib swayed his head slightly. Emotional use has always been the tradition of the Poseidon Island people. The exception is Big Hopkins. This dangerous person has long been respected by the Poseidon Island people with his own abilities and wisdom. He has done a lot of things and gained benefits and rights. Not much, in return he was isolated from the control of "Masoye". He can't follow the actions of the people of Poseidon, but they can't do it. He is not only a sea god island, but also their future leader. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can go see him later." Besib said. Trying to get rid of the deepest point of uneasiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Soon," Chegaler promised: "It’s just a little bit of something to let you know, although we still have to wait a little longer, but I promise this. It won't waste you too much time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't matter," Besib said: "I would also like to sit with you."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's right," Chegaler: "Sometimes I will laugh at Anthony Hopkins - sometimes he is like having a daughter instead of a son, but I have to admit that occasionally some sweet snacks are also very good... They often dance together, play the piano, read and cook in the kitchen - don't count on me when playing the piano, others are, but we can drink together Order wine, eat some biscuits, biscuits made by Old Andriana, chili biscuits."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to drink?" Besib replied with respect Road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I remember that I still have a bottle of liqueur." Chegal said: "Ireland, add vodka to it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems like old Andrea I am preparing to use this as a milk pudding," Besib pulled out the bottle and the cup: "Are you sure she doesn't know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a big deal. "Celegal said rogue, he squirmed his neck, Besib guessed he wanted to shrug his shoulders: "I want to give it to me. Drinking and eating is not much different."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bessie smiled heavily. He poured a large cup for Cigalle and gave himself a half cup. The milky white wine tasted thick and sweet. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Celegal. Bisangdi is not a person who likes to chatter and good at memories, but he really has a little more tonight than he used to, maybe he just wants Want to comfort your son? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unusually, Besib feels tired. The armchair under him is also one of Chegal’s lairs. It is large, soft and exudes leather. The aroma, filled with countless small fluffy pillows properly support his back and waist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you are tired," Chegal said: "You can take a nap."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Bishb didn’t talk, and did not follow Chegar’s words. He looked at the floor-to-ceiling windows and doors leading to the terrace. The house of “Don” is of course different from ordinary people. The floor-to-ceiling windows and doors of the terrace are used. It is a tempered double-layer glass with a polycarbonate layer that absorbs some of the energy generated during the impact and explosion. Only heavy guns can be used to break them from the outside, but people inside can shoot people outside. - The latest one-way bulletproof glass, used by banks and police stations in the West China. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door and window are now closed, and the fresh air installation is still working, but the room is inevitably filled with unnatural hot flashes. The light of the light is yellow and ochre, and the air seems to be semi-solidified with weight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He bowed his head to look at the black pattern on the floor, the rusted ship nails left on the wood after decades of wood, the wood was polished smooth. A dark stain was facing his face like a clown laughing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chili biscuits, Besib dizzy and thought, this is still the one that Sasha brought to Poseidon. This is a dysfunctional guy... everything is spinning... He hasn’t felt tired for a long time, he and Sasha I have tried to stay asleep for two weeks. Madonna, in the past two weeks, he probably saw a book with half a library... It’s safe...soft...he is protected here...it’s his father...he feels he’s already ...he can still hear the sound outside (very light, like whispering), feeling the light outside (very vague, like a translucent film). But the touch of the fingers and soles has disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is no good, Besib stubbornly wants to stand up, he stands up, fluttering, his eyes are unclear, he pats his cheeks and blinks his eyes The skin received a gentle pressure. But still business as usual, the son of the thug leader’s heart is anxiously unreasonable, this is not the case. He said to himself, and said to the father who had been sitting in the chair, I don't want to sleep, no, no, it is very dangerous. Where is the danger? I don't know, I can't go on like this anyway - he turned and stared at the door of the terrace. They were horrified to find that they were open and there was no wind or air coming in. Everything is still quiet, stable, he goes out, his toes are light and warm, just like the living ground - he stands on the terrace, the sky is bright, the sea and the earth are like a painting , huge, continuous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not what he saw, but it appears directly in his mind. Many people think that this is what they see - vision is a physiological vocabulary. Light acts on the visual organs, making the sensory cells excited, and the information captured by the sensory cells is sent to the visual nervous system for processing to produce vision, so it is difficult for ordinary people to distinguish between "thinking" and "real" seeing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib is not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tried to yell, his tongue and lips were still motionless—the sound he heard...and his brain told him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no movement behind Chegaler than Sangdi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Andreas sitting in Chegaler Outside the door, accompanying the old woman is her favorite rocking chair, a woolen basket with crochet hooks and chicken yellow ochre yarn, and she is ready to hook a hat for the leader. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room is cutler. Bisangdi, if anyone still recognizes the meat that overflows the entire room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one knows that Old Andriana is still a witch, but unfortunately when she has this power, she is old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She tiptoed, pushing the rocking chair, the crochet under the hand kept on, while still paying attention to the movement inside, "You should have done this, Chegal "She said: "Procrastination is not good for anyone." She also likes the child of Besib, but unfortunately his weight is still too light compared to Chegal. As long as Chegal eats the child, his body's horrifying crashing power can be stopped. This is the judgment of Old Andriana. Although she is not a doctor, her ability is much better. For any professional person - she is patiently saying like a sister who is responsible for giving bitter medicine to a disobedient brother: "Your body is shouting to eat the child, I can hear it, cut Le, you have to satisfy it - you should be able to feel it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Celegal feels so, so he simply sent the child far away, almost Don't meet him alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He may feel that it is time to hand Poseidon Island and "Masoye" to Besib, but Old Andriana does not think so, she It tends to be more insured. If Chekal can eat Besib, he should be able to live for decades, enough for him to cultivate another heir, a married child, more powerful and colder. More... Haishen Island is a little bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little fool Besib probably didn’t know that there were a lot of people on the island who were dissatisfied with him. He thought he was disguised very well, but he liked to eat grass. Will the wolf not be suspected of being a sheep? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crochet paused, and Old Andreana remembered Sasha Hopkins, a little angel, Chegal. Bisangdi took him. As a sea god island to raise, but Anthony Hopkins seems to have different opinions - the people of Poseidon who have worked with him are always "regret". Most of them are stupid, it is difficult to accurately describe their feelings, but probably the old Andriana can still understand - he is more capable of "good", but always parked there, not willing Go one step further. Not willing to stand with them - this is more boring than a coward, traitor or selfish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She bowed her head and continued her work, but it didn’t matter. When Besib died, the child and his father would leave. Maybe someone wants to let them silence forever. Then she still has to find a way for those who are daring to dispel this idea. If Hopkins can return to his world, it is good for Poseidon and "Masoy". After all, wait until the next heir to go to the Western continent. It takes at least twenty years to go to college. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not make a difference and subordinates. At the very least, you can become a "friend". "Tang" always has many friends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Andreas straightened his waist and heard the bones screaming - Sasha Hopkins would be sad, she It’s also because of this that Anthony Hopkins got out of this. Who knows what this guy who sees his son is more important than anything else? Anthony Hopkins is a fine and keen villain. He is good at detecting clues and is good at catching every fleeting gap. Old Andriana is not sure to control him - so. Even if it was an emergency - when she received a notice about the bombing, she knew it was a good chance that she might not have it again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The injury that can make a person coma coma is not a small problem, not to mention that there are many enemies in the Western Confucius. Anthony Hopkins will surely rush over. Old Andriana is going to recall Bisib in the name of Chegal. In case, just in case, she will probably be inclined to Besib. For example, Bep. Amp, a small group of bastards, and Pei Pei. After all, he did the adoptive father of Besib for more than ten years, and she sent them all to the Western continent - well. The next step is Chekal. Bisangdi is very simple. He has little precautions against her, and his body is already very fragile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that reminds her is Besib, but fortunately this child also believes in her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meat pieces are on the other side of the door, do they eat light? It shouldn't be there yet. Besib is a tenacious child. His body is healthy and strong, and his will is very firm. It is not easy to leave him in his own mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poor child seems to have noticed that it is wrong,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but...it’s too late . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyone who has a little medical knowledge will think that Sasha. Pukins is still in deep sleep. He is too quiet to sleep. Even his eyes are motionless. If a doctor connects him with a brainwave, the results given by the technology will not be different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only Anthony Hopkins knows that he is not sleeping - the anesthetic expires half an hour ago, in the instinct of the self-protection of the abilities, Sasha. Hopkins woke up in the next moment of drug failure. When he saw his father, he didn’t have time to say a word, and he hurriedly fell into a coma again—just a short sigh, compared with him. The father of Anthony Hopkins came to a warm and happy little, and he obviously had more important things to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one knows how many hiding places Anthony Hopkins has. The place where they live today is only one of the most inconspicuous places. A doctor’s private clinic, he got a lot of money from Anthony Hopkins. After that, he simply carried the baggage and boarded the plane that could leave the fastest. The nurses, patients and cleaners in the clinic received urgent notice, and the water and electricity charges were paid. The clinic has exquisite and complete instruments and instruments. And drugs, as well as bedrooms, bathrooms and kitchens. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one will bother them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins used a syringe to feed the sand with honey, cleaned his body, and changed his clothes (smooth and loose cotton) If his speculation is true (which is very likely), then they have to wait here for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After doing all this, he sat down on the chair and closed his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a lot of little boys on the Westland will share a cement tube, tree house or trash can with their friends, there is also a Sasha and Besib Sharing the secret room, as a father, Anthony Hopkins was neither surprised nor angry, he even thought it was cute. He also sneaked in and enjoyed it for a while - leaving an anchor point when he left, as long as he was willing, he could arrive at the anchor at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, Sasha is in front of everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Hopkins grabbed the anchor easily, and the two children’s cabins were built outside the Hopkins’ memory palace, alone Floating in a beautiful sea of ​​stars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha sat on the floor of the hut, the house was in a mess, and he was holding his body-deficient Besib, looking calm, seeing Anthony Hope He was obviously relieved when he was in Kings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you let him project the outside directly?" Dr. Hopkins said: "This is very painful." In the spiritual world, as long as you want Ok, it will be fine. This room is shared by Sasha and shared with Besib. He can restore himself to the healthiest state, but they can’t know how bad the situation is. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And projection - Besib can create the body of thought through his own sensory nerves, what the outside body becomes, and what it is inside - - He has no ears and hair, one less eye, elbows, bones can be seen below the knees, there are several holes in the chest and abdomen that are expanding, the internal organs are also missing, and the wounds are very small. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
