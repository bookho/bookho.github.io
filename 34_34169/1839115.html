			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bodies that have been manually tested are pushed back into the freezer (with pulleys underneath the freezer so they can be easily fed into the elevator or pulled out of the elevator) ), the freezer was sent to the elevator, several transporters stood next to the freezer, and the elevator door closed in front of Tom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tom had to put his hand into his trouser pocket, close to the groin, hoping that the high temperature could bring some comfort to his hands - every finger and two palms They are all frozen and painful, numb, and the corpse is a terrible thing. They lie quietly, but they can absorb the heat and life of a living person like some evil and abominable things, and then spit out the chilly Dead air, like a tree will suck in carbon dioxide and spit out oxygen - Tom used to see the dead in hospitals and funeral homes, but they never let him be so cold and frightened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elevator is squatting in the dark, the elevator is brightly lit, but as Tom feels, the mental and physical aspects of the living in the elevator are simultaneously It is cool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let them get less refrigerant," one of the transporters yelled. He turned his head and spit in the corner of the elevator. Sticky cockroaches: "It’s ice cubes that spit out from my mouth." He looked at other people and tried to find a companion from the middle who had similar feelings: "How long do we have to stay here?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A older man frowned at his words, he pouted his lips and gave a prayer similar to a curse, with one hand behind his back, making a very old Rare, a gesture to ward off evil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a low-speed elevator." Another person said: "At the top, at least ** minutes, you have to..." The snoring of the elevator suddenly stopped. The people in the elevator obviously felt the body shaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, nothing to panic," previous The man continued: "As I said, if everything goes well, it will be ** minutes. If it is like this, I mean, if there is a routine inspection, then I don't know how long it will take. Rest assured," he added. Just some scans to see if you have something that has not been notified.” He looked up, the entire elevator bridge was covered with light stainless steel, no armrests around, and cold metal on the top, light It penetrates through the gap of the metal plate. As in the past, he couldn't find anything similar to the monitoring probe, only to see a few faint smog swirling down from the top. He couldn't figure out whether the smoke came out from the top of the elevator or the condensation of the refrigerant, but after one or two breaths, he found that his companion's face was suddenly swollen, magnified, he wanted to talk. Asking questions, but the tongue has been completely numb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stumbled in the elevator with his colleagues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elevator was silent, after a dozen seconds, it again made a slight squeak, along the two large and solid rails all the way up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is really inside?" Martin asked: "It is shipping." Person? I didn't see him. Or the body? Can he really hold his breath for so long? Why didn't they notice that he had heartbeat and temperature?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Who knows, maybe he is really able to pause for 45 minutes by lowering his heart rate like Lapagos, and don't forget that we have never dealt with an ordinary person," he is also crowded with. Abelie in front of the monitor said with sarcasm, his sharp eyes fixed on the LCD screen with twenty-five inches: "Of course, there may be an 'empty pocket', we are not sure that he will乖乖 In accordance with what we mean, he never called our head to confide in the heart - this possibility is the intelligence analysis department based on his past style, means, hobbies and information provided to him by the anesthesiologist, and The conversation between the two - this is the most likely... but not 100% & Nbsp;; & nbsp; & nbsp "<br <br /> & nbsp />;“In a nutshell, is it possible for us to wait six hours in this lovely and exquisite small room?” Martin interrupted him sourly: “The poor transporters are really blown by this bad wind ( The wind that makes everyone unlucky is the evil wind.)"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It can be solved with a needle neutralizer, they have a little headache at most." Abel is a bit Impatiently, he knows that this young man and Anthony Hopkins have a deep hatred, and the former may prefer to dominate this bonus alone, especially when the prey has fallen into the trap and is within reach. The place where he is not satisfied is here - not really sympathizing with the unrelated people involved: "Well, I should go." He turned and nodded to the members of the action group. It is a greeting, and his ability is not suitable for use in such a place - there is no mouse except his peers, innocent people, and a criminal who may also appear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is not because of this, he must also participate in this action - the practice of the organization, when rounding up a criminal, the previous action group Members have the right and the right to join - they have a "face to face" experience, which is a valuable and intangible wealth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine? Oh, you all know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aberdeen stepped out of the machine room, Martin swayed his fingers behind his body, blue and white currents circling around his fingertips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin’s bad mood has been maintained until the elevator that may carry a criminal enters the engine room, the emergency control system is turned on, and the elevator cable drum is fixed. The claw-shaped brakes started, and the elevator doors that rise vertically rise slowly... Before the others had not acted as planned, Martin suddenly flashed two people in front of him, rushed up and pressed ten fingers into the elevator. On the bridge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strong current slammed through the metal plate of the elevator and passed through the metal plate to the stunned humans and the corpses in the freezer bag. The lights flashed. After a few moments, it was extinguished. Under the blue flash of current, the members of the action group waiting outside the door looked at the transport personnel who should have been unconscious. They screamed and raised their heads and necks, and shocked each one. The nerves, every muscle, every inch of skin brought about, the huge, uncontrollable pain caused them to scream and scream, the tongue stretched out - Martin smiled in the shadow of the elevator, his fingers left the elevator For a few seconds, only the team members grabbed the guys’ hair and dragged them away from the dangerous place, and then he put his fingers back—in the buzz of electricity, wrapped in a silver bag The body suddenly trembled and straightened up! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martinie laughs, the current is strengthening in his laughter, he feels great, and he never thought that the original plan had been taken by his private actions. A mess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One minute, or two minutes later, everyone in the room smelled a strange smell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, like frozen meat that has been roasted, a dirty, greasy, cold, smoky...<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw his mother, the mother was alive, sitting on the balcony of the wicker chair, she closed her eyes, breathing smoothly, fixing herself into a beautiful line The sculpture, the golden hair, is made into a smooth bun, wearing the elastic black tights that the dancer likes, revealing only his face, hair and hands and feet. Her head rests on one side of the shoulder, both hands Opened on the arm of the wicker chair, the legs were curled up and the feet were placed side by side in the corner of the wicker chair. Her fingers and toenails showed a healthy light red color without nail polish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
