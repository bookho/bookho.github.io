			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great Hopkins looked at this strange new place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The space that can be created by a brain of about 1400 grams is not square or cubic. It can be as small and narrow as a snail. Being as vast as the ocean, everyone can go in and out as they please, because it is produced by itself, from 12 to 14 billion brain cells, you can walk, jump or fly freely. And build any of the things you want, including your own body, and be able to change or disappear anytime, anywhere - but the biggest difficulty is fixing something, making them regular and Obeying order—Human thoughts are faster than light, and they are not always well-balanced. For a while, for a while, they change so fast that some people can't even detect the difference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s dangerous to break into someone else's mind – whether or not you have received an invitation. Nothing, no experience, no IQ, how can you be safe? When the owner of this space can't control the monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To date, there are only two places where Dr. Hopkins can stay in peace, one belongs to his wife and the other belongs to his son. And these two places are built under his guidance and guidance - through their usual surprises, chattering, plain and direct dialogue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine’s world consists of three aspects, she and her parents’ house (they were forced to move away after her father’s death in office), and later The motel - her mother was inside to collect the wet condoms and the sheets of the car and the car, and finally the morgue and laboratory that Hopkins built for her, very bright, clean, her father's bone Hidden under the white cotton cloth, Catherine occasionally sat on another bed and cried. The world of Sasha is more peculiar and simpler, perhaps because the memory is preserved from the time of the baby, a large part of the space is occupied by the rainforest, the quiet turbid river, the hot and humid air, the arbor of the slab tree roots, The raw vines, ferns and moss, colorful, countless animals, birds, bats and insects, his memory is as heavy as the fruit hanging on the dark branches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doctor Hopkins sees a new world, a dark, round cave, a small pool of groundwater, with numerous translucent hangings The silk thread, as his movements sway slightly, each one seems to be covered with diamond powder, sparkling, and the mucus falls from the end of the thread, causing tiny waves on the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“A new location,” Hopkins said, of course he knew where the scenery would be: “very beautiful.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“And safe.” Sasha said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope it has the same level of comfort." Hopkins said that he accepted the little show off with tolerance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not bad," Sasha said. "I don't expect more preparation time." He paused briefly: "Even for two people." "That," said Hopkins, blinking his eyes: "Bishb is here." He smiled thoughtfully. The tone softly added: "It's wonderful, it's worth a bonus. How is he?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Strong, tired, hungry, but I think these are already Solved, but there is no guarantee that he will not have a headache when he wakes up," Sasha said. "In any case, today is a memorable day - he used his ability for the first time." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With your help," said Dr. Hopkins, and then got the default for Sasha. He turned around in the cave without saying a word, and observed his son without any trace. "You have a lot of troubles." He sat down, and immediately under the buttocks came a cold and hard touch, he satisfied Sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha stared at him, "just thought of a possibility." He admitted: "One question," he asked: "When is Chegal? What happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins showed a real smile: "5:33."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The person in the main house was notified after 9:10."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Signal shielding, let's go A very long way." Hopkins propped his finger on his chin jaw: "Of course, if..." He rubbed his skin with his fingertips: "It's not too late, Maya. Ray’s people didn’t start until around 9:15.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“They were almost stuck in the room.” Sasha commented on the matter Dao: "It's a bad movie, coincidence, plus coincidence, but in fact, if you don't have me, Besib is now a fish in the net."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"That's really unfortunate," Hopkins said sincerely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Meyare’s action is too slow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because he can't do it It’s too obvious,” Dr. Hopkins said. “It’s a felony to kill a relative in Poseidon. The criminal will be lynched.” And if Chekale does not exist, no matter how many sons he has, it’s useless. Ray has his own son, and he may be generous enough to allow Besib to continue to live as a son. After all, there are not many people who know this. The problem is that even Mei Yalei does not know how many people know about this. In order to get rid of the suspicion, he can’t show everything in the next moment when Chegal is attacked. Master the look inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had to wrap a sloppy skin patiently waiting for the results, he waited, and Chegal was safe and sound, he was still alive. Meyer was not able to go to this stage, and it was the turn of Chekale. He had to grasp the weight that would make Chegal’s jealousy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beibb did not receive any warnings, reminders, or hints of concealment beforehand. There is no Sasha, but he does not think that Besib has a palace of memory that can be connected to his father at any time. And there is no doubt that Chegal will win, Hopkins never stands on the side of the loser, Sasha does not believe that Chegal really betrayed and murdered Meyer as he presented to people. Nothing to know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What makes Meyare think that Besib is a good enough to turn over?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I." Hopkins clap his hands and sing and replied: "It's me, of course it's me." He has a good voice, the bass is especially beautiful, and there are two high-quality resonance boxes in the chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In comparison, Sasha seems to be more calm, targeted misleading and fooling is not a difficult thing for Hopkins, at least It is much easier for a person to be willing to eat his face happily, although the tragic consequences of the two are comparable, "Chegal?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Chelhal," Hopkins continued to sing: "Who can it? Chegal, only Chegal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ghoul raised one hand, the left hand with only a scar. The hand had six fingers. He pressed his finger on his lips. He looked at Sasha carefully, from his The hair looks, then the forehead, eyes, nose and shoulders, arms... all the way to the toes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are angry," he said affirmatively. "For your children? It's rare that he only got along with you for such a short time," he said sweetly. "It really makes me a little bit sloppy, my little eggplant, Really, I thought you have to wait a while to feel these - friends, a good friendship, and so on. Oh, oh, oh, don't deny, don't rush to deny." Dr. Hopkins seriously Say: "Deny your feelings is a very bad thing, um, that is almost equivalent to denying yourself. Come on, nothing embarrassed, having a friend is a good thing."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't deny it." Sasha narrowed his eyes, and now he is really like Big Hopkins. "But I think I should at least know, how long can this friendship last?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doctor Hopkins rolled up his lips: "Talk ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is being used as a cover and bait," Sasha said. "Cechal has never told him anything, and may not have told them. People who are emotionally closer to Besib, he wants everything around him to be as calm and steady as he is - so that he can, at least on the bright side, persuade others to believe that he does not know anything about Meyare’s crimes. - His counterattack was forced. He was first betrayed and murdered. He was the victim. He was about to seek justice. He was still on the side of justice and never wavered. Now Chegal has escaped and has already In planning a counterattack - but he has to figure out who has completely invested in Meyare, the easiest and safest way is to cast a big bait that Mayare can't refuse and conspicuous - whether he has already made a public Is the identity of Besib? Or he will ask his enemies not to hurt in the statement. The only son?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins’s fingers changed to the tip of his nose, he gently sniffed, the air was salty And the special smell of insects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Accurate," he said: "There are several big fish that are running behind you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You should probably know," Hopkins said carelessly: "The abnormal mortality rate of Poseidon Island has always been high. No, specifically, there are three or four guys who can live to be in their teens in every ten bodies. They can’t die in their own loved ones – but they always have one or two Undead enemies, or some ulterior motives, bad hobbies that hurt your body, or unfortunately suffer from strange and acute illnesses that you have never heard of. Sometimes, they will encounter various kinds of All kinds of accidents - like the brothers of Chegal - to be honest, half a dozen brothers are actually a little more... Because of this, his last brother fell into the sea after drowning because of drunkenness He adopted the widow of his brother, and the name of Meyer was taken by him.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
