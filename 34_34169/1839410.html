			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Confidence, huh?" Catherine said, she lifted a leg and placed it on her other leg. This movement was half a century. When she was conquered by a female actor, she conquered almost all men and a small number of women. Catherine did not give up, thanking the versatile person for his unique physiology, compared with her more than a decade ago. There is no trace of aging, her muscles and skin are still tight, her lips are full, her eyes are bright, and she is only a child born in September this year. When Douglas walks together, it doesn’t make people feel that something is wrong. Where is the child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QiZi stared at her and watched as she pulled out a pack of cigarettes from the back pocket of a jeans like the second layer of skin, and a miniature made into a cigarette shape. lighter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine ignited a cigarette without asking for the approval of Chiz, and took a sigh of relief. The next moment, Chiz smelled a rich mixture. With the smell of chocolate and sweet cream, she couldn't help but turn her head and coughed twice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The older woman showed a smug smile. "This is not good, dear," her smile magnified: "You just swear Go to deal with the heirs of a mob leader and a ghoul accustomed to putting the same kind on the menu - but you are afraid of a cigarette."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Don't confuse fear and disgust," Chiz said. "And I didn't want to deal with the two."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, what should I say? Catherine said with amazement that the white smoke haunted her face: "It's amazing, except for the inexplicable confidence - you seem to have a lot of places you like. For example, self-knowledge "She spit out a round, very standard smoke ring, and the rest of the smoke was pressed under her tongue, and it leaked a little bit with the vibration of her tongue and lips:" Besib. Sasha Hopkins lived together for twelve years, little girls, they were born On a closed island, although there is a network, it is obvious that neither Hopkins nor Sangdi is the kind of idiot that will seek emotional comfort in the virtual world - they eat together and play together. Study together. Train together - certainly not football training and swimming training, they have no mother, only a strong father who loves them and deserves their respect and fear, they are inherently stronger than others. Whether it is ordinary people or The abilities... They will sleep together many times. On the same bed - no. You know that I don't mean that, but you have to understand, this means that Besib is against Sasha. Sasha is against Besib. They are unprepared with each other - when they grow up, they have to go to work, so it is a natural and normal thing to give their back to the other person with confidence - like this one Yeah, dear, what do you want to do? Your weight is only slightly higher than one of the 'classmates'. You love Sasha, but he doesn't love you," Catherine said cruelly and straightforwardly. A gesture, the cigarette was caught in front of her middle finger and index finger: "He doesn't even like you, he is alerting you, keeping you alienated and indifferent, because your father is killed by Besib. For you, for him, is the enemy of his closest brother and friend, understand? Enemy? You stood on the opposite side from the beginning, you want to be close, but it will only be regarded as a threat." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, yes," Catherine continued, using that abhorrent and indifferent tone: "You can say, you have no feelings for your biological father, you don't care who made a hole in his head. He flew his half skull, you will love Besib, love the murderer, you will also make your hand dish for him to eat, give him a birthday present and kiss him - you can't do it Carson, I can see that you are not a bad girl with no conscience. Sasha knows too - as you said, Sasha Hopkins is the right arm of Tang in the future, you think he will marry him and him. Brothers have deep hatred, women who can take his life at any time to be a wife?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He won’t, you know very well, the biggest possibility, he will marry a sea god The girl on the island, Besib said, it is better to be his wife’s sister, so that they are even shackles. Before that, all the female companions of Little Hopkins were one-time or non-permanent, Sand himself knows that Lila, besides that you and I know well, is by his side. There is no girl, because he knows that there will be no result, then he simply saves the flowers - a good boy, isn't he?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He Very kind and gentle.” Chiz said quietly: “Having a sense of justice.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine smiled silently. “There will be many people crying. From their graves - because of this evaluation, although the 'mineral judge' never kills, but his punishment is more terrible than death, and the person who passed the hand is not mad, but also committed suicide. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But he doesn't like this," Chiz retorted: "He prefers to be a good person," like in the elevator, he can let go. Let Dr. Smith and Lore fall, don't say that the monitoring equipment has completely failed. Even if there isn't, no one will blame an adult who will not be able to hold two adults close to three hundred pounds. I only rely on three or four fingers to support the full weight. "He has been kidnapped all the time," Chiz muttered. "Being his father, being his friend, being his heart and emotions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This She did not say anything wrong, Catherine lowered her eyes: "Okay," she said: "Going to the point, how are you going to solve Besib. Bisangdi? I mean, his influence on Sasha? Nothing in Sasha Let's get close to you. Let's talk about it? Then we can go on to discuss Anthony Hopkins." The last name she almost blew out from the teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chez Carson turned his head and stared at the woman shrouded in the smoke. After a while, she smiled slowly: "We are a country." Yes, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s very early," Catherine said. "I want to hear from you. I really don't like Besib and Anthony Hopkins, but at least they haven't personally hurt and betrayed Sasha Hopkins." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She did not accidentally see Chiz Carson wince. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, if your cards only have the so-called 'acquired mutations', then you don't have to say anything... from the next second At the beginning of the clock, you'd better be able to stay away from my child – remember the pain just now? It was given to me by a madman who had forcibly performed a curettage without anesthesia for 20 minutes. And you only feel five seconds, and it has not been strengthened - but as long as I am willing, I can let this pain continue indefinitely." She put her finger on the naked neck of Chiz, Chiz hit a Chilling, Catherine's fingernails are very smooth, flat, and soft at the fingertips, but Chiz feels like a vampire bat with a fluff on her neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine’s fingers are a little hotter than the average person, she caressing Chiz’s neck carelessly: “Don’t be surprised how I know, the abilities have abilities In the circle of people, we exchange information with each other. In addition, those 'after-the-day abilities' made by Samuel are not news anymore. Maybe you haven't noticed it - the squid tragedy, which is happening in the carp farm. In the case of kidnapping and murder, not only did several adults die, but also an innocent little girl, only five or six years old, who was fed a squid after being corpse and was broadcast live. About 200 million people watched this video. - This is something more than a decade ago, and the culprit in this case is an acquired power, a woman who can become a man."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The 'institutions' I serve are full of abilities, and we are basically responsible for the cases committed by the abilities, and in the past 10 years, the cases of the acquired abilities have accounted for four points in all cases. one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did they say it to you? Give you health, give you the ability, and long youth and longevity? Can you win the qualifications alongside the people you like? And what do you want to do with this power? Cruelly stripping Besib and Anthony from Sasha's memory and heart, and then cutting it off? Catherine pressed the cigarette that was about to be extinguished directly into his hand: "If I didn't pull you out, are you ready to do this?" Or, what else do you want to leave in the subconscious of Sasha? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Anthony Hopkins will tear you apart," Catherine leaned down and breathed on the face of Chiz, her iris is A ruthless steel blue: "I will. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
