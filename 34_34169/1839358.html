			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An ordinary and busy day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jessie and her partner Mike visited two sexual assaulters who were released from prison. Harassed six gang members, arrested two pickpockets, three du mercenaries, a stupid gun robber - his gun went off, hit himself, the owner had to call the ambulance at the same time as the alarm Come, when the day's patrol mission is about to end, they also caught a drunken, three drunks at 4 o'clock in the afternoon. He actually made Jessie in plain clothes a one--Jessie, who was constantly entangled by him. I turned on the recording device and read the Miranda Declaration to him after I got enough testimony - not because he tried to swear (this evidence is not enough), but because he hindered law enforcement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it too hot?" Jessie said with anger when she got into the car, she did dress up because she was going to work after work. She went straight to her boyfriend's date, but she just wore a beautiful gemstone blue jeans and a black tight t-shirt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, no," she partnered as she started the car and smiled and said: "Compared to Ferrola, you are a good point for you." Student."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a relaxed and true smile, and the anger in Jessie’s heart gradually dispersed. Just before Easter, two innocent children were illegal. The children’s boxing match was killed by their opponents because they were proved to have survived for a month after being kidnapped. The Lafayette bureau was pushed to the court of public opinion and morality, directly The police detectives in charge of the case were forced to take long vacations, and their directors were likely to be defeated in the next election. They could not say that they had no responsibility at all, but the people of Lafayette did not expect when they were condemning and refueling. Is it because they are passionate and supportive of the boxing gambling that led to all this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This case has a particularly strong impact on Jesse’s partner, because one of the victims is the only child of his old partner who had previously lost his job, the old partner’s copper Like the erected doorway, there is lighting at night, and he sees it several times a day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He showed her photos of Ferrola, Jessie is hard to imagine that guys like Mike’s slate will like this look like a Addicts, hippies and girls who are homeless (maybe she is). But what is love? No one can tell, like her current boyfriend, a guy who is idle but has a lot of money, tastes vulgar. Described as a cockroach, it is very suitable for being pointed at the gun, ordered to kneel on the ground, face against the ground, hands on the back and picked up - she is doing this, when they met in the first game - I am sorry, but who Didn't force him to live in a home with a murderous gang member, right? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stared at her for a long time before being put into the police car. She thought he would swear or threaten her, but he sent her a bunch of roses and a parcel on the third day after being released on bail. Small pistol pendant in a leather case. She checked the small pistol, which was only about two inches long, and found that it was actually usable. "It can of course kill people." Her current boyfriend said, "Why would I have to give it to you?" ". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The handle is inlaid with forty-eight diamonds, twelve on the barrel, and a gold chain. It is worth 50,000 yuan. It is hung in a t-shirt or a shirt. As a one, she does not want to attract too many people's eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone wonders why Jesse is dealing with such a hybrid. They think she is for money... Of course not, Jesse’s father is a doctor, and the mother is a little Famous painter. The salary is also very high, from small to large, she has never tasted the taste of being stretched - she can only say - when you see him, you know, yes, that person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin. Her boyfriend thinks so too. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If it wasn't for you," Martin said: "Whether that person is afraid to point the gun at my head, I will fly him/her.唧唧 or **.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She pinched his punitively, and he leaned down and kissed her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay. We are here," Mike said, making an unbearable look: "Let us send this guy to where he should go." Wake up the wine - then you can go see your little boyfriend."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can also call Ferrola," Jesse said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can do it now." Mike said: "You remind me, I have to confirm that she has not changed her itinerary."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When can I get your wedding invitation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She came to meet me first," Mike said. Then we went to see her parents together, and we had to discuss the specific matters, but she told me that if her mother really wanted to invite two hundred guests, we would run away – are you alone?”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go and call your Ferrola," Jesse said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mike dialed Ferrola’s phone, which was always turned off, maybe she was on the plane now, a surprise without warning? Ferrola will do this. He thought like this, noticing that the office was quiet because of his arrival. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mike," a colleague patted him on the shoulder: "Go to the office of the director, someone is looking for you."<br /><br />&nbsp "Flyon Bureau?" Mike first thought of this, their harassment of the Lafayette Bureau is that until Vera Davis is no longer a member of the House of Representatives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not the FBI." Colleagues said that his eyes made Mike sit on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ominous premonition reached its zenith when Mike pushed the glass door of the director’s office - the director looked solemnly behind the desk, putting both hands On the table, ten fingers crossed, a pair of men and women sat opposite him, and when Mike walked in, they stood up, and the expression on his face made Mike feel very familiar for no reason - more than once, he and him The partner, who had also worn the dull, numb and irretrievable expression, knocked on the door of the victim’s family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t understand their self-introduction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mike Detective?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know a person named Ferrola. Famo."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," Mike's head 嗡嗡He was trying to stand firm and his voice drifted from a long distance: "I am her fiancé."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows what he will hear next . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They brought the death of Ferrola Famo, they said it was a pity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will give you a week off," said the director. Mike’s annual vacation is still sixty days: "Or more, Mike, take a good rest for a while." ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avery runs in the hallway, even on the court. He didn't run so fast, and the shouts of surprise and the curse of anger were thrown behind him in a flash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His roommates followed, but Avery didn’t run so fast, and Avery was not as strong. So he was caught by the students. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry..." He gasped and said, "Sorry..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" What happened?” A 12th grade student asked with enthusiasm: “He practiced charging in the hallway?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avery’s roommate hesitated He didn't know if he should say it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s Avery’s sister,” he said. “She was killed.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Chen Neike’s office door was pushed away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remember to knock on the door, child, remember to knock on the door," said Chennike, facing the door, saying that he was busy tapping the filter of the coffee maker with a small spoon. "Do not respect the teacher, you will be deducted credits, dear, this is a bad habit..." He turned the coffee cup and turned it around. When he saw Avery, he closed his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh..." After a few seconds he said: "Well, please come in, please come in... Tell me, what happened? You look so bad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has 12 years of service in Grande. The crying boy has never seen much, but it is a fifth-grade or sixth-grade student. When you are fourteen, the boys will become extraordinarily strong and faceless. In their eyes, tears are weak and incompetent. . The symbol of timidity, especially the existence of women and children, has nothing to do with them. They don’t even admit that they have ever cried unless you take out photos or videos - but when you break your arm or are beaten by your girlfriend . They occasionally cry, hiding in the toilet, sitting on the toilet and whispering tears, and when they are finished crying, they will remember to apply their eyes with a hot towel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Avery’s crying is like breaking twenty arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My sister is dead..." He sobbed and said: "She was killed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stainless steel morgue lies straight on Ferrola. Famo, her arms are tight against the body. The face, or the whole body, has not suffered any harm. The only, fatal wound is in the chest, under the left eye of the bull, right in front of the heart, there is a deep bullet hole, bullets running through the wound, small Caliber, the wounds it causes are not as embarrassing as large-caliber pistols, but the death they bring is the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a thin layer of cream on the bare gray skin. She is beautiful when she is alive, and still beautiful when she dies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last time she saw her parents was three years ago, the last time I saw my brother was three months ago, the last time I saw her fiance Mike was in Three days ago, but no matter how long they were separated, they are now equal and equal in the future. The young and beautiful life of Ferrola Famo has come to an abrupt end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just two o'clock the day before she and Mike agreed to meet, Ferrola’s agent called the police and claimed that they had armed robbery, the gangsters In an attempt to rape Ferrola, she rebelled against them and angered one of them. He fired at Ferrola and killed the poor girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, I specially brought a large cup of hot coffee to Mike, which added a lot of hot sugar and a little brandy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We will catch this group of bastards," he said vowedly: "Man, soon, I promise."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can I go and see?" Mike said: "It is the place where she was killed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is nothing to be kept secret, The place has been surrounded by reporters - "When the testimony is completed," he said: "I will inform you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you." Mike said gratefully . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the door of the board, Mike met Ferrola’s agent, Mike didn’t recognize him, and he recognized Mike. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
