			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Streif’s thoughts did not stay too much on Kemira and her paintings, perhaps this is stuck in the gap between the body and the soul. The small, tragic and sorrowful little animal does have some places to study and taste, but he can't find the desire to kill, kill or eat her – maybe there was ten years ago, but not now – to be precise, When Sasha was by his side, he never produced an appetite that was unusual or even horrible to others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghoul sticks a sharp, red tongue from his teeth, sniffing the various elements of the air like a snake, late The hibiscus tree flower, the courtyard seat of the travertine, the erosive smell of the deciduous leaves immersed in the rain, the runway and playground where rubber and asphalt are laid, and the rust of metal objects in the moist air. They are How close to the blood of human beings - and the smell of sweat mixed with Sasha, Streif did not follow the rules of the traffic, put the child in the back seat and then add Seat belt, he let Sasha sit in the front seat, covered with a small blanket, the child quickly smashed in a clean and warm car, the golden brown head was wet, and Streif occasionally saw his cheek drum. A small piece, that is, he unconsciously rubs his teeth with his tongue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The short nap ends in front of the Henry’s garage door. As we said earlier, the house that Streif bought does not have a garage. He must park the car. Elsewhere, Henry's home is one of the nearest neighbors to Streif, who are willing to provide a free parking space for their children's teachers. Every day, Streif stores the vehicles here, and then, along with Sasha, walks three miles back. Go to your own house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good evening." Mrs. Henry stood in front of her own rose flower from the front, and kindly and Stellaf and Sasha greeted her with plastic Gloves, black water pipes hang from her hips, clear water flowing from the inside, and accumulated on the lawn into a temporary small otter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good evening," said Streif, who was keenly aware of what it seems to be different from usual today, the two dogs of Henry’s family. Both dogs are hybrids and are said to be a mixture of Labrador and Bull Terriers. They subtly inherit all the inferiority of their parents, except for the huge body and the enthusiasm that humans can't afford - their hobbies are enthusiastic. Drilling into the crotch of every person I saw, screaming and screaming wildly, arching up, trying to carry them up and down again and again, and those poor guests would probably fall down on the porch or the grass if they didn’t Crazyly shouting out of the front yard of Henry's house... If it weren't for the ghouls that always had something to make them fearful, it would have been difficult for Streiff to escape from this embarrassing welcoming ceremony. - Even so, they will listen to and wait for the slight roar and brakes from the road in the driveway of Stroef's Chevrolet every afternoon, and rush out to meet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Henry soon discovered this, her lips stretched on her cheeks: "Are you looking for the two naughty children?" she said with a sigh of relief, apparently very happy that someone could miss the two colors like her. / The big dog of the madness and the madman complex: "They are squeezing the gland, God bless, finally find a veterinarian with a little skill, the previous few are always clumsy, make them call straight... you have to look It doesn't matter, I don't think they are too shy, you are an old friend," she giggled. "It's right next to the pool."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Streif blinked. He wrapped Sasha tighter. "Well," he said. "We will go and have a look."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;They almost smelled the stinky smell around a small bend, Streiff did not approach, the vet and the dog were on the other side of the pool, the veterinarian was very young, linen hair and chest The front beast pendant glowed in the setting sun, and he concentrated on observing a big dog. Ass/strand, one hand pulls its slender tail, and the other hand rhythmically squeezes the fur on both sides. Streif can hear him shouting: "One, two, one, two, One or two! Oh, well, it’s really good.” I don’t know if I’m praising myself or that ugly dog, but maybe it’s really good, because Streiff can see the pad on the napkin under the shit/strand. A lot of gray-yellow ochre secretions have been piled up, just like human nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Look, a big one." Mrs. Henry exclaimed. "The former veterinarian could not do this young man."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really." Streif said that he noticed the big dog's eyes, abdomen and tail and found that it was in a state of fear. Contrary to the previous, the former veterinarian always These two violent animals are scared in front of them. They don’t bite people, but if they dare to move their heads and tails, they have to be prepared to accept the collision and baptism of giant skulls. They also know how to bite people gently. The feet, drag them down and then drain them on their faces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, are you leaving?" said Mrs. Henry: "Maybe you are willing to stay for a while, will I introduce you to our new vet?" Say you have a group of bull terriers, you need a veterinarian, especially if you know how to deal with these little cute ones."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, you are right, "Streif politely replied: "But we already know, he is Hirenos Somitre. Indeed, he is very good at dealing with animals, I think I will contact him as soon as possible."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is really great," Mrs. Henry said. "In this case, I will not leave you - maybe I should go home early," she suddenly lowered her voice: "Mr. Streif, just now I am negligent, you see, I heard it on the radio. In the last two days, people only got a body from the river... It’s disgusting, there’s no head.” She said with anxiety: “It’s been special recently. Not too flat, poor Mr. Humbert, and this anonymous name - well, I didn't hear that Mr. disappeared, I hope he is not anyone I know. God bless you."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She draws a cross on her chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two ways to go home, Streiffs can Walk back on the sidewalks on both sides of the asphalt driveway, or you can choose to cross nearly one-fifth of the coastal wetland park. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was originally an ancient road in the wetland that could run through the entire park. The roadbed below was very solid with slate on it, but hundreds of years passed. Without constant maintenance, many places were sunk in the filthy ponds of the swamps. Later, the city refurbished the road. They carefully added the slip roads, set up road signs, and set up bridges in the sinking places. The original landscape of the ring wetland will not let people easily get lost or swamp in the inside. Many people are willing to walk inside often, while breathing the fresh air, while enjoying the tens of millions of trees, flowers, insects and animals in the wetlands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Study father and son will choose to cross this wetland in many cases, and here at some point they are very imaginative with the Amazon jungle where they have been away for several years. And sometimes the opposite is true, which makes them feel soothing and interesting. Streif often picks up berries while walking through the lush reeds, willows and bushes – growing on the dense peat moss community. Thick, high-impregnated blueberries, sometimes only one elbow, sometimes hundreds of feet long, the first fruit appeared at the end of May, peaked in the first few days of August, but can still be found at the end of September One or two of the fruity, fruity, fruity creams, they are not very sweet, with a strong sour taste, but the flesh is very thick, and Streif will add it to the beef, so the beef will become extraordinarily fresh and tender. Juice; there is another kind of blueberry that grows together with bilberry. It is much sweeter and much smaller than the previous relative. A large string hangs on the branches, and there are raspberries, black scorpions, and Unremarkable, no fragrance , But the fruit capsules full, very good taste, the problem is that you have to grab the bird and mouse before picking them down, a cluster of as many as a full three kilograms of Mao raspberries disappeared but is also a night thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are not many people in the wetlands at dusk, but today Strath seems to always meet unexpected people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Streif," Mr. Henry shouted happily, standing on the edge of a swamp, and the pumping machine banged loudly. His son is standing on the bridge and watching with enthusiasm: "Good evening."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good evening." Streiff replied politely. He stopped and looked around and found that Anne Kent’s grave was only fifty feet away from here: “What are you doing? Mr. Henry,” he asked calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A gentleman lost his watch here." Mr. Henry replied: "He is willing to pay 500 yuan for this commemorative gadget. So I got two pumps."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Isn't all the swamps here connected?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ; "No, not all," Mr. Henry pointed at the water that was falling rapidly. "This is not." The pump made a squeaking sound, and he suddenly lowered his head as if to jump, eyes For a moment, staring at the water, the mud was boiling, and he suddenly whistled. "We are lucky, Mr. Streif, we can add a dish to our dinner today." He put the glare of his own generator The searchlight pointed to one of the swamps: "Look at those little tails!" He shouted happily: "Squid! At least twenty!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I’m afraid of it,” said Streif. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Henry took the net bag and the processed long harpoon from the back of the pump: "Fortunately, I am prepared," he is dangerous between the branches and the roots. Jumping around and finally found a better position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long harpoon stabbed, the little tails swelled even more, but the harpoon was stuck, and Mr. Henry tried several times without success. His face became golden under the light, his face was oily and sweaty, "It was stuck!" he shouted. He stood up awkwardly from the branch and pulled out a pair of rubber gloves from his trouser pocket. This pair of gloves is very long, until his armpit, fluorescent yellow. He knelt down again. This time he gave up the harpoon, but directly put his arm into the mud, the pump was still working, and the writhing body of the squid flickered on the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
