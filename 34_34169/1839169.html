			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lilith caught Bonnie on the stairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She caught Bonnie’s ankle, which was suddenly lost as the Achilles, who was hit by the sun god Apollo’s deadly key Balanced, she hit the stairs down on the stairs, the knees and lips, the chin came a pain, the tongue also tasted sweet, the head squeaked, except for desperately breathing, nothing could be done - - Lilith climbed up along her ankles. Her body was soft, moist, and cold, and Bonnie couldn't stop thinking of a greasy, sticky dry grasshopper. She was playing in the woods behind her childhood. At that time, the disgusting thing did not know where it came out, stuck to her neck, just like the present feeling - the sucker moved lazily on the skin, creaking, her strength was sucked When he left, Bonnie’s limbs were weakly pulled over the hard, icy marble steps, motionless, and did not listen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Help!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie shouted, she thought she had exhausted her whole body The strength and the voice should also be very loud. In fact, the sound sounds like a baby cat who is not full-term. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have already said it," Lilith smiled and ate. She shrugged her nose and carefully searched for another place to go. The foot, the blood is more abundant, the spirit is more prosperous, her lips are close to the elastic skin and do not relax for a moment, which makes her voice sound very weird, but Bonnie can understand: "You always hinder me. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can't kill me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course I can't kill you," Lilith Sweetly said: "But I can ruin you, and you can't remember anything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lilith stroking Bonnie, Bonnie wants to vomit, She felt both fearful and disgusting. The lips found a good place and slammed hard. Bonnie heard a sly voice in her imagination. Her youth and vitality were sucked away. She was gradually becoming empty. Shell, and she can't do anything about it - she feels light and full of comfort... like drinking too much alcohol or sucking marijuana, her brain is changing Chaos, all the sounds, colors and things are mixed together, they stir and stir, finally stirred into a milky, soft, collapsed pile, smashing, high quality Carmen cheese; this is an opportunity No need to think, no compromise, no patience, she is the king of the world, she can do whatever she wants - she can even become happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In just a few seconds, Bonnie would slip and happily slide into the abyss of a black hole like a coma, like a person lying on the ice—if it’s not a bang and a new sharp The pain hits the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bullet rubbed her back of the head, pierced Lilith's shoulder and flew out of her back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tumbling bullets are stirring in the body, and now it is Lilith’s turn to scream, and even so, she can still firmly control the still-defying Bonnie, she took her prey with another arm that came in handy, and kept her in front of her... Her movements were not unpleasant, but she found the wrong barrier, and the people who shot did not care about the state. Nie, he fired a second shot. The bullet passed through Bonnie's arm and shot into the other side of her shoulder. Because she had lost some of her impact, this time the bullet failed to pass through Lilith's body - this is not counted. What's good news, the deformed bullet stuck in the flesh bones only caused more pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tearing injury made Bonnie awake, she struggled fiercely, and the two women fell down the stairs together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They slammed on the stairs for several laps before they stopped on the platform, Bonnie was pressed under the body by Lilith, one foot at a strange angle Stretched out to point to the ceiling, she broke, and the white bones pierced the skin - someone turned on the light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not the light in the big house, it’s white, bright, sharp, clear, everything is in its shape, the beam is moving, From the ceiling decorated with a gold-tone glass mirror to the wall covered with deep red velvet, then the black marble with silver dots, and finally fell to the two women's body - Gucci Huffner holds the gun in one hand The other hand carries the emergency light, and the light from the high-pressure sodium lamp has a high penetration. Whether it is Lilith or Bonnie, nothing can be seen except for the hot, sharp, golden light. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie gasps, she can't see, but her fingers can touch it - her feelings become very slow, but she can still detect her The body - getting old, the skin is slack, the muscles are soft, the hair is falling, she wants to talk, and as a result, the teeth begin to smash out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Help me." She grinned and cried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look what we found?" Hefner said coldly and tightly: "I am really surprised, Hopkins, although I am willing to believe in you, But before, I didn't expect anyone to be stupid enough to find a prey in this nearly sealed space. Once and again, she thought everyone else was as stupid as her?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not too stupid," Hopkins replied: "Maybe this has to blame you, Hefner. All the girls are strictly controlled by you, including your future wife, you are treated equally, she is restricted Going out, every time I travel, there will be more than half a dozen servants and drivers, bodyguards, and reporters who are pervasive. She has to hide hundreds of eyes and ears regardless of what she does outside. But in the big house, because You and your guests are extremely focused on the small secrets, here are outside the security, inside - at least as far as I can see, there are no monitoring probes in many places, no in the garden, no swimming pool, no terrace, room Not to mention, bodyguards and servants seldom stay in the big house. Only the silly little girls who can come and go here freely - they drink, smoke marijuana, steam sauna, hate each other, it is best Indifference - most importantly, the bunny here rotates frequently, and a large part of them will leave the mansion or even the entire rabbit business before the signs of aging - even if it is aging It’s faster, they and their doctors will only think that this is because of the smashing life in the past – she doesn’t have to worry about being trampled on the black tail... oh, maybe Bonnie. The exception is this, so she got special hospitality.” Hopkins’s gaze rested on Bonnie’s dry, messy white hair. "I regret that you have adopted this method. Mr. Hefner has a lot of ways to make her show her feet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bonnie, I don't care, I don't want to let the outside world intervene in this matter." Hefner said rudely, he raised his hand, the beam of the emergency light shook between Bonnie and Lilith, and the two women curled up in the corner, full Bloody, alive, a dying, they are solidified under the light, like a painting of the police. "You don't understand, Mr. Hopkins," he said in a loving voice: "I won't let her go to court, go to jail, that is too cruel to her. God testified, I love her, I used to want to She is married, I want to have a baby with her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, Hefner," Lilith sobbed and shouted: "Hefner..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have to say," Hefner’s voice suddenly became sharp and thin: "Before I connect Monica with you." "This is true." He lifted his gun and said: "Repent, Lilith. You have to thank God, I will give you a clean death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Wait!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give you five minutes, enough, Lilith! Pray, or I will kill you immediately!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait, no, Hefner, okay! God of hell! You give me a good listen, I have the right, have the right to do it!" Lilith suddenly amplified the sound, she staggered Her blood had stopped, and Hopkins reached out and put a hand on Hefner's shoulder, motioning him to pay attention to Lilith's shoulder. The shoulders are bare, the bullets are in a fleshy, and the vague flesh is creeping. The skin, fat, tissues, and muscles are constantly changing shape. It is like a chewing mouth. The metal warhead is pushed. Come out, the mouth is closed - in contrast, Lilith is getting old quickly, first the corners of her eyes, the corners of her mouth, and then the cheeks that are pulled down, the wrinkles accumulate on her cheekbones, the hair is tarnished, like the moldy mold Straw, the sedimentary stains are floating on the skin than on the surface... She twisted her body, as if she had to resist something, but finally she couldn’t help but bend her waist, and the long dry milk/room suddenly became loose. The clothes fell out of the neckline. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hefner observed her. He watched the whole process of change. The expression on his face became more and more weird: "Malena?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," Lilith, no, it should be Marlene, Gucci Hefner’s first wife, she showed a weird smile: "I am, Gucci Fna." She bent her dry fingers and pulled the collar: "It's me, your wife."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But...Monica, Mo Nika... How can you!!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why can't I, she came to me and ordered me to leave you, of course, at that time, I was still Lilith Mel - I am really naive, I proved her identity to her, I hope she can support me, but it turns out that Gucci Hefner, like you, is a ungrateful slogan - she refuses I am, I am also a monster! I am her mother, I was born to her, I am sick and hard to raise her, to fall for her disease, It was this little hybrid, she gave me a knife when we divorced, and gave me a knife ten years later! Happy, Hefner, she is just like you, her body is only flowing your blood. I can't find a little bit of my shadow on her!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So you killed her!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't." Marlena said calmly: "I just took back my own things, that is what I gave her, I have the right to get it back."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
