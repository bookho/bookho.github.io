			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little Hopkins went to see the fish first, except that the lips had traces of hooks, dark reddish-brown scales, slightly lighter The head and the serrated fins are almost intact, and the movements of the ankles are very weak, but as the administrator said, it is still alive, with large eyes and water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Four months ago, Dr. Hopkins sent a properly bandaged lamb leg from a high-latitude border area. The sheep there grew up eating wild leeks, and there was no strange smell. One and a half months ago, he sent about a quarter of a pound of fresh jasmine roots, which was real wasabi, not dyed. Green horseradish, wasabi is very demanding on the growing place, there are few places where large-scale planting can be carried out, mainly concentrated in the curved island circle on the edge of the eastern continent; and the Felicantu fishing port is far from the other end of the western continent - Anthony Hopkins once said that he may be very busy these years, and now it seems that this kind of busyness is far more than Sasha's original imagination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blue-green "barbecue" (the football field is full of vertical Line, like a barbecue shelf, so there is a number), Besib walked along the right side of the line, struggling to the goalpost, holding the ball that the quarterback passed to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has flashed five, six or seven or eight people in a row? Who knows, let them go to hell, his head is stuffy in the helmet, his hair is dry and wet, wet and dry, and the accumulated salt has to pickle his scalp, just like the fishermen pickled dried fish. In that way, he gasped with a big mouth, the small fence used to protect the cheeks and chin swayed under his eyelids, and a burly guy rushed from the side. He jumped up and raised his arm high, trying to catch the West. Bu, another guy copied it from the bread. The space they left for Besib was less than five inches. Besib heard the coach shouting, but he didn’t hear it clearly. His physical strength was almost exhausted. The only thing he could see was the end line that was only ten feet away from him. He suddenly speeded up, and an incredibly heavy body hit his back on his back. Both arms grabbed his neck and snatched the ball in his arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib fell down and moved forward. After a roll of inertia, the person on his body was shackled on the ground and became his mat. Besib stretched out his hands and forced the ball into the ground - they rolled into the scoring zone and the red team won. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white team members cursed loudly and pushed Besib down from the body, then he rolled over. Putting Besib underneath, the other players (whether the red team or the white team) ran over and rushed to press them underneath. Until the coach ran over, pull them one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finally pulled up Bishb and gave him a helmet. "Good job. Just do it!" the coach shouted: "Always keep In the national inter-school league, you will become the president!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s no wonder that he is so excited, Grande’s football team has a brilliant record. Tom Campbell, who was twice elected as the "Sports Sprint" champion, was elected "Professional Star Player" and "Most Valuable Player", was born in Grande. In 1988, he led the team in the national school. In the International League, Lien Chan won the game, and when they came back with the Golden Cup, the principal came out to meet. Also awarded bonuses to coaches and players. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Tom Campbell left, the situation of the Grand rugby team is not so good. They have not taken a trophy again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be some improvement in recent years. But there is still a lack of a "soul and general." Besib let him see hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishb didn’t seem to be able to show this kind of ingenious encouragement, a band with gloves and elbows was circled, like Ten minutes ago, he tightened his neck tightly, and the strength was like murder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person who lives in Besib is Avery, and he also took the helmet: "Pause, coach, can we leave for a while?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coach raised his hand and looked at the watch: "All rest for ten minutes," he said. "And then try the frontal collision line, let me see if you can hit a few times. "This sentence he said to Besib, he patted Besib's shoulder and returned the helmet to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishb reached out and wiped a face, maybe it was a long time boring in the relationship between the helmet and the protective gear, but he was whiter than the original," "What's the matter," he asked Avery. "What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Hopkins came to you." Avery said, along him The sight is smashing, and the boy with pale blond hair is waving his hand here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come to us." Besib corrected: "You and he know before me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avery smiled embarrassedly, "Yes I know, but I can't say that I am a friend." He thought about it: "At that time, of course, he has always been very good... You see, I was a little bastard who didn't understand things at the time. I used to have some time. I hate him very much, I hate it very much, and I have found a lot of trouble with a group of boys who think about me..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, but just now I am As you can see, you just fell in love with him." Besib said: "As far as I know, he should have no major changes compared with the past. What makes your opinion come to be one hundred and eight What about the ten-degree change?" He said: "This really makes me curious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avery wiped his sweat and hesitated for a while," ...he saved my life," he said gratefully. "In the first month or two, I couldn’t figure out what it was all about, and the adults didn’t seem to I am willing to listen to what I said at that time - I will hold my cry when I mention it - until they have a funeral for Alice, I mean, the girl who was thrown into the carp pond after being divided. Have you seen the news? Hopkins and I are also one of the hostages... When the man came in, he deceived us to release it instead of killing a child. I believe, is it stupid? Pukins pulled me, I opened his hand, if not...not that man can't see me, I am Alice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He took a long breath. "I used to want to thank him personally, but he and his father had left the 19th district before Alice's funeral. I also asked Mrs. Boro for their address. , mailing letters and small gifts, the result is 'check no such person' and return."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," Besib said: "You are here again. ", he has a pair of deep and bright eyes, the muscles on his face are not moving, even if Hopkin Doctor standing here. I’m afraid it’s hard to see at a glance what the child is thinking: “It’s really gratifying.” He said, he immediately whispered: “He also saved my life.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My father sent a very fresh star spot." Sasha said: "Two pounds."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To what extent is it fresh?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Also alive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Hopkins has considerable admirable skills in handling ingredients." Besib said: "Then I will not go." The canteen eats the pie."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They look at Avery, Avery’s face appears to be generally only in life and death. The painful struggle - Sasha Hopkins is a smart and meticulous person, these two are indispensable for those who are good at cooking, but in contrast, he also has a big shortcoming - That is the unique imagination of the Hopkins family. Little Hopkins, like an old aristocrat, never refuses and picks up the food that others send to him, but when he lets him do it himself, he always dismisses those ordinary sweet and bitter, he always I am trying to make a dish that surprises me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that there are very few dishes that can surprise Sasha Hopkins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ten dishes he made at least have the taste of it far beyond the tolerance of human taste. But there are also one or two that can make people unforgettable for a lifetime... I mean, positive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avery has been in the football team for several years, obesity and bloating have long since left him. But some things are always the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the stock is going forward, brave and fearless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishb and Sasha waited for his answer, and Avery couldn’t help but swallow the mouth when he thought of the wonderful taste, but he also came from The dishes of Sasha Hopkins’s hand trembled all night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...What are you going to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Slightly fried with cream, add Homemade sauce," Sasha said. “Plus roasted honey duck and salted bread.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“That’s it!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;——The sauce made by Hopkins is taken from freshly bitter gourd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avery pouted, and he looked at Hopkins’ eyes full of endless sadness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is going to cry," Besib said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Hopkins is now thousands of miles away, one Located in a small town on the edge of the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He bent slightly and examined the pile of grotesque things buried in the mud, like the cockroaches in the body, with the prudent eyes of doctors and ghouls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a kind of mushroom that is expensive and has a disgusting taste but is delicious and unimaginable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pine mushroom produced by Lu Kesheng. The townsmen are responsible for taking the trained dogs or pigs out of the soil at the roots of the broadleaf trees, and then trading directly with the truffle dealers after three or even four hands. These chubby truffles will appear in restaurants of three or more stars, and each serving (thousand thin slices, spread on bread or squid) can be sold for five hundred yuan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you can’t be completely sure that this precious ingredient is really true, and that it’s not adulterated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best way is to drive directly to here, you can walk into the restaurant here to call a golden can. Fluffy pine prawn baked eggs, delicious and delicious truffles like sesame seeds inside and outside the egg. Every bite can be eaten, and it's definitely worth the money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the owner is willing to do a little business, then it’s even better, you can buy truffles directly from him, the price is definitely better than the truffle traffickers. The price is expensive, but you can't take dozens of pounds like them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes sellers also move small hands and feet inside the truffles, not allowed to be cleaned of mud, small metal strips wrapped in truffles, etc., but Dr. Hopkins has a pair of precision-like hands, and his brain allows him to estimate the volume of the truffles when the scale shows the weight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two thousand dollars, can't be lower."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins nodded, Take out the check. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He simply wrapped the precious ingredients wrapped in dirty plastic bags in a newspaper, put them in the front compartment of the car, and locked them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
