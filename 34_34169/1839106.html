			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abel is as light and quick as a frightened snake: "I thought you knew, you can't use your companion." He sluggish The ground spits out each letter one by one from the teeth, because he had a splitting headache, and his ears screamed, and he had to take frequent breaths to reduce the adverse effects of sudden fear. Abel remembered that the organization gave the information that Catherine only had the ability to interpret the human and the residual emotions of the article, but now she is obviously able to force her feelings or thoughts to his body through physical contact. This taste is not so good, saying To be a little too far, this kind of behavior can be analogized to a kind of spiritual "forced deep communication." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, shooting your own companions is all right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They probably didn't think of a certain People are brave or stupid enough to face bullets. "Abel stupidly, he avoided the "companion", a word with special meaning, Catherine may have heard it, but she did not react, she still In a deep fear and uneasiness, she tried several times to look out and look at the situation outside, but she returned without success because of the bullets flying around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abel looks at this young girl, she looks like an active new corpse, pale, thin, dead... because the spirit is aggressed The raging fire of anger slightly lowered the temperature, and her fear of the "black ritual" was justifiable. After all, the "black ritual" seemed to be mad from Ariawu - before that, although his record had Twelve records of kidnapping and murder, but most of the members of the organization or the organization, only to get rid of and hurt, but since then, he has no scruples, almost every guy who is against him will be killed. It feels like a gate is opened... He quietly shifts his gaze to his wet trouser legs, where a greedy otter sways his head and looks for a place to sip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abel reached out and squeezed the leeches, then increased the force to smash it - a rough, uneven edge of the glass mirror between his fingers Forming, he lifts it to a suitable angle... The battle is nearing the end - although Abel is deeply confused by the sudden weakness of the "Black Sacrifice", the scene reflected in the mirror has clearly explained Everything - at least three bullets penetrated the priest's body, and one of the abilities who could turn a part of his body into a cold weapon had pierced his long knife into his shoulder, another different The capable person directed the sand to tie his feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——The Lord said to him, “Whoever kills Cain will be reported seven times.” The Lord gave Cain a sign so that no one would meet him. Just kill him. ——<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abel clenched the glass, and couldn’t care for the sharp corners of his hand, what was wrong with his vision? Or is the mirror transformed from the life of a otter reflecting the wrong image? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows he should do something, but he can't do it with one move - what kind of scene is this! He never thought that he would have the chance to see so many bullet holes at the same time - just like there are four other invisible gunmen who are following their actions in the action group: from top to bottom, from left to right They are all bullet holes, just like the bullets they use. The places they go in are small, the places they come out are big, and the blood is spattered in a radial pattern... If the bullet holes appear in the abdomen, knees, or chest, The victim may be able to struggle with a few snoring or convulsions, but if they occupy the forehead, temples and eye sockets, then the person who suffered this fatal injury is almost completely at the moment of the burst. It’s dead; there are a few deep wounds on the man whose hands are still in the state of long knife, just like a hidden person is waving a knife or an axe to try out those sharp edges on him. The clothes and skin suddenly opened, just like the rose in the hands of the magician, layer by layer, from shallow to deep, Abel’s good eyes allowed him to easily see the skin. Fat, tissue, muscle, tendons, bones and internal organs in protecting the ribs and pelvic bone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guy who was able to command the sand did not receive any attack, but he seemed to have been scared by this abrupt attack. He stood motionless, watching the priest gently shake his body and get rid of the two handles that have lost strength. Weapons with the target. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest turned around and the excess flesh on his face had fallen off, except for the dark, bloody stains that left no handsome gloomy face. What effect, like the previous stab wounds and gunshot wounds did not make his body dull and numb—his hands naturally hang down, pull open the placket, and pull out a folded sickle. Abel and Catherine are familiar with this sickle, because the people here use it to harvest lavender. This sickle is very sharp. There is a joke in the local area. When a foreigner harvests lavender here, he accidentally uses it. After a moment, he fell empty again, and he cut off his two calves. That was his only harvest at the Lavender Festival. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest stretches his arm, and the sickle opens, and the sharp blade illuminates more dazzling light than the diamond in the morning sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Hopkins adjusts the seat belt while straight The lift's windshield overlooks the ever-expanding olive groves of hundreds of meters. The helicopter's cabin is filled with two soft but bundled straight bodies. They are still alive, although their eyes are closed, their nostrils are open. It was very big, and the mouth spewed bubbles from time to time, and the sweat-soaked hair was messed up by the wind blowing in from the open cabin door. The ropes on them were not used to prevent them from resisting, but to determine the fixed shape of the body - Anthony fired anesthesia darts in the direction of 100 meters to ensure they were able to stay quiet for hours. . These anesthetic darts that are capable of overturning a zebra and the UHF liaison that lures the institution's helicopter to approach and even land him. The normative language of the institution and some internal conditions are among the doctors in the rainforest of Ariau. According to what he thinks is the "hunter" - as far as he knows, the institution should be regarded as a relatively new semi-official organization, but unfortunately it is also unresponsive and insensitive to some bureaucratic units, from his After leaving Ariau until now, they still have not changed their calling frequency and password. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His hands move in an orderly manner on the cycle lever and throttle pitch lever, the helicopter's horizontal rotor turns faster and faster, and finally the entire fuselage begins Slightly trembling, the amplitude of the tremor is getting bigger and bigger, the landing gear swayed off the ground, and the boulder used by the helicopter as a landing pad quickly became smaller in the driver's field of vision. Anthony's experience in driving a helicopter was not very rich. But he knows that it's time to skid. The helicopter slides into the air like a bird along the trajectory of the air. After the flight is normal, the doctor immediately pushes the circulation rod forward gently, and the plane begins to follow. The preset route climbed diagonally, and after reaching a height of 500 meters, he changed to a horizontal direct flight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He flew in the direction of the road hidden in the olive grove, against the rising sun, and Sasha was waiting for him there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha bends his fingers and grabs the monkey’s cognac hanging on his chest Ru room, ordered it to suppress the desire to scream, but its brown hair has fully expanded, which makes it look bigger than the original, this is only a history of nourishment, the domestication period is very short Mother monkey, Sasha chose it because of this reason, these monkeys are very accustomed to holding the monkeys to jump in the woods, even if they are in the bullet, they will not miss the "small monkey", and Vigilance is exceptionally high and temperament is exceptionally fierce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "hunter" that follows is a person who is good at camouflage, but even if it is disguised, it is aimed at humans, not animals, even if they can To a certain extent, the animal's eyes, nose and ears, but also the insects hidden under the soil and bark leaves, the insects are careful, rushing, although their mood is simple and small, but a large number, As long as you feel it carefully, you can clearly capture the uneasiness and anger of the hooligans in the air and the soil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The roar of the machine suddenly became louder. When everyone couldn’t pay attention, a black helicopter with the abbreviated letters of the yellow body “institution” was already very close to everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tracker standing on an olive tree stood up in surprise on the crossbar of the trunk: "Who called the helicopter?" The work has not finished yet. The criminals have not yet appeared, and the appearance of the helicopter may scare them away - he is waving his arms in the direction of the helicopter, hoping that its driver can understand what he meant to drive it away, so that the criminal who did not show up It may be mistaken for this helicopter to be a cruiser for the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His movements are too big, a big headless camouflage is peeling off like a paint on the wall, and Mr. Anthony Hopkins With the sharp vision of the eagle, he easily caught this strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The helicopter made a roundabout in the air and slammed into the waving arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Idiot!" The tracker shouted, "I didn't let you come over!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The side landing gear of the helicopter crashed into his chest accurately. It was a very violent blow. His tongue almost jumped out of his mouth, and his eyes completely protruded from the eyelids, blood from his nose. He squirted out of his ear. He was smashed out and flew for ten meters in the air before being caught by the branches. Later, people discovered that his entire chest was broken, skin, fat, ribs and internal organs. Mixed together, the broken bones passed through the muscles and skin of the back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another "hunter" was also exposed by the gust of wind brought by the helicopter - he clung to the branches, his eyes could not be opened, and the broken leaves were like The whip and the stone slammed on his face and body. In another roundabout, Dr. Hopkins took out the air rifle on his lap and put on a good bullet, aiming at the trembling ass. He emptied two rounds. However, in the third round, a small subcutaneous injection projectile flew out with a large dose of thiaropazine, plunged into his flesh, and the anesthetic quickly became effective. He was like a loss of control. The tree of force fell straight like that. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, not only these two, Anthony Hopkins thought, he observed the thick olive trees and the leaves and shrub layers in their roots. Soon, a trembling figure jumped out of the dark green and dark yellow ochre background, and then one again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing?" shouted the team member in charge of disguise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a snake!" The person who jumped out was frightened and annoyed. He walked down to the olive tree and sat down, tearing his trouser legs. Two dark red holes are clearly visible on the pale skin: "Help me." He wants to pull out the dagger and draw a cross, but he can't do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Impossible, there is no snake in this area!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But we have been bitten! Another person shouted, and he reached out and showed the pretender a round hole in his arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no need for him to explain more, because the people standing on the ground have already seen the reptiles that have swam to them. - There are white stripes on the black and brown background; the belly color is yellow and white, the elliptical head, and the head top scale has a pair of large pillow scales. The front of the body rises high and the head flexibly moves with people's movement. Turning around, the most striking feature comes from their screaming, expanding into a pocket-shaped neck, God, that is the King Cobra! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There should be no King Cobras here!" one shouted, but this was not an important thing. The members of the Action Group involuntarily jumped out of their original invisibility. One of them had a shotgun to the snake. The group fired a shot and stirred up the dust everywhere, but only hit one. It rolled on the ground, leaving a deep red mark, while constantly making a squeaking voice to show people its teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hit a ghost." One of them noticed that the snakes made an evasive action before the companion opened the gun: "They seem to know that we will shoot." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The helicopter once again passed over their heads, and the yellow-white flowers and leaves poured down on their heads like a rainstorm, accompanied by "ice" - - After the louder sounds and shadows, the two human bodies slipped out of the helicopter tilted to a certain angle and fell accurately between the olive tree and the olive tree. The action crews first stepped back and found that the two men were The pilot and the pilot of the helicopter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn, how can he kill two people at the same time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One guy shouted, He immediately smelled a sweet and eccentric taste. This taste does not come from olive trees or other natural objects. It is like an industrial spice extracted from oil or other dirty things. It smells. It seems very fragrant, but when it is too much, it is a bit pungent, people want to vomit, he sees the pale green fog coming out from the two bodies that descended from the sky, his eyes will be blurred, breathing difficulties Slow action, his body slid down, and the soul is rising, rising, rising... finally staying in a blank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Hopkins pays close attention to the situation below, and the light blue mist is like a ripple that is thrown into the water. With the spread out, the members of those action groups rushed wildly, but they fell down one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lowered the helicopter and hovered over the olive tree with a white spot. The helicopter’s downwind blew the fog around it, then sanded and The monkey saw a rope looped at the end and was thrown off the helicopter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rope is swaying in the air, but the monkey only tries once, grabs the end of the loop, and then it holds it firmly with one arm With Sasha, the other three claws clung to the rope and began to climb up in the violent shaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guy who controlled the sand fell in front of Abel - only half His lower body remained in front of the priest, and the remaining nerves let the two dusty ankles kick on the concrete road twice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Save me..." He screamed, clutching Abel's collar, Abel was in front of him, trying not to look at his other One hand, the hand is immersed in his own internal organs, grabbing this, and catching the one: "Stop the blood, give me a stoppage..." He stared at Abel's left shoulder position, there was nothing there, Abel knew He has been unable to focus accurately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest crossed the two legs that had stopped struggling and came to Abel here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abel whispered comfortably to the half of the person, his finger on the side of his neck, the heartbeat of this person was slower than once, he The knife was pulled out of the belt. It was a very small and narrow knife, but it was enough to cut the jumping carotid artery. He cut it, and the warm blood suddenly came out, but it was not described by others. It’s like a high-pressure faucet, probably because his blood is almost flowing – Abel thought he would die soon, actually not, the dying person stretched out his arm without hesitation, pulling himself out The knife hidden under the ribs pierced Abel's body with the final strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They hug so tightly that Abel can't open him for a while, but fortunately his ability can be used without a standard posture - the earth is rolling, rising, solid, and a fortress that is exchanged for human life. Quickly starting from Abel's body, he refused to take care of the pain and the nausea, and seized the opportunity to fire two shots outside, but I also know that the chances of these two guns hitting the target can be described as minimal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest’s face was gloomy. He thought about whether to let the two men chase the target, but finally decided to kill them – they saw too many things. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sharp sickle flies in the air, the priest uses it as skillfully as a diligent peasant, but it is not the plant but the human Life, the fortress of the earth was thinned by layers, and occasionally one or two bullets were fired inside the fort, but for the priest, this was just a little harassment that didn’t have to be careless. His last blow went to the entire fortress. At the top, Abel stood up from the inside, holding a gun in his hand and lying on the dead man at his feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the woman? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A human slammed on him from behind, one of her arms firmly stuck his neck, and the other arm was fitted Let it tighten tighter, the priest waved a sickle in anger, let the sharp blade pass through her body, perhaps the waist, maybe the ribs, she screamed, then bite him in a slap On the back of the head, a lot of emotions are conveyed through close contact - humiliation, anger, pain... the most fascinating priests and the joy of ** - the debauchery of a woman, like countless dips The tip of the spear with honey was stirred up in his internal organs, and he almost had to grab his stomach so that the filthy things flowed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine tried her best to stick to the priest, as if a peer had seen the last man in the world, she didn’t know that there was no Sasha as a conductor. It’s useless, but she can only fight it. When Abel draws the priest’s attention, they will both die. Fortunately, she succeeded. The priest's body softened and the sickle fell to the ground. She immediately wrapped her thighs and conveyed her emotions again and again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She didn’t know when she finally got rid of her hands and feet. She only remembered that she had mistakenly attacked Abel. The expression on his face was extremely strange. Even Catherine, who is unconscious, remembers the moment clearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Hopkins hovered the helicopter above the olive tree Closely watching the monkey carrying the sand climbing up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The helicopter produces a large whirlwind, and the rope is swaying. If it is a personal class, it is impossible to straighten up the climb in the case of holding the child in one hand. But the monkey is different. It has two other hands that can be used interchangeably. It is very fast. In a few minutes, the doctor can already see the face of Sasha. His sharp eyes can be sure that the sand is lighter than before. At least 80 grams, but less than a centimeter, the hair was cut, otherwise it should now be over the shoulder, wearing a rough look, low-grade clothes, but like her mother, Even if she uses the cosmetics used by more than 50% of the crowd or the clothes of the same size, she still looks outstanding, especially, it is worthy of appreciation, protection and cherished existence... However, Before going to the custom clothing store, she still needs to go to the hospital to do the most detailed examination. Whether her body is as healthy as ever is a big problem, and Anthony Hopkins must also determine her body. No tracking equipment was installed on it - then, she needed a good rest, and then An An heartedly ate a meal, all of which had been arranged before the doctor arrived in the town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
