			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Boa opened his eyes, he found that the sun in front of him narrowed, and it was very weak, and it looked like it was going to disappear - he realized that he I was in a coma for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There should be only feet in his injured area, but he feels swollen and painful all over the body. He tried to move the two legs - before they were like Nothing like this, this action caused a sharp tingling, like a charcoal fire that was stuffed into a bucket of red crickets, and he screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah," his mother said, her voice was far away from him, very slight, like a bee shaking its wings in a can. "It's not too late." "Boa, hurry up, put on socks, and shoes." She said in a logical way: "We should go back. I have a small party tonight." She paused: "Your father also has a critical Dating - we are all rushing to let go of our own things - God bless, this is the last time, otherwise I will smoke you, squatting, and be stricter than your father - what's wrong, why not stand Get up?” The same wet thing was attached to Boa’s scarred face. The water flowed into the skin that was cut off by the floor debris. Boa struggled to escape. His eyes were red and swollen because of crying. A small gap, from the gap, he saw his mother, her makeup is meticulous, the color is gorgeous, it must be traced again - she used to be like this at home, make up every hour, two Change it to three hours Clothes, she never hold BoA, will not allow him near himself, because ignorance of the children would take her clothes crumpled or dirty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baoer tried it, he couldn’t stand up, he looked up hard, Ferguson Douglas leaned against the window, and he took a leisurely look A sleek cigar, his mother was withdrawing his hand from him, and she threw the soiled handkerchief on the floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that it is impossible to get even the slightest help from these two people. But he did not have the strength. When he wanted to stand up, the red and swollen soles of the feet were like stepping on the iron that was burning. He is now grateful to the throat that has become hoarse and dark after crying loudly. Who knows if Douglas’s patriarch will continue to beat him with “screaming too ugly”? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you think he needs to see a doctor?" Mrs. Douglas asked, since she saw that Boa’s manners had "crawled" into the bathroom, that The two thin eyebrows didn't stretch any more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The kid knows what to do." Dr. Douglas said indifferently: "And, the ability of the abilities to recover is very strong - before the age of 25, except for women and cigarettes, alcohol, and money, I am the biggest. The hobby is Ossian, no matter how embarrassing today. Tomorrow he can walk out of the room with breakfast and a pretty little white face - this big fool, he still hides and hides, does not want me to know that he has ......" He frowned, as if he didn't know which word to choose: "That little skill..." Foggs said rather reluctantly: "Does he think that I will be crazy about it? It's ridiculous, isn't it?" He shrugged his shoulders: "He just kept his little secret. It's very interesting. I have deliberately slammed into his room several times without knowing how to say hello - ha, dear. You I know, the last time he hid a pot of cactus that had been twisted and twisted into the crotch. I stood there and dragged him for half an hour. His face was blue..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look He did not suffer too much impact. "Mrs. Douglas said pointedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is perhaps the only place where people can make people feel excited," Mr. Douglas whispered. "But it's nothing, you know..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...What do you want to know?" With a keen sixth sense of women. Mrs. Douglas caught the word, and she had a hunch that it would be something that deserved her great interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, I am sorry... I forgot." Mr. Douglas showed a bad smile: "Little mixed ball. Are you ready?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Douglas twisted her body, her son stood at the door of the bathroom, half of the body was soaked, dripping down, but his feet looked much better. It is. He put his shoes and socks in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have to do it right with us?" Mrs. Douglas said indifferently: "How many times do you want me to put on socks? Then shoes." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baoer glanced at her and sat down on the ground, wearing socks and shoes on the cold, damp ground - his entire face was distorted. The soaked water socks were exceptionally tight, and there were shoes. His fingers trembled almost without catching the laces—his parents waited patiently, they switched topics, started chatting, and Boa listened, He hopes to find something that will divert attention from the inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They talked about "travel", "island" and "music". It seems that it is going to be a holiday. Boa ridiculously provokes the corner of his mouth. It’s really rare to see the couple willing to do so when not necessary. Amphibious flying. "Hey~" His attention was too concentrated. A wrong hand, the tight socks bounced on the hot flesh. After a brief cool, it was an unbearable pain. Boa bent down and hugged his feet. Open your mouth and take a deep breath - this is what Miss Marcia taught him. When you are injured in sports, you can use this method to reduce the pain. He shakes a lot and starts to wear his socks and shoes in a few minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he puts on his shoes and socks, he takes care of himself according to his mother’s request... at least it’s not so bad, then he can follow his parents. , limping out the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How about this exam?" Mrs. Douglas asked unintentionally: "What do you think you can do?" She is like an ordinary The mother with vanity made the promise: "If all a, we will bring you this time, you will like it," she sneered: "No, not an island, I believe that the small island you conquered is enough. Wearing a necklace, you will see a real beauty - both chest and hip, the skin is as white and shiny as the pearl, and the sound, her voice seems to cut your heart directly - - Penetrate your body and make you goose bumps - it's hard to describe, you will forget everything... Dear, that's a natural stunner - you have to learn well with your dad, just like a flat It’s the ass that hasn’t existed, and it’s too much to lose the face of the Douglas family.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Can’t you say two ass?” Fergus Douglas Said, "How can this damn elevator not come?"<br /><br />&nbsp;& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Patience, dear," Mrs. Douglas said leisurely. "Speaking, we are all derelict. Anyway, we should have discovered that our lovely Boa has moved the heart of spring." At least, can you recommend him a hip that is still too good?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Douglas turned his head annoyedly, he did not notice that the elevator door was open, one The man rushed out from inside, and Mr. Douglas showed agility that was completely inconsistent with his figure. He avoided, and Mrs. Douglas was earlier than him. Only the inconvenient Boa blocked his way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boa was knocked open and hit a long distance. His back hit the vase shelf at the door, and the large vase of bronze inlaid was crumbling, but fortunately the woman who came out of the wickedness had reacted quickly enough – she caught it. At that time, the vase was only a few inches from the head of Boa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, sorry." Catherine said, "Are you okay?" She kept her holding the vase and looked down at the boy. The injury on the boy’s face made her exclaim, but she immediately realized that it was impossible. It was knocked out. "What happened to you? What happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bao raises his head, he recognizes this woman, she is also a versatile, that is, Ferguson. What Douglas said, playing tricks, is said to have the ability to see other people's memories - fortunately the Douglas couple came very fast. They don't allow her to get close to Boa, or Boa doesn't know if she will find out what she is doing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately endured the pain and wanted to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait..." Catherine shouted, and she dropped the vase. Grabbing the boy's arm - fear, horror, pain... fell down with a sigh of relief, she let out her hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Douglas pulled over Boa and held him in his arms. "What do you want to do?" She disgustedly suppressed her voice: "You want to be with me." What is the son doing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay. Stop your mouth." Mr. Douglas scanned his two men in the elevator with his yellow eyes. A suit is pretty. A burly figure looks quite a bit like: "Please come out, gentlemen," he said. "This is not the place to give you a hybrid dance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;When they came out, Foggs Douglas, one by one, violently plunged Boa and his mother into the elevator. He raised a finger and pressed hard with a depressed and contemptuous attitude. Close the button. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine was stopped by the "head" and Abel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..." she said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is nothing." "Head" waited until the elevator door was completely closed before putting the arm down: "Nothing."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But that is abuse!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go back to the room." Abel held her shoulders helplessly, forcing her Turn around: "Catherine,."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
