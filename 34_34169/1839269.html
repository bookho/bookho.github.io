			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter 187 over(1)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Enough!" Catherine Point Cried, she couldn't see it, and the sound she heard was very vague, but the outside world continued to pass in, and the negative emotions that gradually increased could tell her everything. She grabbed the meatballs at hand and shivered a little bit to belong to her. The power - Sasha loves this friend very much, she does not want to hurt him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meatballs were stagnant for a moment, then they were like a few dissatisfied drums, and Catherine was like a piece of chewing beef.吐 地 地 , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , The masterpiece of an insane abstract painter can be imagined in the deepest nightmare, and her silk clothing that leaves fingerprints without touching the gloves has become one of many irreparable victims. Catherine and Don't care about this, she was thrown on the carpet, the force is not heavy and not too light, her back hit a table, Catherine grabbed it and stood up, suddenly returned from the darkness to the light, her vision Not very clear, but she can easily find Sasha and Besib, the entire casino, to be precise, in the abattoir, only the flow around Hopkins and the two boys is stable ... and cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Stop immediately," Catherine said. "Bishb. Bissand, take yours..." She will not find an adjective for a while: "put Your ability...take back!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not my decision, dear aunt, Besib said in his heart - accurate and timely The ground block intercepts bullets that are less than an inch away and the speed reaches nearly a thousand feet per second, and then re-captures them back at the same speed... Chegaler. Bu. It takes more time than Sangdi. For a long time, the starring horror film is not Besib. It is Sasha Hopkins. Of course, Besib does not think that he said this, Catherine will believe. The time he spent with Catherine was really not long, but it was enough to let him know how a paranoid and simple nerve of this blond-blue-eyed beauty. In general, the men of Poseidon Island will use a bullet to restore everything to normal. The problem is that Catherine is the aunt of Sasha, the only blood relative, (and she is also the little sister of Big Hopkins, but don’t Bu thinks this is negligible). Sasha may not love her so much, but this does not mean that he will happily watch her die, the person who killed her is still her own friend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meatballs around Besib split a tentacle. When I licked my own hair, then he really couldn’t understand what the woman was thinking. Is she sad for that person? The devil testified, here. Only the garbage that wants to kill them and take their lives to gamble, maybe there are one or two pure and innocent lambs - Besib can only say that their luck is too bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Catherine," Sasha said, the light hanging from the top of his head was covered by his flesh-colored film, and the place where he was dark was like It is a cave. Catherine thought she was wrong - only then, she thought she was seeing Big Hopkins, and the eyes were red. But then she found herself wrong. She was standing by Sasha Hopkins, not his ghoul father. His eyes were still dark purple, and the lack of light was similar to black: "You How is it feeling?" His voice suddenly became extremely hoarse and low. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am fine." Catherine observed the situation around, from now on. The film evades a small space, they are like being quilted in a balloon. "Can you let your friends stop? Sasha, let me come, I think I can control... Hey, this situation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha did not speak He licked Besib around him, and Besib blinked at him. He felt that Sasha was withdrawing his strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, come over," Sasha said, "Aunt."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine seems to be What confuses, without hesitating to grasp the hand that Sasha has extended to her, the film like a protective cover is quickly removed, split in the air, and then twisted into a bundle, similar to a thick rope or cable. "Things", retracted from the original position in the weird buzzing sounds - Besib's chest, back, limbs and hands and feet, Besib gently vomited, he was the first time so long The ground, the violent and determined use of this power that is not human, his heart is not as calm and waveless as his appearance, and several times, he almost could not control it - Sasha has speculated about this if One day, his power finally broke through the imprisonment of reason and thought and succeeded in taking the upper hand. The biggest possibility is to eat everything that feels like it can be eaten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bessib never thinks that waking up with his own friends in the belly will be a good thing to make people feel good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Control is more difficult than indulgence. Besib made several deep breaths to dispel the exhaustion from the depths of the body and the brain. A few drops of water hit his face, and the son of the thug leader looked up in surprise and hidden in the sky. The fire sprinkler faucet was spraying down, and the last few tentacles dropped the lighter and slid across the ground into the pants of Besib. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine’s power is invisible, silent, colorless, tasteless and omnipresent, but it requires media, the air becomes damp, and the carpet is quickly plunged into the water. Like a baby's breathing, the turm of the baby penetrated into people's clothes and skin with the spread of water vapor. At first it was not conspicuous, but it didn't take long for it to occupy people's minds like fiercely breeding bacteria. Their Thinking becomes dull and the movements become slow. Some people (especially the wounded) fall down, and they start to sleep, and some people with stronger willpower become stupid. Looking at each other with expression, not talking, not doing action, but for a minute or two, the casino full of screams and crying was caught in the silence of the cemetery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are still six people who can stay awake, Catherine, Besib, Hopkins and Son, and Ivan and Ivan’s brunette companions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Hopkins is not keen on guns, but it does not mean that he is not good at using guns, he can easily fly to Iraq. Wan's skull - the revolver with the walnut handle, the position of the bullet will cause the gun's center of gravity to change extremely subtly, ordinary people can't feel it, but this is not a problem for a bit of experienced abilities - - The reason why he did not pull the trigger was because he saw something that made him interested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look at my baby." Ivan said that his thumb is clinging to something like a lighter, of course it is not a lighter, don’t I guess that stuff can send the whole "Tianqiu" to heaven: "That," Ivan squatted tightly on the neck of the black-haired female companion: "And this, I know that you are here for her." Shaking his arm: "Let them see what you really look like, they will be fascinated by it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brunette woman wept so sharply, Her bare skin suddenly gave birth to an amazing number of red rashes at a rate visible to the naked eye - the rash grew up, bulged, became a pustule, split, and there was a translucent tissue fluid inside, something in it The inside turned, the cracks widened, and they saw something like that - it was an eye, exactly the same as a normal eye, the sclera, the iris, the cornea, the pupil, and there were hundreds of them who hurriedly turned around. Turn around, look around, transparent mucus flows down like tears Non-stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
