			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought you would go back to the room first." Besib said that he consumed a lot of champagne and beer today, maybe a little anise, anise Or their team doctors brought Bai Yancheng in the name of drugs, and beer was the private possession of a certain player. Fortunately, they were not discovered, or they found out that they were silently raised because they were outsiders. Let go, anyway, this game is also very important for Bai Yancheng - the observers in Aleutian are watching their every move, even if they pay the equivalent of twice the tax of other cities, the state There are still many people who are dissatisfied with the autism and loneliness of Baiyancheng. They are bent on opening up the heavy barriers that the saints and elders of the sects have painstakingly set up for five hundred years, tearing the mask, opening the box and letting the inside Come out and let the outside go in - this kind of thought and voice is so sharp and sharp that the current saint Jared also had to give up a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rugby competition is one of them. They have to make it successful, so as to create a happy and healthy scene, those members will Feel happy, maybe a little more... a sense of accomplishment? It’s not easy to make a hole in the solid defense of Baiyancheng. God promises that this score will not be too ugly even if it is written in the nomination sheet during the presidential election. The monks and nuns of the supervising sects are The Western Continent’s religious system is only 2% of the religious system, but it is long enough to reach the end, and the influence is far enough. Even the East Continent, which has always been cautious about religion, has its followers, and the number is not less than the Western Continent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is enough to be coveted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We still live in a room tonight." Bai Yancheng is really passionate about them, a whole new small hotel, all Rand's, there is room for one person per room, and every moment, young men with white shirts and black trousers walk around the corridor. They are waiters. Basically, they can be satisfied as long as they do not violate the requirements of the supervisory sect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, yours, or mine?" Besib paused and lazily twisted his neck. "Where do you have coffee and tea?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is coffee." Coffee and tea are also taboos of the Superintendent, and Besib is not the kind of person who will remember to carry these gadgets, and the hotel room. In the refrigerators and supermarkets, there are only mineral water, juice, chocolate and milk in the supermarket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha only has coffee powder, and Bai Yancheng does not sell coffee. Of course, coffee bean grinders will not be provided. These are new beans from Panema, which are vacuumed immediately after grinding. Avoid contact with air and affect the fragrance and taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How much sugar do you want to add?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are really good here," Besib Say: "There is still a kitchen." Sasha bent down, took out the lemon from the refrigerator, and took out a glass teapot from the floor cabinet, "Greek coffee?" and this sometimes critical and demanding friend It’s been a long time. Rough is like a stone that has just been split from the mountain. Besib has mastered a lot of knowledge about this or what: "Give me three times more sugar, and not lemon peel." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Really, compared to other people, especially Besib can be said to be a small room to open the door, the room in Sasha is really a bit Luxury, meeting area, study and kitchen. The bedroom has a shower and bath in the bathroom, and a beautiful silk carpet hangs around. The pictures on the silk carpet are related to the Bible story. On the silk painting hanging on the wall of the bed, the shepherd is watching a group of white lambs. The golden sunlight shines from above, and a circle forms behind his head. With a burr of aperture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The calm brown-haired middle-aged man holds the scepter in one hand. With one hand extended, the lamb is holding his hand. There is something in that hand. But not grass: "What are they eating?" he asked casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is salt." Sasha said that the coffee powder that had been ground like flour was boiling in a transparent pot, and he deliberately put a little more coffee. Powder, the fragrant liquid is black and viscous, and when you pour them into a cup, it is like a hot, bubbled mud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The area where Baiyan City is located is an extremely barren and hot barren land five hundred years ago. The mountain is bare, there is no wood, and there are red and yellow ochre everywhere. The dry dust, no one cares and cares about it, and for this reason, the original supervising sects can stand here. They have had a lot of hardships in the past ten years, until the saint Jared has once again received an angel. Revelation - He took his followers out and pointed to the water that was pouring out of hell, bitter and salty, neither for humans and livestock, nor for irrigating wheat and vegetables. Say: "This is the blessing that the Lord has given us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is brine, although it can not drink, it can be salted, and it is still a good quality salt. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salt therefore occupies a very important position in the supervision sect. When the monks of the superintendent sect held the mass, the holy communion of the people involved in the mass was not only bread, wine, but salt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you." Besib took the coffee. Greek coffee is not filtered. Even if it has been placed for two or three minutes, the liquid still has some fineness. The dust, the coffee with three times the sugar, is sweet and rough, quite close to the taste of Sibu. Sasha cuts a half of the lemon, smears the lemon peel along the mouth of the cup, then gently twists the lemon slices. Wait until the dripping juice mixes with the coffee foam, and then throw the lemon slices into the cup. This is the authentic practice of Greek coffee, but Besib does not like sour drinks. The sour taste of coffee can only be said to endure. Within the scope, but really no need more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really good," although there is no lemon, but Besib still smells the wonderful smell of lemon fresh fruit and rich coffee aroma. "We can still be a divination." With the stomach and tongue that transcends ordinary people, he quickly drank the coffee and turned the cup upside down on the plate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Better not," Sasha said indifferently: "I don't think it will be a good result."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's see?" Besib mentioned the cup: "What do you think is this? A flower?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha twisted Twisted eyebrows, he sat face to face with Besib, Besib looked like a flower, he looked like a black sheep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and 90% of skyscrapers built in the first century The three-story building occupied by the Grande has a powerful ventilation system that looks superfluous. The well-connected pipes are like a spider web that is densely covered on the ceiling and in the wall, and the air outlet is placed in an inconspicuous place. Fresh air is sent to the room. There is always a slight rose in the air - the air handling equipment is installed in the ventilation system, connected by pipes, and the plant essential oil that is atomized in the equipment is spread to each room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aluminum can of the plant essential oil replenisher was pumped out and replaced by a jar of salted water, also holy water. Elder John stood next to the machine, his left hand sleeves rolled up, a monk cleaned his entire arm with holy water, and his right hand held a silver knife that was also washed by holy water. After being signaled, he would left the left hand. Point your finger at the aluminum can with holy water. The knife in the right hand cut the wrist of the other hand. The silver knife was very sharp, and only a narrow but three-inch wound was pulled out. Elder John immediately put together five fingers, letting his blood flow down the shape of the palm of his hand, dropping into the aluminum can along his fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air suddenly filled with a rose, very strong, but like the real rose. This aroma is not too irritating and it feels irritating, it is a fascinating and infatuating smell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are people in addition to John Elder, Heyman. Strong, and four monks, two of whom are similar to John Elder. Although they had already drunk the holy water with John Elder's blood as a precaution, they still couldn't stand the temptation - they couldn't help but take a few deep breaths, and the tiny, almost incapable particles entered the lungs from their noses. . Being carried by the blood and spreading to the whole body, they will feel light and fluttering, their feet can't grasp the ground, and the back is hot. It seems that wings have grown and bright white rays shrouded them. The gates of heaven are open, and the sages of the ages, Jared and the angels, come to greet them with a smile, sweet songs and sweet tastes immersed in the whole body...they sway their heads, arms and knees, their muscles are soft, eyes Closing, like a bit of a soaked flour pocket, fell down and slammed into the hard concrete floor, making a loud noise, but the other four people present, Hayman, didn’t move. There was no order, and John and the other two younger monks (they were also the brothers of Heyman) did not move and did not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hayman stood up straight, with no expression, his eyes filled with cruelty and indifference beyond humanity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not strong enough." He said softly, holding up one hand and stopping the monks who wanted to dress up for John Elder: "These Not enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elder John gave him a slight sigh, and he did not hesitate to cut the wound that had stopped bleeding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood flows into the jar, the machine works slyly, and a mixture of blood and holy water, like a rose, is sent to each room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why, is there a problem?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." Anthony Hopkins said, standing up, "but I have to leave."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But the results have not yet come out." The doctor at Baiyancheng stood up and said: "If you feel a little tired, we have a lounge here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
