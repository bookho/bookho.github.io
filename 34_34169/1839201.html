			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poly caused only a slight bruise on the muscle epidermis, but for the sake of safety, Dr. Douglas did a full check for him— - The school hospital's equipment can almost diagnose various diseases or conditions that require short-term treatment. The treatment room is fully equipped. Half an hour later, the assistant doctor brought a small Hopkins x-ray, and Doctor Douglas clipped it to the film. On the stage, the light source is turned on, and the film on the black bottom shows a strip of translucent white ribs, no cracks, no shrinkage, neatly arranged. "You have the most beautiful ribs in the world," Dr. Douglas said. "It's okay, Don't worry," he added softly. "They are all good. They are not damaged. As for those bruises, I will give you ice first. When you are hot in twenty-four hours, you may feel a little pain tonight..." The doctor smiled slightly: "If you can't sleep, you can drink some tea." He stood up, went to the front of a cabinet with many drawers, counted the labels above, and looked for a few points carefully. After the clock, pull one of them and take out the three small gauze tea bags. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha took a pill and curiously sniffed, "Rose and Dendrobium,"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Very correct, bring it back, ask the administrator to burn a pot of boiling water, soak them up and drink when you are warm." The doctor said: "Your age is not suitable for tranquilizers and pills. They can Give you a good dream."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But if you feel pain or fever, come to me immediately," he said last. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boa did not go too far, he looked at Sasha. Pukins walked into the white building and then came out. After a while, he also walked in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is not closed, Dr. Douglas is doing medical records, he is on the desk, frowning. The attitude was serious and serious, and the pen with a pen tip rustled on the pale yellow paper. Boa stood at the door for a while and found that nobody cares about him for a while, and put on a look of nothing to do. In front of the black drawer, he carried his hands and fingers groped in the drawer. The cabinet was as tall as an adult and as wide as two adults. There are thirty floors in total, each with twenty drawers, and the labels on them are all ancient Latin. In addition to the scholars who specialize in the ancient Bible and the doctor Douglas himself, probably no one can understand it - Boa is not necessary, he has already made a mark on the beloved drawer - the drawer is a wooden handle, he used The key has a mark on the inside of the handle, which can't be seen, but it can be touched with a touch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't look for it." Dr. Douglas said without lifting his head: "I did a little bit of finishing the previous two days, rearranging the order, my dear scorpion, you can pull the drawers, find them one by one, or look at the above. Label."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Boa spit on his mouth. Touching the ground and closing the drawer that has been opened halfway, he was caught on the spot with no sense of embarrassment and guilt, but full of resentment and dissatisfaction. "I'm a little uncomfortable," he said arrogantly. "I want a tea bag."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Speak first." Dr. Douglas made a good record Temporarily into the drawer of the desk with the pen. "Isn't you comfortable?" He raised his arm, his fingers were tied into a tower, and his index finger was against his lips. He is 36 years old and is a charming and beautiful man. Black hair, gray-green eyes are very charming, but always blocked behind the thin-frame glasses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Boa took a look at him and walked slowly to his desk, suddenly reaching out and sweeping all the things up to navy and dark green It was the king's French plaque on the graphic carpet, then he climbed up and sat on it, and the two bare legs swayed on the edge of the desk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are a idiot idiot." The child said arrogantly and rudely: "I don't have any place to be uncomfortable. If I really want to say it, it is my heart." Very. How about the little ghost who just checked for you? Have you broken a few ribs?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you have one, then you will be unlucky." Dr. Douglas said with patience: "I don't think my brother and nephew can tolerate you to this point, Boa, you are a smart child, you should understand where their bottom line is."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It was just an accident." Boa argued that he knew it well, and Dr. Douglas said it was right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boa’s parents divorced when he was very young. Unlike most parents, they are more loved by the children than before they divorced – Both intrinsic and outward, Boa Douglas is a child who is not inferior to Sasha Hopkins. His hair is black, his hair is small, his skin is pale and smooth, these two are the same as his father; and the slender limbs, slender body and slightly transparent texture of pale blue iris and slender eyelashes are with his Mothers are no different. His favorite and talented swimming and ancient literature happens to be the hobby shared by them. The couple regard this child as the only thing that can continue their existence. They care for him, touch him, kiss him. Pampering him is like cherishing another. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intelligent and sensitive Boa immediately seized this point. He stepped through his parents and used any opportunity he could use to stimulate them and force them to love him in a game. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is not a requirement for parents, and their position is quite consistent in some respects - Boa. Douglas is the best, no doubt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Masia praised him." Boa grabbed his hair in annoyance, his hair was still wet, and water was dripping on the carpet and desk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss Marcia has to praise half a dozen children every day," Dr. Douglas said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's not the same," Boa yelled angrily: "He... threatens me!" He rubbed his teeth fiercely, like Sasha Hopkins was biting in his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Uh huh." Dr. Douglas showed a disturbing smile: "So, a real enemy." His tone said briskly: "Really, The child...maybe, his eyes are as fascinating as the purple tourmaline. It is said that his second language is also Latin. How is his performance in the quiz? It should be good, because the teachers I met are very fond of. He." He asked his nephew with great interest: "Do you think I should collect him? He looks quite quiet and tastes great, maybe he will like my community."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will dig out his eyes first," Boa said scornfully, jumping off the table and swaying out to the door. The things that he had thrown on the carpet were kicked everywhere. All. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Boa?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With this." Dr. Douglas threw a small bag, Boa caught it, and he quickly sent it to his nose and smelled it. This is exactly what he wants, "Oh," he said with a satisfied look: "Thank you, uncle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was the first time since he entered the door The performance is not so annoying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have to learn to adjust your mood," Dr. Douglas said. "There are several herbs in it, two or three of which are difficult to grow and difficult to handle. It’s not easy to mix, it’s the winner’s prize,” he said slowly, pointing out the window: “such as Sasha Hopkins.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Boa rushed out of the door. Almost hit Jane, she is an assistant doctor at the Grand Boarding School, and is also the right arm of Dr. Douglas - she holds a big hand in her hands. The erect mother-in-law, which is sun-dried, is considered a symbol of “sound” in the church calendar, and is used to worship the bishop of Jerusalem in the first century, St. Jimon, who is Jesus Christ. Cousins ​​- can cure colds, coughs and dermatitis after drying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Give it to me." Dr. Douglas said with emotion, he used his fingers to pick up the dark green leaves. Gently squeak and listen to them squeaking: "Good boy, good boy," he praised, and the feelings contained therein were much richer than when he faced Boa or Sasha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Violet is also very good," Jane said. "The last batch of violets in this spring."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Let me go and see." Dr. Douglas said, "Look at the situation, we may be able to harvest them all in the morning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Grand School has always been generous to talented people. Regardless of whether the person is a teacher or a student, just as they are willing to spend tens of thousands of dollars to clean up a river course for a proposal from Marcia, there is a small hobby of doctors, pharmacists, health educators and many other practicing qualifications of Douglas doctors. Nature can also be satisfied. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Douglas has a garden of about one acre, with a fairly large reinforced glass dome greenhouse in the middle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This small paradise of plants is not private, but only allows some people to approach - watch, observe, pick and use. The latter two rights are only available to Douglas students and community members, and some teachers use the visit permit here as a reward for outstanding students. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flowering period of violets is from December to April. The violets that bloom in Douglas's garden may be the last of the hundred miles, but their beauty and fragrance have not been affected by a little bit. The doctor carefully took a petal and pleated, just like It is a thin, delicate violet drawn by a watercolor pen. It is placed under the nose and chewed into the teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flowers of Violet are a bit awkward, and can penetrate a little moisturizing sweetness at the base of the tongue. After drying, it tastes sweet and fragrant, and has a bit of licorice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lifted the rest of the flowers to his eyes, and the lilac flowers reminded him of the boy's eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you think of Sasha Hopkins?" he asked abruptly. "It’s the boy who saw the bruise in the afternoon."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zen smiled. "It seems that this bruise can not be separated from Boa?" She turned her head and thought: "A handsome boy, acting very well, less talkative ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you think he will be the enemy of Boa?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The child is already standing opposite him," Jane said. "But it's nothing wrong with it. I think Boa should have an enemy. He has been spoiled by the little girls and the big girls. You know how many people are this year. I submitted the application for admission to me only because each member receives a fine tea bag every month. It is the kind that Boa likes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How many people ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Twenty-six people." This number is very impressive in a school with only three hundred students. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doctor Douglas licked his lips: "Adhere to our principles," he said. "We only need people."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, doctor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tomorrow is the weekend? Call our members, not just violets, roses need to pick... Prepare the distillation tank and microwave extraction equipment." Dr. Douglas said: "Now it is their most beautiful time, it's a pity, this time is so short or even fleeting - and what we can do is to maximize To preserve its beauty and aroma."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha returns to the dormitory Be prepared to take a shower first. The administrator stopped him. He received a new parcel this afternoon. It is the kind that needs to be frozen and refrigerated. He checked it. It is a seven-star spot weighing about two pounds from the fishing port of Felicantu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s terrible, it’s still alive, how did he do it?” he said with admiration: “I’m going back according to the instructions. It is kept in the fresh kitchen cabinet, and the selection is very good. Your father must be a good foodie."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
