			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine had the first words, and Sasha did not have much interest in the circus after the mass. After the mass was over, the two returned to the hostel of Mrs. Alan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simple dinner, Catherine needs to continue to guard the store until 8 pm, while Sasha returns to his attic to spend time reading and painting. The light that was thrown into the attic was golden ochre at first, then gradually turned into pomegranate red, rose, lilac, peacock blue, squid cyan, dove gray, oyster white... the light in the small room sensed the outside light The change, open and slowly light up, the light is soft and bright. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha took out a chrome-yellow oil pastel and rubbed it slightly on a rough textured commercial paper, then took it Contrast with your own skin color - the results are very satisfying, and the difference is small compared to the standard colors stored in the brain, whether it is light or a brush. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What to paint? Sasha closed her eyes, Catherine, of course Catherine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He first used a pencil to make a manuscript, and then repeatedly rubbed the oil pastel with the paper to make it clay-like. Then slowly stretch out your thumb and lick the paint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a very quiet place, and Sasha almost concentrated all his attention on the painting, so when the sound of the crisp sounds on the window of the day, his fingers A slant, Catherine's mouth smashed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up, Mrs. Lalan’s youngest boy was kneeling on the window in the attic, his eyes were scattered, his head was sweating, his hands raised his fists, and he struggled. Knocking on the glass, Sasha had to drop the drawing board, jump on his temporary bed, raise his toes, open the latch on the inside of the window, slowly - he didn't want to push the boy who was lying on the glass window to the roof - - It's not that he didn't think about it, but it's almost impossible to achieve perfection here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The window opened but a quarter of the time, the boy flexed in. His red hair was mixed with uncountable straw, and the sweat flowing down his forehead made traces on the dusty face. Sasha noticed that he did not wear shoes, and his feet and hands were as dark and dirty, and his knees were worn out. A big piece, the only thing that can be found on the shirt is the ketchup in the dust. The reddish brown thick dirt, Sasha remembers that this body or Mrs. Alan specially made him change for today’s mass. Her mind has all been reimbursed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Did you not go to the circus?" asked Sasha. He doesn't remember the boy's name anymore, Tom, Peter, or Joseph? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little boy nodded in nowhere, and shook his head again. He tightened his lips, did not say a word, climbed straight into the sand bed and bedding Inside, put the pillow and the cover all over and put it on the head. Even with a thick blanket, Sasha can feel that he is shaking with desperation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boy closed his eyes in the dark, and all kinds of bells and lines and images crossed in front of his eyes - at first everything was fine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is a group of white pony, rushing out of the scorpion in the whip of the animal trainer, they run around the dry pasture. Perform various rotations and sharp movements, or put your forefoot on the companion's saddle one by one, walk like a human, then stand in a row, stand on the hind legs, and then exit; The clown rushed out, whirlwinding in the field, and after the band’s commander sneaked into it, he ran into the hustle and replaced the soft body actor. The performance of the soft body actor was not very exciting, but it was enough for the child. They have wide eyes - this person is like a plasticine villain who can easily twist his body into whatever way he wants, walk with his hands and wear a hat with his feet; then the clown jumps out for the second time. This time, he invited a beautiful woman to play with him. He and the girl in the ballet skirt continually jumped on the trampoline and made all kinds of incredible movements in the air; Is curl They drilled the fire circle and jumped the cross, and the monkeys, wrapped in Indian headscarves, sitting on the backs of camels and zebras in small vests, followed by elephants, with long noses and shaving knives The hot towel is ready to shave, and the animal trainer has repeatedly invited the audience to serve as the customer of the elephant barber shop, but they should only let their Hercules come to the rescue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the show has passed more than half, the most exciting scene finally appeared, a young man waving a whip, four lions followed him into the field, the iron fence immediately behind them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a brief silence, the man began to talk, his emotions were very excited, and his words were unclear, but his attempt was very clear, under his command. These four powerful giant beasts jumped into the isolation bar of more than two meters in the blink of an eye. There is no protective net on the isolation bar. As long as they jump gently, they will fall into the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boy was scared and screamed, and Mrs. Alan, who was holding him, laughed loudly, as if she saw something ridiculous, not only that, but she also caught The face of the little son, let him cast his gaze into the circus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boy saw the blue-and-white electro-optic light, and every one or two meters outside the fence there was an adult man standing with a stick of electro-optic stick in their hands. The sticks were on the fence, and the four terrible animals were sizzling and they fell back, and the screams of miserable screams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The severe pain caused these beasts to completely lose the rationality and gentleness that was forcibly perfused by humans in the oblate skull. The man was attacked by his own domesticated beast. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this show is not over yet, the circus people were caught by the people in the town, from the boss to the tent staff, the people were temporarily held A meeting, voting decided to interrogate and try them directly here - these "criminals" were thrown into the fence one by one, where four beasts who had tasted human flesh and blood were waiting for them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man screamed and cursed under the fangs of the lion, the boy could not understand much, but he vaguely remembered that there was a woman he was quite familiar with. The name, there is also a word, "revenge." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bible says: "Because people's hatred becomes fierce anger, when revenge is never merciless."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence is still taught by the woman who was yelled by the dying man. She and Sasha’s mother, Catherine, came alone to the town. She came here to seek asylum. A lot of money, because people in the town can't protect her for free. "If you ask for something, you will lose something." The boy's mother, Mrs. Alan, said this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boy didn’t understand very well. He only knew that the clothes, jewellery and bags that he had seen in this woman soon appeared on the other women in the town. Even her mother, Mrs. Alan, wore one of her watches. Her slender neck and wrist were replaced by a rustling shackle from the slave period, and she had to keep working. , harvesting lavender, picking grapes and spiny olives, and teaching the children in the town to write and read at night. He once called her teacher respectfully, but was reprimanded by Mrs. Alan because this is what she must The obligation to perform, and... she is still a "wife." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His brother said that she is a "wife" shared by men in the town. Also said that if they are big enough, she will also be their "wife." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn't want a "wife", he only wants "teacher", the gentle, patient, teacher who will touch his hair and say good boy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She disappeared as suddenly as she arrived. One night, when the boy asked why she hadn’t come to class, Mrs. Alan told him that she passed through the town. The vote, they decided not to shelter this "wife". They called and she was taken away by the people who had been chasing her, and every family in the town got an interest-free loan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
