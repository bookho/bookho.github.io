			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun is strong, Mary Kent carefully walks on the slope leading to the underground parking lot. According to the date of the last menstrual cramp, her due date is still full. For a week, she felt that her stomach was big enough and she was always falling. She felt like a mouse that had hidden eggs, and that egg would fall out at any time, but it was checked in the morning. At the time, her doctor thought she had no signs of premature birth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now she has to use the tip of her finger to hook the handle of the shopping cart. The shopping cart is too heavy. She told herself that next time I don’t want to buy so much olive oil at once. Or soda, even if they are playing a pair of folds, she is panting... separated by a huge stomach, the pregnant woman stumbles and walks down the overwhelming four-wheeled monster, her feet are sour and swollen, walking The ugly gesture of involuntarily gives birth to pity - when the shopping cart suddenly disengages from Mary Kent’s hand, and the owner of the shopping cart slams forward, the people around her seem to be not very Unexpected exclamation, several people who have been paying attention to here flew around to help, two people stopped the shopping cart running on the slopes, others went up the slope - it is comforting, or the mother of the future form Without being injured as a result, a responsive gentleman abandoned the two bags in his hand and seized her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary. Kent was pulled into a hard, flat arms, two powerful arms out of her underarms, hanging her in the air, her The toes are still a little bit squatting, but I can't use any strength. The hot cheeks are close to the smooth-skinned shirt. The button on the shirt is stuck in her eyes. It is heavy, cool, and has the unique multicolored pearls of the shells. After a few seconds, she realized what was going on. Some people moved closer and helped the man behind her to transfer her to the flat. Mary heard someone being connected to the hospital. "Wait... wait," she stroked her stomach, maybe something happened too fast. The fetus was safe and stable, and did not make any gesture of discomfort. Her sudden heartbeat was gradually slowing down. "I think I am fine, thank you." She said, "My two children are still at home." She explained Road: "I agreed with them to go home at two o'clock."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A full-fledged middle-aged woman thinks that Mary Kent is best cautious, after all, she The belly is already big. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, I might be able to help a little." Someone said calmly behind her, Mary turned her head and she was surprised to find that she was caught in time. Self, and said that she can continue to help her is the new teacher of St. Thomas Church Primary School, Claude Streif, a thin, elegant, gentle and almost rare male, when Mary first saw him. In extreme temper and depression - she received a call from Mr. Humbert, she had to pick up Dolores, who was once again in school, while the little girl was still humiliating them... even In this way, he still left a deep impression on Mary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello, Mrs. Kent." Streif nodded to Mary, even in this weather, there was still no trace of sweat on his skin. The black hair is still neat and the silk is not chaotic. "I can accompany her to find a place to rest for a while," he said to Mary, and to others. "And then see the situation and send her home." Or go to the hospital."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary is still hesitant at first, she doesn't want to trouble someone who is not familiar and close, but she must consider for her children, no matter It was the one inside the stomach or the one outside the stomach. She was very embarrassed to express her gratitude... When the incidents were settled, people spread out in twos and threes. Before that, they helped Mary and Streif to pick up the fallen items. There was a fresh foie gras in Streif's items. When it fell on the ground, the storage bag with constant temperature coagulant broke. Fortunately, the package of foie gras was not damaged, and a young man generously donated his own crisper. Streif expressed his gratitude to him, but unfortunately there was no ice in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this problem is very well solved. There is an Italian-opened coffee shop just across the street. They not only supply espresso, espresso, milk coffee or aperitif, but also a variety of delicious snacks. The waiter knew Mr. Streif, and he quickly picked up a stainless steel bucket of ice – a translucent crisper was placed on the table, and the box was condensed with dense water droplets. The temperature in the cafe was also played. A little low, Mary's bladder was constantly oppressed by the chill. She went to the bathroom and felt hungry when she returned to her seat... This really made her extremely embarrassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She doesn’t know if Mr. Streif has this, but after he has given him milk for himself and Mary’s milk composition far exceeds other coffees. It is also recommended that Mary is really happy when adding one or many snacks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary had an ancient spinach sauce, she took a bite and was covered with black pepper; and Mr. Streif asked for a copy. Golden and fragrant snacks, the Italian name Mary of this meal can't understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is an olive-fried pig brain slice, very fresh." Mr. Streif introduced in a timely manner: "There will be a chance to try it later. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary reflexively glanced at the crisper next to it, and a faint vermilion was visible in the milky white ice, Streiff Mr.'s taste is really different. She shook her head slightly, remembering that Anne had told her that Sasha Streif is now being looked after by Mr. Streif... a man, Mary thought, He may indeed love his children deeply, but inevitably, they will always be careless in some way. If they are still just a parent and a teacher, Mary may not say anything more, but Mr. Streif gave her a lot of help today. “Today's dinner?” She pointed her finger at the food in the crisper. Although she never tried this luxury item of up to tens of dollars per ounce, she knew that the fresh foie gras must be twenty-four. Eat it in the hour or make foie gras, otherwise it will be a violent thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Flush for ten minutes, then soak in water for thirty minutes, and finally heat it in the coarse salt for a period of twelve to fifteen hours.” Mr. Leif patiently replied: "Very delicious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I have heard of it." Mary stirred the face of the emerald with a fork, then Picking up the soup at the tip of the fork, the soup originally contains basil leaves, parsley, sweet oregano, and she added pepper, which is really exciting: "But you might consider it later. At least don't give your child too much foie gras," she shrugged. "The French claim that the foie gras is delicious, nutritious, and can lower the body's cholesterol because of the unsaturated fat inside... But in fact, this The food is not healthy," she repeated and reinterpreted what she saw: "Fat foie gras is full of fat... no matter what the merchants say, fat is fat, as long as it is eaten, whether saturated or unsaturated, it will Increase heat, especially absorption ratio People who are better off. 'Do not increase the body's fat content' is just wishful thinking - in reality, no one is seen to eat because the foie gras is fat, just because the stuff is too expensive, no one can eat." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Oh," Mr. Streif was silent for a moment, his eyes widened slightly, and then he smiled. "You "That's right," he responded modestly. "Indeed, I saw it in the newspaper - a newspaper created by the Animal Welfare Organization, what is it called? 'Green Earth'?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, I don't know..." Mary's cheek color slightly deepened: "This is not me... Oh, I mean, this is the information that Anne found, in me. After she got pregnant, she gave me a list of foods, above... I mean, I know about it from there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
