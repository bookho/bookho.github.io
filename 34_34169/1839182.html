			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more than 1,300 large and small churches on Poseidon Island. Basically, four people can be evenly distributed. Some are unusually tall and majestic, or exquisite. Gorgeous, such as the Cathedral of Palermo and the Cathedral of the Virgin of the Miracle; some are small and only one room - not so much a church, but rather a stone house built around the niche that enshrines Jesus or the Madonna. There may be one or two small rooms next to and behind, which are provided to the priest to live and perform his duties. In general, there will be a marble tray on the open space in front of the church, which is fixed with cement and cleaned. Sheng Shuibei, so that when the baby is baptized, his or her relatives can be fortunate enough to be onlookers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temporary shelter of Chegar's choice is such a small church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one who is here is Peter, one of the old folks of Chegal, who was also a childhood partner of "Tang" and also followed him quite long. For a while, but when Chegal was twenty years old, a bomb placed by an enemy blew up the former's right foot. He could no longer stay with Chegal, and Tang arranged him to go to the warehouse. It was also a bad thing, but Chegal knows that he is not here. After Chegal has inherited the rights and status of "Tang", he invited the Bishop of the Sea God Island to taste his new wine in his vineyard. Peter declared that he felt the vocation. He was assigned to a seminary. It is worth mentioning that he is a true "genius". It takes ten years to complete. He has only read half a year and graduated back to Poseidon. The island, and a deacon in the small village where he was born, just the old priest there is old enough. In order to reward his decades of service, he was transferred to another warm and spring parish. - Peter is justified as a priest - one Qiejia Le rooted nail into the interior of the island of Poseidon body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a screaming "Tang" and his new friend appeared in Peter's bedroom, a priest with a soft nightcap was attached to his head. They were not surprised to receive them, he limped out the weapons and clothes from the storage room - Chegal was even naked, and then brought bread, wine and cheese, eggs from the kitchen, two Apparently, the people who had spent a lot of time had a good meal, and finally he came up with a bowl of steaming water, and a new soap, towel and shaving knife for them to wash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are still some things to do," said Chegaler. "Help me make a few calls."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people called by Chegal are still less than a dozen. Although they are supposed to fall asleep according to the habits of the Poseidon Island, everyone is coming fast, and they are dressed and neatly dressed – not so luxurious. Several of them even had the rough skin of the ordinary people, and their faces were creased. When they bent down to kiss Chegar's hand, Dr. Hopkins saw the enlarged joints and cracked nails. It is very likely that An hour ago, they worked in their own olive groves or vineyards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chegal is very simple but clearly describes what happened before, including his betrayal of his most trusted beater, but he did not say Meyer It seems that this most suspected person has not been included in the list of traitors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know who did it? Right?" asked a middle-aged man, his coat exuding a rich olive oil scent, "Cechal Except for you, only one person can mobilize so many people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changalle closed his mouth like a problem that he did not want to answer. The child turns his gaze to the other direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a big deal," another said: "You must speak the name clearly, Don," he added: "In fact, you are We should be confessed to us last time, but you insist on keeping silent. Well, we have moved you, but we have also accommodated the traitor and the murderer, so he can seize another chance, and this time, he almost succeeded. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chougal raised his head and stood in the dark, Hopkins straightened, he never saw it on one's face. Such sincere and deep sorrow, anger and sorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Meyare." Tang said this, tears flowed down his eyes, and he shook his lips, his palms pressed against his chest, as if Someone just gave him a knife - no one was surprised, more people's eyes showed a sympathetic look - and Chegal again looked down, as if he was already overwhelmed: "... of course," he Weak and weakly added: "It may also be a complete misunderstanding... We must verify, dear friends... We must verify..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The Lord is clear and wrong among us.” Peter stood up and said, “What else do you want to prove? Chegal, our good man, our leader, our dearest friend and father, where are you standing now? Not the Eastern Confederation It’s not the Western Confederation, nor is it an island full of enemies. So who is chasing you, will you die? The scar on your body is the best evidence, someone is murdering you, and you are awarded him. Authority and power," he Seriously said, "Everyone can see that you are only one line away from death, and this is not his compassion. He is not just cutting off your clothes (Note 1), he is deliberately harming you, to take it from you. Life and the laurels, this is already a clear and clear thing. He committed the sin of murdering blood relatives, see, see, if we are still silent, deliberately indulging, the open mouth of hell Will swallow us with the sinner!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Note 1: This allusion comes from, David is the son-in-law and general of Saul of Israel, and Saul suspects that David has a heartless heart, and leads the army to pursue him. David had a chance to kill him, but in the end it was only Cut off his clothes.)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Peter is right, Don Chegal," the first man who said that he said: "This is already It’s the second time, Tang, you should have made a decision on the first time. Meyare violated the 'silent law' and he sold you to him.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," Chegal retorted: "Those people are not."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s worse than that," the man said: There are no courts, no judges, no lawyers, no clues we can trace back and people who accept bribes. We don’t know anything about that ghost place. In fact, many people think you are dead.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey," Chegal said broadly: "Those guys may be related, but definitely not silent." 'The few types that are strictly forbidden.'<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So we accepted your opinion." Peter said: "We forgive the traitors and the result is to be him. I bite the second bite wickedly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is the solution?" Chegal said sadly: "He is the son of my brother, my Scorpion, my heir."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No longer." The man snorted. "The killing person will not be redeemed even at the end of the world. He couldn't be 'Tang'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a slap in the face of Chegal, as if he had a resolute comment for his own words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first batch of summoned people left, except Peter, and then within an hour or two, more people came, they said to Chegal Loyalty and condolences, accept his orders and act immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hop Hopkins noticed an interesting thing - he never left the room throughout the process, but whether it was Peter or later came in People have never asked him this outsider, without asking, without explanation, without refusing, they trust and obey "Tang" in a natural and sincere manner and accept "friends of friends" that he believes to be convinced (meaning the gang member). This can be compared with the previous group of people, he said, Meyare and Toto are very different - these guys are the real arms and ears of Chegal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people are more plain and simple than Toto. Some of them seem to be a bit sluggish, mostly expressionless and thin, but as a proverb says, "indifferent softness is harder than everything." In the first four decades of his life, Dr. Hopkins met these black and thin people more than once - he once killed one, and the other two successfully sent the doctor into his enemies. If there is no Catherine, the mother of Sasha, "Ghoul" Anthony Hopkins may have become a fat pig food - he has never seen these fishermen and farmers, as everyone knows, It only takes 10,000 or tens of thousands of pieces, and these gentle, lazy little people who look like sheep on a hillside can instantly become a sharp bayonet or a fiery bullet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thirty-fifth person left the house that was not very spacious, and he had a bit of gunpowder on his body, his face was covered with oil and sweat. The bloody man and the old Andriana walked into the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: "I am sorry, Tang, I have not been able to bring Besib out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"He is missing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to take a break "Hopkins said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked behind the house, and the priest on the terrace behind the house was placed with a very wide and comfortable rattan recliner, every place was like that. Smooth, white, and flexible, Hopkins estimates that its value will never be less than a thousand. This is not something that ordinary village priests have the ability to purchase, but it should be noted that here is the sea god island, "horse The birthplace of Sawyer, such as Anthony Hopkins, is a place where the violent bodies of almost every national violent institution can become a guest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins lay down on the chair and comfortably placed his legs on the railing of the terrace, and the fingers of the slender legs crossed. Put it on your abdomen and close your eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in a matter of ten seconds, he entered his own brain, hiding in the memory of the winter fog, quietly for his own The master opened the door, and Hopkins walked up the dark brown ladder that erupted, and walked lightly into the space on the third floor, the most intimate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
