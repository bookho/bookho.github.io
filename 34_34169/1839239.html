			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha Hopkins in the dark is tense and tired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the time being only Besib found this, he was sitting on the VIP table, and there was only a wide waterway between Sasha and his eyes. Under the faint light, there is a light golden light that makes him see what ordinary people can't see - the light hair is close to the forehead, and Sasha Hopkins is expressionless, his lips tightly Stretched, straight like a line drawn on white paper, his purple eyes are difficult to distinguish the color of the light when the light is dim, but Besib can find his sight - the boy’s sight does not fall on On the keyboard of the harpsichord, it was followed by Xiqiao. His shoulders were slightly arched and his feet did not step on the pedals of the ancient piano. They stepped on the ground and the heels were slightly suspended. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps Besib’s gaze was too direct, Little Hopkins turned his head and looked at him, his cheeks sparkling, not makeup The glitter, but the sweat, they stayed from his forehead, flowing down the eyebrows along the cheekbones, from the chin to the neck, and finally into the black collar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishb knows that he has no sense of music at all, but he at least knows if he is facing danger, just like the last time Xiqiao and Hope Kings's chorus - it made him feel very uncomfortable, when he almost exhausted his whole body to resist the effects of it - for this tonight he brought a specially set earphones, almost The earphones wrapped around his half head blocked most of the sound, and he would still be attracted, but the attraction was almost lost after layer-by-layer filtering and reverse sound waves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boy from Poseidon Island hesitated and took off the headphones. The loud noise created by the audio equipment and the reflector was like the tide. His eardrum, he took a deep breath, waited for a while, the ear perfectly adapted to hear everything that was heard into his brain after the shock, and the sound of Xiqiao was as beautiful as a gem. The sorghum is unique, but Besib soon noticed that Hopkins’s piano has changed. It is no longer the golden pedestal under the jewel, nor is it wrapped around the wings that send it to the sky. It is flawless and acquainted with the song, but in fact, each of its syllables has a delay and advance. The song of Xiqiao was destroyed by it, but the delay and advance were too small, and even the small professionals could not feel it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besb ​​is certainly not possible to hear it. But he can use his body and brain to determine - it stands to reason that a complete, live chorus that hasn't been processed too much should have a greater effect on him - no, he doesn't have that again because of his own The anger and fear that burst out of power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has been with Sasha for a long time, they are running on the empty beach. Swim in the warm waters, take classes in school, receive training from thugs in confined rooms or open courtyards (accurately beaten and beaten, attacked and attacked), from unarmed fighting to various types of guns ۰ 和 and knife, occasionally. They will also sit in front of Dr. Anthony Hopkins and listen to him telling interesting little stories. They bathe together and sometimes sleep on a bed. Gradually getting used to the smell of another person, heartbeat and body temperature - this is really not easy, Besib and Sasha are not the kind of good children who will come across the arms as long as you open your arms and smile. - They must be close to each other a little bit, cautious and conservative, and strive to make the other party feel their goodwill and not let the distance be too close to make the other party feel that they are a threat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared to Besib. Hopkins is to be more indifferent. He seems to have only his father. Therefore, Besib often has to do more. In this regard, Chekal Bissand, another father expressed his approval, but he also reminded Besib that Poseidon is the real foundation. Besib agrees with this, so He will look for opportunities to introduce Bep to Grande, and there may be others in the future, but he also needs Sasha Hopkins, a friend like Chegal and Anthony Hopkins. Poseidon Island needs new blood, especially after both Chegal and Besib have confirmed their abilities, they need to be "the same" as themselves. Of course, if there is a woman in Poseidon Island who will be named Hopkins in the future, it would be best. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this, Besib has always been very concerned about this friend, he soon got used to it and found fun, Sasha Hopkins As quiet as his father, it is hard to estimate. To understand their minds, especially Anthony Hopkins, is more difficult than dancing with the devil. Fortunately, Besib does not have to face him for the time being. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After more than a thousand days and nights of speculation and meditation, Besib finally can read a little information from Little Hopkins. Many times, this ability can help a lot - for example, now he can know that Sasha Hopkins is fighting against Xiqiao - not the same as when they first met, and singing The room was different, and it was very different from the last rehearsal. Sasha Hopkins not only resisted the song of Xiqiao, but he also successfully countered it. He is cracking and eliminating this. Curse - Although Besib does not understand why Hopkins wants to do this, he is still vigilant and ready. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beautiful sounds that reverberate in the venue gradually fell and slowly disappeared. Xixi’s first song was over, she stood on a huge pillar. Motionless, red-eyed eyes overlooked the humans who were obsessed with her. Besib suddenly thought of the red-eyed waterfowl that he had seen, the scavengers of the sea, and the fishermen thought that the bird was the living body of the dead. It was a bad omen. At that time, it was also like Xiqiao, standing on the top of the mast with a pair of skinny legs, and it was silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general supervisor of the stage took a clap, the staff was busy, and the lights hidden in the auditorium flashed and awakened them. In the display, the audience wake up as they dream, they stand up, shout, slap their hands, throw flowers and small gifts on the stage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A white flower mandala fell on Boa’s shoulder, and he frowned frowningly, originally trying to bounce it, but found it After changing fresh and beautiful, he changed his mind. He grabbed it and held it in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xi壬 raised his hands, the audience suddenly stopped all the movements and sounds, and the sound of rustling came from the monitor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She wants to talk," a stage supervisor said, "no such arrangement."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The general supervisor of the stage connected Gregory Cosso: "What should I do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let her say," Gregory said: "No. She can give us a surprise."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," the general supervisor said to the microphone: "Only two minutes, Xiqiao."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xi壬 reveals a weird smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Today," she said, the voice initially trembled slightly, but she even calmed down and calmed down: "I was the last time I stood in front of you and sang for you." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The audience immediately heard a wave of opposition and pleading. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is my decision." Xiqiao suddenly raised his voice: "My decision, my dear friends." Her voice suddenly went down. : "I know, you like me, are you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Love me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Love!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, forgive me." His eyes blinked, "close-up." The stage supervisor said that the camera was moving, and 50,000 viewers and millions of people on the West Coast saw her long eyelashes and brighter red that were wet by tears. eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
