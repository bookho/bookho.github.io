"There is a leg." Hopkins smiled. His patient had a mixed ball that he liked to take a wheelchair to paralyze the victim. He was sitting outside in a wheelchair and swindling the little boy or the little girl to push him into the house. Give them a lollipop or ice cream, Hopkins cuts his two legs, picks the good meat and makes two dishes to feed the stray cat outside - Sasha used to be at Hopkins He visited this person in the Palace of Memory. He was pale and looked wilting. His appearance was not like a change. Although he is indeed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door opened, and Hopkins took the lead to step out of the door. Catherine waited until Sasha licked her finger and made her move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She is much more." Besib stared at her. "What did you drink for her?" Catherine couldn't see, he could see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Conte Cali, two ounces of gin, ice cubes, syrup and pop champagne," Sasha put the empty glass into the coat Pocket: "There are also barbital and magnesium sulfate heptahydrate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Barbital, I know," Besib followed behind Sasha. Car: "But that seven waters...what...what?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bishb," Sasha sighed: "You really need "Tutoring," he said in a sentence: "A lot of tutoring, magnesium sulfate heptahydrate is Epsom salt. As far as I know, Poseidon Island is still in use today, when children's tongues tremble or pull out. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib made a bitter face, he remembered the taste of the stock. He couldn't remember how many times he had been smothered by the old Andriana with this salty and bitter potion (note): "Do you carry these with you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha did not speak, these things are all prepared for his father. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Besib said, Catherine is much more. She took Hopkins's arm and stood beside him, slightly lowering her head and looking down. Hopkins waved to Sasha, and Sasha stepped forward and Catherine saw him. Time gave him a blank smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slightly cool, fresh air came on the way, they walked through a long corridor, the top of the corridor was encrusted with crystal. There is no direct light, all the light passes through these big eggs, and the cutting line is sharp. The artificial crystal with a smooth facet and no fine lines cuts into the human pupil after multiple refraction, and leaves an uncountable colored spot on the dark gray mirror wall. The color of the carpet is difficult under such light. It is distinguished by ordinary people in color and pattern. It is dark purple, with gold and royal blue wheel patterns embedded in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waiter pushed the heavy double door for them. There are already a lot of people in the casino, but they are much quieter than the Paradise Palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no Mac here, no matter what the gambling file maintains a fairly spacious distance, the position of the roulette is not far from the door, in the form of the Royal Roulette Bet, this way is not very good for the casino. It has two betting methods, inner and peripheral. The inner bet is any number from zero to thirty-six (according to the number of engravings on the wheel), while the outer note is red or black. Or any combination of numbers. There is also a cumulative jackpot, that is, when a number appears five times in a row, as with the "200 machines connected to the Mac," the amount is cumulative, and the person who casts it can get a breathtaking A huge prize. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib looked around curiously. Hopkins is right, there are quite a few of his peers here. The teenagers are as well-dressed as their uncles and fathers, with a black or white bow tie. The hair that has been waxed and shaped shines in the light of infinite natural light. The girls are like adult women. Show your thin shoulders and partial breasts that are not yet fully developed. You can never see even a piece of man-made fiber that is only the size of a fingernail. They are all hairy, leathery, silky, silky, satin. ... the delicate neck and wrists carry valuable jewels, and several of them will stay in the eyes of Besib. A bold girl will smear red lips after the champagne glasses and print on the glasses. A heart shaped print. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The casino manager has long been notified that at the moment Hopkins left the villa, he was ready - Big Hopkins in one Sitting at the roulette table, the waiter gave him a chip loaded with a tray, forty gold chips, fifty red inlaid with gold, and one hundred inlaid with gold. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins put a milky white chip and ten gold chips in front of Catherine, you may be able to ignore a lot of outside in the "Tianqiu" casino Unimpeded laws or rules, but no one will be naive to think that you can occupy a position without betting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine frowned, and she picked up a golden chip and bit it in her mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great Hopkins didn’t immediately put down the bet, didn’t care about the ivory ball that dribbled, he didn’t even look at red and black, and Represents a completely finished green trench. He asked the administrator of the roulette file for a record card, which was densely recorded and clearly recorded the rotation of the roulette in the first six hours - many self-conscious and rational people are vowed to say The ivory ball eventually fell there, and there was no trace of the relationship with the previous results. The roulette that looks like a whirlpool of desire, like its tens of thousands of siblings, whether it's the speed of rotation, the groove with words, or other tiny machines hidden under the glazed surface. After dozens of tests and tests before the first use, after use, there will be professionals to adjust and repair every twenty-four hours to ensure that each component can be obedient and dial the wheel and The hands throwing small balls are always so insidious and mysterious – they may actually have the law, but you never want to see or catch them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins brought the record card to the side and showed it to the two boys. The first set of numbers, that is, the chances of appearing from one to twelve were significantly lower. In both groups, Hopkins picked up a stack of red chips, just like giving cookies to children, distributing them piece by piece in his fancy numbers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine’s fingers moved on gold and white chips, and Sasha noticed that the people around him were nervous – not a 10,000-dollar bet. But it is definitely rare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look at my luck." Catherine said she used her fingertips to push out two golden chips and then continued to point her finger at the two numbers. The waiter glanced at Hopkins and pushed the two chips into place with a small "mop" (they used to call the poles used to transfer chips or cash). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dealer raises his hand and signals the start of the new game. He turns the wheel in a counterclockwise direction and then throws it clockwise between the little finger and the ring finger. Small ball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ivory ball leaps forward in the spinning wheel, and the speed of the wheel is slowly slowing down. As it fell, Catherine picked up a glass of champagne from the waiter's plate and seemed to drink casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Her teeth are shaking," Besib leaned over and pulled Lashasha's little finger: "When do you think she became awake?" ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She has always been awake," Sasha said. He put his shoulder down and Bessib's head slipped down: "I gave her a sedative that is not a hypnotic." He hesitated for a moment: "I think she is a little bit." Grasp."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"More than one point," Besib said: "She won. Two numbers, she has all hit."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People made a low, small wave of cheers, and the golden chips were pushed to Catherine. Two handsome waiters brought a new champagne to her, cheering her with the baritone and the voice and tone of the bass singer, which sounded quite sincere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the few numbers set by Hopkins, some are not in the middle, some are in the middle, and the middle part is larger than the missing part, so he said Still won, but because of the relationship with Catherine, he did not get much attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine turned and waved to Sasha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha grabbed Besib, as the boy took his big teddy bear and walked over to Catherine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is for you." Catherine said, she grabbed two golden chips and stuffed it to Sasha, one of the other. Then he hurriedly turned his head and picked up a stack of milky white chips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She played with Hopkins a dozen times and won the most, and in the end, the number of chips in front of them was almost the same as when they entered, but One-half of them have turned into gold. People are following their bets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine stood up, she set aside ten golden chips from her pile and the number was definitely more than the previous milky white chips, and the remaining chips were lost by her. Into her soft sheepskin handbag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she passed Sasha, she stopped and grabbed a chip from her handbag (there were several gold in it) and stuffed it into two Boy's jacket pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I thought she didn't like us to gamble, or to gamble." Besib whispered after she walked away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She doesn't like gambling," Sasha said. "But she is happy to beat my father in any way."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
