Beep Said: "Abby gave her parents 5,000 yuan."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And, she is not called Abby."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Besib turned and looked at him, Beppe thought he would ask the child what he was calling, but he said nothing and went straight into Hopkins’s room. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beip shrugged his shoulders, closed the page, and he still had a programming job. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, a loud bang made him jump from the chair, and when he pushed the computer away, Beppe had already pulled it out of the drawer. With the gun, he pulled the insurance and walked quickly to the door of Sasha's room, and the door was closed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bishb! Sasha!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing!" cried Bessie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bep made a face, took the gun back to its original position, continued to do his homework, and the gun was placed next to the drink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five minutes ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha Hopkins’s computer is also on, and an email is displayed on the screen, which is in the 13th district and adjacent to the Sandy family. In some of the two regions, most of the suburbs are farms, factories, and an abandoned monastery, while the most urban areas are restaurants and laundries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no light in the room, the darkness made the room look colder, and Sasha crossed his fingers, and the eyes reflected the white light from the screen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha didn’t talk, there was only one chair in the room, Besib walked over and sat on the carpet, carrying his head, and Sasha had already sorted them out. Qing Erchu, Chegaler. Bissance’s chips can only be said to be a slap in his total assets, but for the two big boys, for Abby, for the northern children who will come here in the future. , enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you think?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If all goes well," Sasha said: "The profit will be a little higher than expected." He paused. Then explained: "There are farms and factories in these industries. The farm warehouses and factory buildings can become a large gymnasium after a certain renovation. Abby can put at least four boxing rings in it, the only thing to worry about. It’s transportation, but I think Judas’ money can support him to buy buses and cars; restaurants are in the city, laundry is in the community. There are parking lots nearby, just remove the furniture and equipment inside, lighting and decoration Adjustments can be put into use right away – before May, Abby will have 200 large gymnasiums that can legally open a children's boxing match.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Crowe will be very happy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It will be very happy than Sangdi,"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sudden silence is like a stone in the middle of two boys, don't BU was born in Neptune Island, sand longer than Neptune Island, Neptune Island for asylum and their gifts are never free. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you hesitating?" said Little Hopkins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib looked at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha slammed back, avoiding an unexpected attack and sliding the chair backwards. Pulling the power cord, the display turned down from the table and flipped over the chair, which was what Beep heard outside the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing!" When Bep asked outside, Besib replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The screen is off. The windows and doors are closed, the boys are in the room without light, and the eyes are shining like the leopards at night. This situation lasts for a few seconds, and they rush to each other without warning or tacitly. I made a group of sounds. They received the same training on Poseidon Island, staying with each other longer than anyone else. They understand each other's strengths and also know all the weaknesses; they are also versatile, agile, powerful, muscular, blood flowing, heartbeat, and biting teeth. Take turns and use your clenched fist to slam the other's face and lower abdomen, hit your knees and kick with your feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib hooked Sasha's calf, and when he lost his balance, Sasha grabbed his neck. Two boys, whose heights are close to adults, slammed on the floor of the room, making a muffled sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They lift their arms and force their opponents with their legs. The strength is like a buffalo with two hairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody knows who first let go of their fingers, the boys are exhausted, lying side by side on the hard wood floor, breathing slightly, sure that the other party is absolutely not Under the mercy. Besib’s painful cheeks were broken computer screens, and they were surrounded by all sorts of debris. He even saw a blanket, and God knew how it fell from the bed and wrapped around his calf. ? He was too lazy to continue thinking. He looked at his friends and brothers. Sasha rolled his lips and smiled at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't like this," Besib said, "I don't like it at all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp On the night of killing John Carson, he said so, but this time it is more determined and clearer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't like it either," Sasha said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door opened and Beep looked up in a lightning bolt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, have you finished talking?" He looked at the two people who came out and said, "It’s really intense enough, isn’t it?" He is not because of this. The fuss, the education received since childhood, told them that violence can solve all problems, even the necessary communication between father and son, brothers, and friends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Complete." Besib took a bottle of metal canned juice from the refrigerator and put it on his face, which was different from ordinary people. The ability to ensure that he does not have to stare at a face with a nose and a swollen face out of the room, but he always feels hot on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think I have to change rooms." Sasha said that he looks much better than Besib, but he also has a bit of a word. Vague. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will contact Amp," Beppe said. "But do you need to contact Mr. Hopkins first?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He has a bit of a thing lately," Sasha replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So where are you going?" Beppe said: "I have to know this. Is it Grand Town or Lafayette?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lafayette," Besib regained a can of juice: "I went with Sasha, Saturday, stayed there, by the way, these two days Sand can live in my room first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They glanced at each other half a room, Beppe did not notice, but Beppe knew they were in Lafayette Unique "work". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not difficult to get permission from the school, although Mr. Nenet is very curious about the room that was like a catastrophic hurricane, but he ended up with nothing. Said, signed the application. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp, who hasn’t seen it for a while, is darker and stronger. He’s like a little smaller from the mold of his father or brother. Mud embryos. "I'll give you a shot," he said cheerfully. "Pei Pei drives."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pepi, Besib, the nominal father Opened is a lm008, this semi-open car with a front-mounted raised off-road vehicle that looks simple and violent, but the interior is extremely luxurious and comfortable, mahogany dashboard, sporty Leather seats, automatic air conditioning, color-changing insulated window glass... Oh, yes, there is an embedded car refrigerator with stereo and fully enclosed compression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is coffee and juice in the fridge, the most is lemonade, the one that Besib likes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha noticed this, changed position during the break, let Besib sit in the passenger seat, and he and Anpu sit behind He noticed that Pepe was satisfied with this small change and danced. As far as he knows, Pepi has no children, and before Chekal Bissand clearly stated to everyone that Besib should be surnamed Sangdi, he really loves his son - and now it should be love. The boy's. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also noticed that Besib, in the gap waiting for the red light, would use his elbows and relatives to collide with his former father and face him. blink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After entering the city, Pepi took them to a vast supermarket with everything they needed for Sasha. They only used one. After more than an hour, I finished this thing and didn't waste time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next thing is the right thing - they have 123 large gyms to see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four people bought the tickets as honestly as the average audience. They found that although each gym has a boxing match, the children’s boxing match Not every gym has it, and four-fifths of the fists in the children’s boxing are all Tani, and as Chegal reminds, white-skinned children will attract gamblers to bet. Even if they didn't win a game at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lafayette is a large area, rich, clean, civilized, and its residents are keen to spend a hundred or more to see them The same kind of cubs in the same family will kill you in pairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to Abby’s gymnasium, they also watched the industry in the Thirteen Regions of Sangdi. They ate at the restaurants opened by the people of Poseidon. Sleeping in the hotel opened by the people of Poseidon Island, and also made shirts and suits in the clothing store opened by the people of Poseidon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If these industries are taken back, then where should these people go?" Sasha asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peppi smiled, Little Hopkins grew up on Poseidon Island, but he is not a pure Poseidon Island after all: "In addition to traitors, each Neptune Island people will not be abandoned - they will have new jobs, just like now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha slightly understands, obviously, Poseidon The “real” work of the islanders is not the chef, the hospitality, the waiters, the cleaners, the tailors, and the like. These “legitimate occupations” are just their umbrellas and camouflage colors. From beginning to end, they have only one profession – the thugs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe, when the new gym is opened, it will be arranged for some of the Poseidon people, both for protection and for supervision. After all, Abby hangs The biggest bait in front of Sangdi is the dividend of the gambling game. It is hard to feel peace of mind without the eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let me see," Pepi looked at his golden Gulette watch: "It’s five o'clock, we can see another one. Then we should go to dinner."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then Besib and Sasha once again saw the other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, it is called another Nepalese boy, because he was changed another name, his information has also been changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
