			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine took a deep breath, "But..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you still can't stand it Live to go to pity them," Sasha said softly, his fingers relaxed, stroking the Katherine gold woolen curls, then let the thumb across her forehead, sliding down the contour of the face, and finally fixed behind the ear, Together with the other fingers, holding her head - the boy's nails have been trimmed very carefully, the nails are neither more than the fingers, nor the "sharp" and bald and flat like some careless people, they are beautiful The curvature is healthy pink, the surface is smooth, the nails are clean, the palms are dry, and the fingertips are cold: "You can't turn a blind eye, don't listen, even if you know they used to hurt you, hurt you, the future Maybe you still want to hurt you, but when they are at a disadvantage and in that tragic situation, you can't be as indifferent to others – you may have told yourself, and because of this temperament, you have suffered Sin, hurt heart But you can't change it, you can't do it, no one, anything can't affect you on this - I don't know how it came out, Catherine, but I know, it goes deep into the bone marrow, deep-rooted. I help No, no one can, because you don't want to."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boy's fingers are slender, but he is still young, Catherine's hand is big enough to cover them, She held them silently, the temperature of the palms was always higher than the back of the hand, she thought she could warm them, but there was a voice in her heart telling her that it was purely futile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha waited for a while, the ice in the juice had completely melted, he wanted to pull back his hand, Catherine strengthened the power, she was almost Weeping and starting to talk - at the beginning, Sasha couldn't understand what she was saying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I...just an ordinary person..." She said vaguely: "Normal, you know? Sasha... No, Maybe you don't understand. Because you...there are those people around you...the ghoul's hills!" She shouted with resentment: "Look, see! What are you? Gamblers, Liars, thieves, murderers! Everyone should live in hell for 10,000 times! They influenced you! They made you so cold and cruel, cruel and selfish! You don't even know the feelings of a normal person..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you are talking about compassion, and love..." Sasha looked calmly and said: "I think I have, just not much, at least not much. The point of throwing at will, especially pity. Of course, it is also possible because I never easily despise a person, whether it is an enemy or a relative, or a friend." He moved his fingers and easily got rid of Catherine's mastery. "People are equal, Catherine. Whether it is from * or spirit, when you pity a person, you put yourself above a position higher than him, especially when you know clearly What do you do, and when he knows it—this is a usury that works together on the spirit and *. What you give is only a meager care and love, but he has to use his freedom and dignity to return— - A high interest rate, and you still forced him to accept it. This kind of behavior is no better than stealing and robbery. To be exact, it is even worse. Because you always ask for the price is just so confident."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't have it," Catherine retorted. "I never..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have," Sasha interrupted her: "I am saying. I He quickly followed up and said: "Undoubtedly, you love me, but you also pity me, deep pity. Because you think that I am incomplete and distorted. You take me away from my father, according to your method." Take care of me. Guide me, hope that I can live like an ordinary person in the future - this is what you want me to pay," he smiled and shook his head: "You never asked me about this idea, let alone change your own. Practice or change my... You didn’t think about it at all. You are blindly stubborn like a blindfolded blind man, and you follow the path you thought with all your heart. You didn’t even think about it later...if I really become an ordinary person according to your thoughts, an optimistic thought with a baby's ignorance and ignorance, and an ordinary person with a sad, sorrowful and sorrowful feeling - God bless, even if we really find a paradise like you imagined Then, just as the Jews hide the money box as carefully as they hide their distinctive places, can we really live quietly and carefreely with ordinary people?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am the son of Anthony Hopkins," said Little Hopkins. "Even if I drain all the blood from the blood vessels, all the organs are replaced and removed." The fact that the skin, shaving hair, can't be changed. There is always one day, those people will find me. And before they find me, as an 'ordinary person', I am likely to be insulted, hurt, murdered by others. It is very likely that it is a murder, (he refers to his face). Many sex offenders and metamorphosis love to die, especially when his body is not strong enough, his temper is weak, his reaction is slow and he is naive and naive. Next - no, don't say that you will protect me, I believe that you will protect me, but unfortunately, your protection is weak, and there are loopholes, from 'small town' to 'Babel Tower'... eight years ago you Spare no effort to do things Prove my original vision." Sasha put out a finger in time and put it on Catherine's lips: "No, I don't want to blame you, Catherine, although I really don't have those so-called 'Ordinary people' contact, but I can also understand them by other means - also know you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The object of your pity also includes yourself, you scorn And hate yourself - you envy those who have a rich childhood and a warm family, those 'normal people' - but you are special, you are a power, you think you must be higher than others - both The distance between you cuts you into two people like a pair of scissors. You feel pain. They torture you so that you can't sleep all night, so you can only pity, even if you know that those people are not worthy of pity. But when you have pity on them, you are standing in the position of a charity invisibly. You are a noble, a queen, a god of omnipotence, and you are satisfied...but you find that you can’t get what you want. When you return, you will be angry again. Often, because you think you are paying more than enough. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So you will blame me and think that I am ungrateful - according to your standards, yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will not do what you want. It is not only ridiculous, but also wrong." Sasha said: "As I said before, I will not blame you, because you are so weak, poor Catherine, you can become powerful and glorious, but you The thoughts are too confusing, and they don't match your body and ability. They are a complete tragedy." After that, he fell silent and his fingers moved away from Catherine's lips. Capricorn her skinny can clearly touch the neck of the blood vessels and bones, Little Hopkins recalls what he saw when he walked into the kitchen - Catherine leaned against the window, the smoke spewed out like an artificial morning He is entangled in her. She was only wearing a twilight sling pajamas, and her bare shoulders were like a shelf of meat-colored leather – she was so thin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The blood between us is destined that I can't treat you like other people, I will help you to the extent possible - just like now. Catherine, you don't have to worry about the guests in 'Tianqiu' - because that's my fault, my crimes." Sasha whispered, "Put everything on me. Children, and the elderly." - You have used the ability, but you just want to make them quiet, you don't want them to hurt themselves, and it is me who eventually kills them. It is my strengthening effect - Catherine. So maybe you can sleep well." He said, and then stood up, Sasha has been growing tall for the past two years. When he stood, he needed to bow his head to see Catherine's face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine looked up, her face was awkward, she moved her lips, and the voice was very weak, as if she would disappear into the air at any time: "... I don't mean that...I...not..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't matter if it is not." Sasha said carelessly: "There must be someone to bear Responsibility, not you. It is me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha walked out of the kitchen, he Without going back to the room he shared with Besib, Anthony Hopkins was waiting for him in his room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After talking with your aunt?" I don’t know when I got up, but the well-dressed Big Hopkins said happily: "She reacted How?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no pain in life," Sasha said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Great." Big Hopkins said that he went back to his previous seat and concentrated on a wooden church organ model. "I think she will be quiet for a while."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She may change." Sasha said: "Just don't know where to go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It doesn't matter which way, she is too bad to be worse." Anthony Hopkins opened a switch, the organ model raised a small antenna, he made several in the air around the model The movement, an indescribable monotonous voice, came out: "A Taylor Mingqin from the 1940s (Note 1), a small gift from Sean Battier."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought Sean Battier would be very busy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is a polite and thoughtful person," Hopkins The doctor lazily dials the strings that are invisible to the naked eye. The sound of Taylor Minqin is very strange. It sounds like someone is hitting your heart with a small hammer. They often Used to voice the sci-fi film: "If you are worried about the 'Tianqiu' guest," he sighed for a while: "'Northern 佬' Ivan and Green Eyes* are the culprit, 'institution' will solve for him The remaining half, the last little tail can be solved by money and another... some solutions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha made a small face:" If the person who wins today is Ivan and Green Eye*, then the culprit is Sean Battier and 'Red Hair' Judah."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Right Extreme."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A disassembled card was randomly thrown onto the carpet - no matter what kind of gambling, cheating is the only way to guarantee victory - Anthony Ho Pukins has always been a cheating master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(To be continued)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ps:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;There was a significant deletion of the changes, so it was slow... sorry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to the many rewards of the heart of the corrupt heart, the big rabbits, the splendid fire, the savage of the mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
