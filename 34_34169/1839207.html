Pope." Sasha replied without raising his head: "If your question is related to the homework of today's literature class, Besib, I suggest you choose John Dorn."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because his work is the shortest?" Besib asked with hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because his work is the most..." Sasha indulged for a few seconds and chose a more appropriate word: "It’s elusive." Then I looked at Doube in disbelief. "It has nothing to do with the length, but I can't expect a child who can't understand the singularity, the stagnation, the stagnation, the stagnation, the stagnation, the stagnation, the stagnation, and the sorrow." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The scorn in this sentence is too much to be fried for dinner." Besib said: "I just don't bother to remember too much with my life. "It doesn't matter at all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Poor child." Avery said with gloating on the side: "You haven't found out that this is your next four years. "All of life?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is said that South Bend University has enrolled a boy whose IQ is only around 80, because he is skilled, but I don't think I need a football star to take care of his business than Mr. Sandy." Sasha's finger tapped on the keyboard: " Ten thousand touchdowns may not save a wrong investment. He will be very upset."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The sonnet can't."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really not, but it can save your homework and credits," Sasha said. "Let your heart and courage, Besib, you look now Like a coward - lyrics are not terrible, it won't eat you... well, look at this. John Donne's praise to the Father (he whispers) - who can forgive me from the past Sin? I have repented for them,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I still commit it now, can you forgive me? You have never forgiven me because I am still guilty. I am inciting others to sin, can you forgive me? I have restrained the sin for a year or two, but I have been indulging in it for many years. Can you forgive me? You have never forgiven me because I am still guilty. I only have fear, even if I spit out the silk, I still can't make atonement. If you can give it to the express. I promise you not to say that your son is guilty after death, then I am not afraid. Because you really forgive me. . "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib is stunned: "It...like...I mean, is it a little long..." he stuttered and said: "The Madonna testified." . Even if tomorrow is the end of the world, I can't imitate it to write the so-called poems. Are you simple? For example..." He searched for a sentence or two, but he could only remember that he was like a fruit tree transplanted by the stream, and the leaves were not dying according to the season. Everything he did was going well! A sentence such as (Bible. Psalms). It was often heard and remembered when he listened to the priest's sermons.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because it is John. "Well," said Sasha. "In the three stages of the representative, John Donne is the most original, and his ambiguity and mystery make it difficult for people to understand him better. He is He wrote many love songs and satirical poems in his youth, and he was married. After a full decade, and then awakened in a morning, abandoned the marriage and converted to the embrace of God. At the same time, his passion and enthusiasm for writing love poems has also been transferred to religious poetry. The 17th century hymns and other forms of religious poetry in the Western Continent are more religious than poetic. So sometimes he is not so particular about poetry rhythm. In comparison, Ben Jonson is a classicist, and the ideas in poetry are not bound. The format is quite conservative, and Pope's poetry has been blamed for rigidity - I don't think anyone expects you to be their successor overnight. But I think if it's just a homework, you can still become a 'child of Dorn' (meaning the person who inherits his style), you can show the uneven rhythm and the ambiguous rhythm to everyone. Dorn sometimes does this too, although he does it on purpose, and you are... I mean, you can make it look not so bad. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishb is stunned by Sasha. He has already turned his head.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃"I think, Hopkins means," Avery said cautiously. "You can make it." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishb looked at him and turned to see his pale blond hair friend.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The sadness of a sudden sudden rise came from the heart of Little Hopkins: "Yes, Besib," he affirmed with pain: "You can make it."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is just a joke. In the first few months, Avery thought that Hopkins would help Besib do his homework or cheat on the exam, but then he found himself Big mistakes, Hopkins is excellent, Bessib is not a fool, he just because the foundation of the previous years is too weak, so it will be hesitant at the beginning, but as long as he seized the study The opportunity and embarrassment, like swimming, boxing and shooting, he quickly understood how to get a good grade and get the most useful things from the teacher - his math, physics, chemistry in Hopkins' guidance It’s getting better and better. Compared with the same class, the foreign language is also good (he has a good brain that never forgets). The only thing that can make him hurt is only literature and music, especially those who need imagination and sensibility. Part of him, he is not good at poetry There is no way to distinguish the notes hidden emotions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a little surprised by this little Hopkins, because in his impression, the right brain lobe of a person who has the ability to deform and phagocytosis should be enough Rich and full (it is responsible for maintaining the appearance of the space and processing it) until he remembers that the amoeba (Amoeba) is a single-celled creature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib has no knowledge of the shackles that only exist in the mind. He stares at the computer screen and knocks a word for a few minutes. After more than two hours, I wrote a so-called poem with a taste like chewing wax. There are a lot of people with a clear eye who know that it belongs to a certain section of the Bible, but he did his best, and this is a religious poem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avery is also busy doing his homework during this time. He is a tenth grader, his homework is more arduous, and he is squatting after completing a subject. The head carefully looked at Hopkins. Hopkins is never entangled in homework and exams. He rarely uses computers to access documents and materials online. His brain is like a large, world-wide library. He just sits there with his hands. Putting on the keyboard, the papers and exercises will appear on the white screen as fast as the self-proliferating virus. He finished his homework two hours ago, and now he is looking at a big colorful album. From Avery's point of view, he can see the cover and the back cover. The cover is dark red. of. In the black words, Petru Campbell, Avery remembers the book, and the teacher he chose in the art class mentioned and asked them to read it in detail - Petru is a painter and anatomist. He invented a method for measuring the angle of a person's face from a side image. This method is called the first widely used face scale measurement system, which can be used to identify skull differences between different races, but this method The original intention is indeed to quantify the nature of beauty, and Petru has taken the Greek statue as an ideal example of human beauty - the greater the angle. The more beautiful it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among his measurements, Africans are farthest from “beauty” and Europeans are closest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now Hopkins is using a brief method provided by the author to measure his facial angle, he raises his palm in front of his face, his thumb presses his chin And the index finger is against the forehead. He gathered two fingers, flipped his palms and changed to touch his ears and lips. It’s full of excitement and interest – his appearance is very different from that of four years ago, and the masculine charm disappears. Instead, it is a beauty that should only belong to a book or a male figure, but because he is still growing. The reason. This kind of beauty is a bit confusing, people are watching him. It’s hard to imagine how he really grew up,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishb sits next to Hopkins, as we said last time, Poseidon The future "Tang" of the island is much more white than a year ago. His skin color is olive-colored, dark brown eyes, the natural twisted hair is shortly trimmed, the cheekbones are prominent, and the muscles of the lower jaw are particularly developed. Avery and Sashaga are also stronger and more powerful. When he runs on the "barbeque", he is reminiscent of a bull that is irritated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coach of the football team is applying to the school to make this ninth grade an official member of the football team. This is really embarrassing, Avery is The first half of the tenth grade became an official member, and it was considered special. For this reason, Avery’s parents also opened a special celebration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before this, there were several senior girls who stared at the boy who was said to be from a remote island. He was not as perfect as Hopkins and Hopkins. Nothing, but he is wild and strong, very consistent with... their fantasies - quiet, a little lonely - this is especially safe, the girls are extremely disgusted with the boy who talks about every detail of the date. However, many people can't help but do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under their comparison, Avery feels a bit pitiful, he has not received chocolate, but there are only black squares inside, no A color card with a name and phone number, a public comment on a small note of love and a date request. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avery is not ugly, and the muscles that have been exercised after entering the football team are tight and the limbs are slender, but his face is always round. It looks so cute - girls are rarely willing to date with "cute" boys. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their sights fell more on Besib, Bissance, Sasha Hopkins, and Boa Douglas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
