			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost at the same time, another pair of fathers and sons are holding their arms around each other and leisurely walking on the streets of Grande town with sharp corners. The road that has been used for hundreds of years has been polished, the sun shines on it, the stone shines like a copper coin; the center of the street has two deep dents, which are left by the carriage. The ruts of the ruts, on either side of them, are the shadows cast by the awnings of the shops. There are two or three floors of houses in the town of Grande. The residents have large and small shops on the ground floor of the house. One, all kinds, all-inclusive - velvet sofa, white marble square table and small coffee shop with aluminum counter, family style with wormwood and candy cane in a round glass bowl Grocery store, dressed as a pink cake shop, in the floor-to-ceiling window with a portrait of a male model or a female model (they usually only wear a pair of jeans that are falling low to fall under the knee); Two to three electronic products franchise stores, This surface has a quarter in the latest style of music / video player, mobile phone or tablet ...... In short, a fourteen to eighteen-year-old boy or girl want and need, all here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most is the bookstore, some of them are spacious and bright, the air is fresh, and some are just the opposite, you can find the famous opponents of Stephen? A book about the special theory of relativity, or a nude, "Bunny" magazine that is honest with your page... I am happy with you. The family members are more diverse and unique, and if you want, you can sort out as many as Balzac (Note 1). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of them is sitting at the door of his shop, and the sparkling eyes are eagerly looking at everyone passing by him. The bookstore’s store is not very good. Wide, everyone who wants to go in and have to go in his knees. This small store has not yet closed down so far. It is a blessing for a distantly distant relative. The latter can always select good and cheap goods from the unsalable goods of the container. There are new and old books, or Famous, or obscure, but the books themselves can be summed up in the "valuable" ranks - sometimes the administrators of the Grand School Library will come here to pick books. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thick and thin books are roughly divided into categories, arranged one on top of the shelf, you can pick them yourself, pay after you pick them up. Money, the boss’s feet are throwing a small box. He stuffed the money in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A pair of black, soft, cotton-like lambskin shoes stopped in front of the bookstore window, and the same color trousers were folded neatly. The boss looked at the person from under the erect eyebrows - an older man, thin, tall, shirts white, gray-blue eyes were delicate. The black titanium steel feet are covered by glasses, his nose is as pointed as a bird's beak, and with a little hook, his lips are brighter than the woman who wiped the lipstick - he turned his head and smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you please show me this book? Sir," he said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can walk in and take it out. How do you look at how to look at it?" The boss said, he moved his body in awe, letting him say: "I am here." The book is nothing precious. It’s just like watching everyone like it – do you like that book too? Sir, I think the cover is still very good, so I put it in the window.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Isn't it?" Anthony Hopkins said that he walked into the bookstore and that the book's unique ink and paper smells. The dust in the sun is filled. His son followed him like a sly puppy, silently purple. Curious eyes stared at the book—there was a slobbered golden lip on the cover, and the saliva flowed to the lower half of the cover pink, with a set of ghostly swashes on the top. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Andra’s joke," Sasha said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, but this is the native language version, Andra wrote and published this article in his hometown, three consecutive editions, one rushed away - It’s amazing, some people noticed him and the book, and this time Andra could be downcasted – who told him to talk something less interesting? The authorities insisted that he was insinuating Confusing a great regime, his book is classified as **, not allowed to buy or sell, and not allowed to collect. He himself is deprived of the right to work and free to breathe fresh air. - I have been looking for this version, the first language "It's completely different from the second language," Dr. Hopkins said softly. "You can read it after dinner, don't be influenced by political words that seem to swear by it - in fact, it's a stupid big The boy wants revenge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you." Sasha said that he has grown a lot in the past six months, approaching his father and giving him a A loud kiss is not difficult at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh," said the Ghoul. "A really good price, good quality kiss, dear," he said. "You have to pay for it." What should I do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can pick a few more books for me," Sasha said. "And dinner, although the squid will not be until October. Yes, but the goose is also very delicious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But then I am a little lost," Anthony Hopkins said: "Re-send I am a kiss, I can give a handful of bitterness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun shines through the glass window, and the book is illuminated by it, soft and soft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is less than two and a half feet between the bookshelf and the bookshelf. This size will make most people feel ashamed, and light and dust will pile up on top of a row of closely spaced books. A few books because the customer hastily left or is irresponsible, so the 14-inch book that was not put back in the house tilted to the body, hanging in the air, just like the trees sticking out its branches, the big Hopkins passing them They will stretch out a finger and push them back in place - Sasha Hopkins stayed in place, he found a decorative wooden ladder, sat down with his knees, and concentrated on the original. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the boss’s memory, there is such a painting that makes him memorable. The content and meaning of the picture have long been thrown into the clouds. The name has also been forgotten, the only thing I can remember is the characters in the painting, the bright blond hair and the rosy cheeks, the innocent gesture and the gentle and happy look - let people feel relaxed and happy. - Now this living painting is in front of his eyes. He no longer cares about the rare pedestrians on the street, but is full of thoughts about sitting on a teenager who is less than five feet away from him. The boss also has two sons, but for him, it is two noisy, upset bunny scorpions, since they broke away from the hustle and bustle, they have not let their old father save the day's heart - it is simply two columns From the locomotive that didn’t stop, it rumbled over and rumbling through – taking away beef sandwiches, orange juice, milk, money, cars and clothes, leaving a smog of smoke and dust. They never sat quietly in the sun to read a book for a while, and rarely kissed their old dad, or "thank you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If someone I made them into a movie, and I felt that it was too fake." The boss said in his heart, "Where is this beautiful and gentle child?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp Perhaps they are not fathers and sons, the boss thinks this way, but he immediately denies himself - just because he is also a father, the child is lingering between the body and the demeanor, sweet and concealed tacit understanding, he still Can be distinguished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought of the gods, when Dr. Hopkins came to him, he could not help but be shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Light is like a cat." The boss whispered, flipping through the book: "Twenty yuan, sir."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins paid the money, and Sasha stood up, took the book, and clipped it under the armpit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doctor looked slightly over the line of sight and looked at his own child. The boy who had already entered the boyhood was full of life, clean and beautiful, like a piece of white blush. The green hills covered by flowers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps only he can see the undercurrent hidden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is Besib?" Hopkins asked straightforwardly while waiting for the starter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sashaton paused, "Not bad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But you are always upset. Hopkins said: "And not very happy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I..." The boy’s face showed a hesitant look: " I just don't know what to do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is nothing," Anthony Hopkins said calmly: "This stage is inevitable - you Did he find that he became a little impulsive, violent, and even a little stupid? He made up classes, reading, exams, playing rugby, bathing and eating, just like the other 170 boys in Grandli, he was changing, Fix yourself, you feel that he has become a bit different from Besib. Bissand? You want to stop, want to interrupt this but don't know what to do - because he is still Besib, this is his Choice, his emotions, his life, you can't force yourself in, because he is your friend, and you know that the foundation of friendship is respect.<b r /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You respect his choices, even if his choices make you deeply fearful.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, you It’s not just Besib, but also yourself... my child, you are changing, you have a lot of things that are no longer belonging to that 'Sasha Hopkins.' Your life. No longer purely you and me - you can't get used to it, you feel that you are becoming weak, slow, and vulnerable," he said, lovingly touching the child's eyebrows across the table: "Why, dear? You I had to be separated from me because of the power of the outside world. You are not afraid of pain, and you are never worried about injury or even death. You have been brave and fearless, and you are unshakable. What is it that makes you tremble with fear?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
