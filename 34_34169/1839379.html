[Book by] - The Bible <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the first time, and Stefan is often unstable at night in Stronga. The dream and the white shackles came to this bright and magnificent sanctuary, but it was not long after he realized that it was not on the ground, the temple built by mankind - he went to see the earth. The sanctuary, on the hill of Moria, the one built by Solomon, although only the ruins are left, but people can find its mark and traces from the Bible - 3,600 supervisors, 70,000 people responsible for the bar Lifting, 80,000 people are responsible for carving the required stone, and Solomon’s father David prepared gold, silver, copper, iron and their vessels as much as the rock that was excavated, as well as the riverside As much gravel as agate, gems and colored stones; and, 50,000 pounds of gold, 100,000 pounds of silver, for the craftsmen to wrap the olive wood door frame, the cedar threshold, attached to the wall of the sanctuary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the arks of the ark and the mercy seat, the lampstands in the sanctuary, the bowls, the tables and the cakes, the cakes, the bronze altars and baptisms in the outer courts Pots. Br < br 哎 哎 哎 哎 哎 哎 哎A stone is still above the stone, and it was dismantled by the Romans to find the gold that melted in the cracks of the stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, he was still a ignorant child. Although he held the Bible in his hand, he only had the fake god on the ground. He thought he was The punishment is dirty, unclean, except for Strang Jacob, the outside people are devils and beasts - a devout truck driver forced him to a small church and handed it to the priest. That is his baptism and mentor, where he was re-baptized correctly. Education and guidance - but even so, he can only recognize that the saint Jared is not the father of the earth after six years, he is just a mortal, and is harassed by the devil. His feet stood on the ground and had stretched out half to the bitter purgatory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He described his dreams to the priest who was like his father in the seventh year. He thought it was just a child based on the only words in the Bible. In the fantasy scene, when he was still young, he and the "teacher" said this thing, in exchange for a good meal, and three days of vigil and fast, simply said that there is no food, no bed . There are only 72 hours of clear water and prayer. Since then, he has locked his "fantasy" or dreams into his heart, closing his mouth, and no one said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike the teachers of Strongman, the priest believed him—Stifan described him as warm as the sun. Air-clear, golden-like steps; lifted them are white, more pure and flawless than alabaster, pillars of jade and pearls. I can't see the end of the stairs extending upwards, and I stretched into the bright void. There are no handrails on either side of the steps. The steps are black like the vortex that swallowed the whole world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what he dreamed of for the first time. Then this dream lasted for several years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it always the same?" The priest patiently listened to Stefan, who was already an adult at the time, intermittently and silently. I asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stefan was silent for a while, because he didn’t know if he should say it, in the inner page of the black-skinned Bible that he carried with him. Recording the number of dreams with tiny black dots, others seem to be just a string of rules. Unremarkable black spots, even if it is recognized that it is not part of the book decoration, it will only be regarded as a boring move for a young person. He showed the priest the little bible, which had more than a hundred black spots on it, and the appearance of the dream was irregular. When he was a child, it was only once a year, but as he grew older, the number of dreams became more frequent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He first squatted at the end of the ladder, and the second time he tried to climb up, the steps were smooth and there was no place to grasp. And he is still a child, it is logical, even in the dream, he still fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feeling of falling is quite terrible, but when he dreams of this ladder again, the boy who was still happily did not hesitate to once again He used to climb up - he felt the call, it was a call that could not be defiant and made people unable to defy - he kept on, the clean and fragrant water fell from the sky, soothing his thirsty soul and body The flowers are open in the air, the sacred music and hymns are played in the distance, and the more refreshing and pleasant atmosphere than * and myrrh is as gentle as the mother's womb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He fell down again and again, but on the night of re-baptism, he finally climbed to the top, almost only to accommodate the next person At the other end of the standing platform is a huge arch that is more beautiful, sturdy and wide and taller than all the doors he has seen before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is closed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood on the platform, about the time of blinking his eyes, the platform disappeared, and he fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next few years, he has been trying to push the door open, but the door always keeps him out, is this Tell him that because of the crimes he had committed before, he could not be forgiven and could not enter the temple of the Lord in heaven. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't think so," the priest looked at him gently and with some blame: "The Lord of Glory will not give his wisdom and revelation." Come on a sinner - he summoned you, there must be sake."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That night, the ladder appeared again in front of Stefan, he Climbing upwards is faster and more stable than ever before. When he is standing in front of the door, "Please give me my work!" He shouted from the heart: "I will Finish it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant door opens. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw the pool of silver, too big to see the margins, the water in the pool is as clear as ever; there is an altar made of bronze, able to Let the angels fill all the things that humans can eat; go inside again, he saw the gold lampstand, with six branches on each side, shaped like flowers, as well as scissors, plates, and placed * The table with the myrrh is pure gold. The back of the ceremonial table and the lampstand are two olive trees with jade leaves and a white cloud-like account. Covered with a simple, wood-made cabinet with a gold ring hanging from the corners above it. There is a pair of angels who face each other with their own wings to cover the mercy seat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stefan suddenly realized that he had the privilege of coming to a place of loftiness and glory. He crouched on the ground and kissed the ground with his lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is crouching, sincere, not tired, not hungry, all the pain in the world has gone away from him - until a small The little hoof appeared in front of his eyes, and Stefan looked up and saw a pair of curious eyes. Then he saw the thin, rounded, curled hair that resembled the first sun, two small horns on the head, and a small short tail that was smashed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗄. It was really a mischievous little thing. Before Stefan hadn't figured out what it was all about, it was in the sacred hall, and it ran away and jumped onto the table. , sniffing the end of the *, was spurred by a series of dozens of sneezes. I got those precious spices everywhere, and when I squatted down the table, I smashed the thick leaves of the olive trees with the newly grown horns on my head, and jumped into the silver pool and jumped out. Wetly slammed a few rolls in the account, and Stefan just wanted to catch it. It turned the wooden cabinet over the head, the door of the cabinet opened, and the jar of gold rolled away, and the white seeds contained in it were scattered - two slate dangerously When he received his arms, he still couldn’t stand up. I saw that the daring lamb was smelling the sprouting cane and seemed to be interested in the buds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stefan yelled in unbearable, almost immediately, and he woke up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next few days, he seems to have a snack, he noticed that the priest was paying attention to him, but he really didn’t know what to say— - Is it really the revelation of the Lord when you say something? A lamb is messing up in his temple, and he is in need of a man to catch it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After two consecutive days, he returned to the temple, where it did not seem to have been looted by a demonic lamb, or He recovered - he didn't know, he only knew that if he stayed for a while, the lamb would run out and mess with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lambs seem to have seen his chasing and sipping as a fun game. If it is an individual, Stefan will definitely hear him. Big laughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stefan’s hard work continued until he graduated from the seminary, about the war between him and the lamb, who did not say anything, including the priest, you Teach him what to say... Ah, I have received the revelation of the Lord of Glory, just to drive a little lamb from love to his temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take the big but light, empty door again, and Stefan’s accident is that the little devil is standing quietly in front of the altar. It was like waiting for him - he looked around in panic, the lampstand was good, the spices on the table were good, the ark and the account were good... everything was fine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His heart is involuntarily filled with joy, "You finally changed your mind," he said seriously to the lamb, just like facing one Man: "May my Lord bless you - I think he should forgive you, as long as you don't do those evil things..." He said cheerfully: "He will forgive you, although you can't regret it. You can't pray, but as long as you are willing to do good... he can see."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lamb looked up at him, he already knew that the lamb had a pair Beautiful eyes, but today he can see their shape and color, they are like a pair of almonds, light golden eyelashes are covered on it, the iris is deep cobalt blue, like the depths of the Great Lakes, with Green light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It screamed, this is the first time it screamed, even if it was caught by the tail, it was pulled out by the angry Stefan It has not been called by the mane - it is a sad and solemn cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
