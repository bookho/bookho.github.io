			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why is this island called Polufimo?" Besib asked: "Because it was once inhabited by giants?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha still has a chance to answer in the future, they have a voice behind them, a man’s voice: "If you want to know," he said: "The best way is to see it with your own eyes." A glance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One side of the yacht deck stands a man - it looks like a flower buddy who is still the best at the best age. When he came over here, the sea breeze blew his soft brown hair. The end of the hair was brushed white by the sea breeze and the sunlight. His eyes were light brown. This color has always been difficult. Defined, some people call them tan, and some people think that this is the middle color of brown and green - perhaps because of the relationship on the ship, he did not wear shoes, but bare feet, relative, he The clothes on the body are meticulous, and the shirt inside is like a deep blue sea. Jacket and pants are white, he stretched out his hand to seize the railing, a diamond ring in white hot issue on his little finger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Chenneck, accompanied by Sasha and Besib, showed a pleasant look: "It really surprised me," he greeted the man. The two embraced joyfully: "How come you are on this boat?" He said cheerfully: "Don't say it is to meet us - then we have to be flattered."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why not?" The man said, "You are my old friend, and now it is to solve my hardships." He looked at Sasha and looked at it. Besib: "Tell me, which of the two children was lucky enough to be selected by Muse? Or both?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Both are - that's really wonderful, sorry, Gregory," said Neek to Hopkins nodded. "It's a blond-haired child, Sasha Hopkins. He I am only fifteen years old this year, but I have been playing the plucked piano for eight years. You can listen to his performance. His fingers are blessed by the Holy Spirit."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I believe in you." Gregory said that he took a few steps forward until he was less than a foot away from the two children. He seriously looked at them - two boys The dark-skinned one looks like a descendant of fishermen in the West Sea, deep olive eyes, and a pair of strangely shaped brown frame glasses that are inserted into the thick, curly hair. He smiled at Gregory's line of sight, with a hard-to-tamed temper and a special, indifferent taste. The muscles are not as bright as the adults, but they are clearly recognizable. They are almost all over the body, wearing only a white boxer, which is tightly wrapped around the juvenile that is not yet fully developed but quite For the eye-catching lower body. “The outlook can be expected.” Gregory thought in his heart, “A piece of black coal, finely polished, can be fascinating.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He then turned his attention to another boy, who was conservative compared to his companion. Shirts, trousers, leather sandals, shirts and trousers are also linen, but they are natural. Leather sandals are dark gold, rare colors, but very compatible with his platinum-like hair color, the sun shines on his hair, and glows. He is like a real diamond crown - that is not the effect of artificial stains - his eyes are purple, an actress also had violet eyes fifty years ago. She is a rare treasure in the world of cinema. The rare eyes of the two colors make countless people fascinated by it. The influence continues all the way to the present. Her clothes, jewelry, photos, and movie copies are auctioned and collected. Her home is It was converted into a museum with all the things related to her, ranging from one-half lipstick to a camper that can sit eight people. The boy’s eyes are more diverse than her. Rich and more moving, his eyes are pure and calm, innocent and innocent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His skin is smooth, delicate and fair, his body is slender and his hands and feet are small. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is like a fireball with light, and a breeze through your body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Great." Gregory murmured: "It's so perfect... Say something, let me hear your voice, boy ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh. Gregory, converge, you have to scare the children." Chennike shook his head and caught up, "Don't Worried," he said to Besib: "Gregory always does," he explained to Hopkins: "He is not malicious, just an occupational disease - Gregory is an acting agent, he is sensitive. Especially looking for the gemstone that has never been polished." He turned to face Gregory: "But Hopkins can't, can only borrow, can't sell it - otherwise his coach And the teachers will tear me apart. He has been another good student who has probably graduated with a full grade in the past 100 years. They are eager to apply for a successful top ten university. Of course, the top three are even better." He finished his breath and took out his handkerchief and gently wiped the sweat. "I am sorry," he said, and there was no shortage of words. Yao Zhiyi: "He has been discovered by us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's a pity," said Gregory, close, his The sound sounds clearer, and the place where it feels contradictory is becoming more and more prominent - he is like talking in his throat: "Children, you will make two-thirds of the world's people crazy for you." ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins smiled indifferently. He never thought about becoming a "playing trick," and Besib shook his head, whether it was Anthony Hopkins or Chegaler. I am not happy to see my son running on the screen to wink and wink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You really don't want to try?" Gregory said that he knew that the two children had a birth, but he thought it was not a problem - the Carson family It’s not the old family that has been stretching for thousands of years on the western continent. They started at the beginning of this century, and they started out with a financial turmoil that swept the world. They are not strong enough and lack the essence: “There is everything you want, you can do whatever you want, it’s hard to count. The person will kneel at your feet and ask for a glimpse." He seducely, the sound is like a silk thread: "A short-term? How, as long as three years, play nature, you are free, you love to continue You can do it or not." But he will let the child want to stop... Gregory believes in his ability and vision. The wonderful thing is that when he looks at the photos, he only thinks that it is just a beautiful child. After seeing the real person, I realized that the difference between the two is too far. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just want to know," Sasha said. "You just said that the best way is to see it with your own eyes. Can you answer this question for us?" ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound is also qualified, Gregory looks at him, oh, a boy, a child, he knows them too, the agent puts down his shoulders "Okay, if you are really not interested," he said: "We can talk about something else, such as Polufimo."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly turned Passed over, raised his arm and snapped a finger. The crew, who had been waiting for the distance, immediately smashed his body and plunged into the cabin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait a minute," he said to Chenneck. "How about lemon soda first?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope there are two gallons, plus rum raisin ice cream," said Neec. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And your favorite peach," said Gregory, then turned to two boys. "What do you want?" He looked nothing like that, and the ardent invitation seemed to never exist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mint and vanilla." Sasha said, "The latter adds some olives."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Fruits, sodas and ice creams were quickly brought up. They just picked up the spoon and heard a roar of faint screams in the distance. A seaplane with colorful wings appeared on the edge of the blue sky. Gradually from small to large, the yacht slowed down and got anchored. It glides slowly on the water and stops at about sixty feet from the yacht. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two orange, huge sacs hold the plane, and the people above open the door and drop the anchor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they enjoyed the ice cream and fruit slowly, the crew prepared the dinghy, and Mr. Neek refused the glorious invitation of Gregory. When he is old, his heart is not very good. He would rather follow the boat and sway to the island. Glegri, Besib and Sasha took a small boat, the boat was close to the seaplane, Gregory went up first, then two teenagers, and Sasha saw the thin white waves slap the buoy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The engine drives the propeller, pushing the fuselage on the float, the seaplane begins to lightly slide, its speed is getting faster and faster, finally getting rid of the sea Bonded, rushed to the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plane rose to a certain height, and Gregory signaled the boys to look down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, I understand," Besib said: "No wonder it will be called this name."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha did not know why the name of this private island was in Besib, because in the legend of Poseidon Island, the earliest place to live is the Cyclops, and there are many reef groups in Poseidon Island. More than one is closely related to Polyphemus - not the flock of Polyphemus, the bed of Polyphemus, or the firewood of Polyphemus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why this island is called Polyphymo has nothing to do with the place of residence, its name comes from its shape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking down from the plane, the island floating on the blue sea of ​​gems is round, the green trees above are lush, that is the blue iris The iris is surrounded by a circle of milky white sand, and the beach is further out. It is the part of the island that is submerged under the sea. The fish-shaped light reef is evenly distributed with dark seaweed and coral, and the shape is like human white. Common shadows and blood vessels on the membrane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a building in the center of the island shaped like an inverted pyramid, and the facilities around it were gray and looked like a height It is a black pupil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The miracle of nature creation," Sasha said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is that?" Besib asked, "What are the grey houses?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;</div>
