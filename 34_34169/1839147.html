			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Streif’s dinner was one hour late today, but before that, Sasha got a small bowl of sweet and sour spears as an extra starter. Streif baked a small piece of bread for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a child, these are enough, but when the succulent lettuce and the fried shrimps with cheese and tasty sauce are served on the table He couldn’t help but eat a bit, but he ate some more, but he didn’t move the lamb chops, but the blueberry frozen milk cake that came up last time was too appetizing for him (although it only had two or three The weight of the spoon is only), so when the late dinner is over, Sasha feels a little... slight indigestion - this little trouble doesn't need to prescribe, but the full stomach draws a big Part of the blood is for digestion, and the mind is inevitably insufficient. Sasha's eyelids are pulled down, and the head covered with golden brown fur is staggering on the shoulders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Streif gathered the cutlery and piled it into the kitchen sink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha almost fell asleep before being wrapped in a warm, fluffy bath towel. Streiff took a mouthwash: "Drink a bite," he said. "But don't swallow it, tens of times, then spit it out." The spicy taste of the mint mouthwash made Sasha sober for a few seconds, but very Soon, he was stuffed into a thick, thick blanket. They held him like a hot cloud. The child closed his eyes happily, relaxed, and the hair that had been sucked in was still wet. His The face tilted slightly to one side, and the breath was soft and almost inaudible. Streiff sat on the edge of the bed, waiting quietly, listening, waiting for the child's breathing to stabilize - he crouched down and let his ears cling to the small chest of Sasha through a blanket, he It is clear that the egg-sized heart is beating vigorously, oh, oh... The child's abundant heat is emitted from under the blanket and penetrates into his skin and blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, Sasha," he said quietly and cheerfully: "Sasha."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The child rubbed his teeth in his sleep, and Shasha had this bad disease. This problem was even worse during the tooth change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steffef looked up and he thought about it for a while, making the light darker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked out of the room, no sound at all, the tableware in the kitchen sink consumed some time, but not long after, at least in Straffe to clean himself When sitting in a small study room and adding brandy to hot coffee, time is not too late for an adult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The small study is located on the first floor and has a double-glazed, framed glass floor-to-ceiling door that opens onto the garden, but now it is tightly closed. Looking through the black wooden frame around the glass, you can see a marble fountain for storing water, surrounded by a large canopy that grows to a completely out of control wood hibiscus, pink, or red flowers in the night wind. Trembling, the two bull terriers slept under the sparsely messy stalks and leaves. They didn't sleep very well. They would scratch their faces every other moment and make a jet from the nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Street is sitting in a chair, he bought it from an auction, a small armchair with embroidered The sleeve, the dark green cover edge is a bit worn, but it can be seen that the person who sewed it used a big thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not turn on the lights, and the darkness did not hinder him. The mixture of coffee and brandy is full of nose, but not long after, other odors in the study are also involved - wet soil, bluegrass planted in the mud, books with locusts, new and old paintings, The smell of wood, cloth and leather on the ceiling and walls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two hours ago, things rushed like the tide rising under the gravity of the moon, he carefully sorted and picked them in the brain, and those The useful things are sorted out, and they do it every day, so that they don’t have to be used for the time--very suddenly, the swamp that is tumbling under the golden light is distorted, it emits an unimaginable smell. The gas, at the same time, became dark and deep, and it gradually became the cellar - stop, Streif said to himself, stopped, but he could not grasp it, the lid of the mantle opened, and the things hidden inside were accompanied. The smell of the corpse-like fermentation squirmed and overflowed - he grabbed the arm of the chair, and the hard walnut squeaked between the fingers of the madman, the criminal and the psychiatrist, Anthony Hopkins Once again, I heard the deer screaming, and the deserters ate it before eating Sasha - he was caught, the soldier was touching him, his face, arms, body, legs, and how much meat he had on him... He closed his eyes Eyes, the eyeballs swiftly under the eyelids - the ones that were taken out were Sasha, and he caught up, but the wooden door that was tightly closed broke his arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a terrible pain in the arm. The ghoul slipped down from the chair. He fell on the icy hardwood floor and a voice was talking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you not happy? They didn't pick you, you won't be killed, you are still alive, you are not being eaten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Sasha was eaten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sharp scream passed through the glass, and the bull terriers were alarmed. They stood up and looked at the source of the sound, but there was nothing black and black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Streif a little regret, maybe he should put some music, a vinyl disc on the record player, the Vienna National Radio Symphony Orchestra played in 1998 The work of Mendelssohn, which is very famous, on the surface of the record packaging, reads "Beautiful and serene melody and complete and rigorous music, the most poetic fantasy of music" - they are brisk and cheerful. Full of sunshine and stars, humorous and hoarse, they will guide him to a good place, such as in the forest park that day, he hid in the car, watching Catherine tied to the pony tail run from the path covered with fallen leaves into the woods In it, a beautiful girl who can almost endorse Valkyrie (the female god of war in Norse mythology), with strong muscles, smooth skin, sparkling radiance in her eyes, and a golden ponytail swaying over the gray hooded pullover, like It was the tail of the doe... a glimpse, a glimpse, at that time he was still her hunting target - he carefully raised the memory from the room, he entered the car of Catherine, all in the car is Catherine's Taste, he took a deep breath, he took Catherine into his lungs and took it back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He built a room for Catherine that day, far from the cellar. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woodwind instrument has made a split sound, and the rising tone of the stringed instrument set off the brass instrument to play the theme again with a grand and full of sound. Then the d adjustment under the central c appeared again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Straef reluctantly recalls the arrow that runs through Catherine’s head, exactly the same as the arrow that runs through the deer’s head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghoul curled up on the floor sideways, his cheeks pressed against the floor, and the part of the wood in front of the nose was squirted. The water droplets caused by the cold under the ground are wet, and the creamy feeling extends all the way to his cheekbones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A desire is born and spread from the bottom of his heart like the moss in the swamp. It has not appeared for a long time, with some dust and mildew. Taste, but Anthony Hopkins as a criminal is welcome - he plans to kill someone and then eat him/her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can choose Mr. Henry, they only talked, this man is very healthy and very strong, but Hopkins can catch him, God does not know I feel that Mr. Henry will go jogging along the tarmac that separates the park from the residential area every morning and morning, and snoring, he will become very tired when he turns back, if Hopkins If you like, you can grab him from the woods. At that time, there was nothing but a bird in the woods. What about the two dogs? No problem, Hopkins hiding in Streif can see that it is two cowardly ghosts with huge bodies. He found out when he first entered Henry’s courtyard, the dogs They have a strong instinct to avoid evil, they will run away, screaming on the road instead of rushing to save their owners, they may attract others into the woods, but at that time he should have cooked everything and walked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What worries the ghoul is that he can't cut the part he wants to eat as clearly as he used to, if it's a rib or a thymus, a part of the liver – it's easy for the FBI agent to produce something. Unpleasant associations - the current coroners are very smart and very careful. They will investigate whether the body is incomplete or not, and it is impossible to hide it. Or he can fake the whole thing. Wild dog attack. There are many wild dogs here, and they are fierce. In the past few years, people who fell to the ground because of poison/products or drunkenness were attacked by wild dogs and ate some body accidents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where does the wild dog like? They rarely tear apart human clothes, especially the heavy winter sweatshirts and jeans, which bite the face, hands and feet of the victim, but if the other person is open, it is another matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghoul’s pale, slender fingers crawled like a spider on the floor, the small study’s door swayed, his eyes in the dark Dark red, like the coal that the devil has picked up from hell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is open, the dark red eye first sees a group of hair that looks softer under the light, then the dark purple eyes , a little pale face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sasha?" The voice echoed in the house, hehe, like a big bee flying around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes," said the child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghoul’s body is surrounded by a dark, ominous atmosphere, but this is no big deal for Sasha. He looks calm and holds the glass in one hand. The water cup, the other hand is a fist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sasha?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am here." Sasha said, the night wind Passing through the hallway, piercing his pajamas. His neck and arms have a thin goose bump. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghoul lowered his head and reflected the shadow of Sasha in his eyes: "Hey," he said. "I am sorry, I woke you up." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't matter," Sasha said simply. "But I am a bit cold."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ghoul immediately picked him up from the ground, and the slippers were left on the floor. He held the child's foot firmly with the other hand. Sasha did not wear socks and his heels were very cold. He walked back to the study, sat in the armchair, and Sasha was placed on his knees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you want some water?" Sasha said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes," said the ghoul. "Yes, I need it." He took the cup from Sasha's hand and took a sip. Fresh mint leaves are added to the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," he said. "What else?" Sasha raised her hand and stretched out the little fist. The soft little finger touched him. Lips, the ghoul opened his mouth docilely, and a pill placed on his tongue. He closed his mouth and tasted it: "Slightly sour, a little bit of a nose, feeling like a soda, like nail polish, dear. Aripiprazole (a psychiatric medication) - good, give me two more, I think, three." He swallowed the pills and drank two more water, "Yes," he said. "Now we need to wait, are you willing to accompany me for a while?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wow," Sasha said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They just snuggled for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha can feel the chest under the body slowly (but definitely) slack, and his arms are no longer so tight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghoul’s head leaned back, the drug worked, and all the senses became a bit slow. He said, “Are you still hungry? Sasha?” The voice was like drifting from the water: “Do you need food?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was asking the Sasha? It is very likely that Sasha, who had not been able to grow his teeth, had seen her in the father’s memory, his father’s little sister, the puffy baby, the sun, the copper pot, and the purple eggplant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cellar has never been opened in front of him, but he has seen the white deciduous teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No," Sasha said calmly: "I am no longer hungry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (To be continued)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Explain here:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Hopkins is a corpse The original name of the ghost, Streif is his pseudonym. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
