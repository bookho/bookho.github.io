			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delan turned over and she slept on the floor, but given Stefan’s special favor for her, she had two excellent thick wool scorpions. Clean white sheets and soft, sun-filled silk quilt pillow, a set of white silk pajamas, touched more smooth than her skin, in her life because of pain, tired and especially long, still the first I enjoyed such a good thing; she could enjoy any kind of food and drink she thought of as she liked. She drank brandy, brandy with grilled bones, crispy chicken and chunks of beef. Sparkling wine, finally come to the cream cake and pie, can eat a piece of cheese before going to sleep, she is fat in just a few months, her face is rosy, her skin and eyes are shining, her footsteps are like a girl . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delan’s husband and she only gave birth to a daughter who was just ten years old last year but has been taken care of by her great-grandfather, she is At the end of April this year, I became the 19th wife of this old ugly man. It sounded like the top rankings, but everyone knows that the old guy’s favorite pastime is to torture his wife with all kinds of strange methods. We - he is almost ninety years old. He can't let a woman have a baby. I want the girls to cry and cry only by the soldering iron and the whip. This may be the reason why he is not tired. After all, he only I can rely on this to prove that I am still a husband and a man. Nearly half of the girls, in the second year of marrying him, were killed alive in the third year—the abandoned salt wells were their graves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DeLand does not hate and scorn her daughter like other women. On the contrary, she loves her, in the years when she was still pampered by her husband, she Always thinking of trying to get food for my daughter, Dyland is always able to eat, wear it neatly and cleanly than other girls, and do less work than others, maybe because of this . Her daughter, Little DeLan, will be seen by the stinking devil – in a group of rough-skinned, ragged girls, how small is the little Deran with an apple face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deran didn’t want to ask his husband in the past, let alone the men of Strongman. Even the women of Strang Jacobs believe that this is a good opportunity to bring glory and happiness to Little DeLand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, Hazel is back, her husband’s grandfather, Zeng Shulan, returned her to Xiao Delan. The girl is scarred, but still alive, she is now working in the sewing room. Live, embroider all kinds of subtle sacred symbols and words on the vestments of the new saints, while praying, listening to the teachings, masses, and the communion. Delan can see her, the little, lively, red-faced girl seems to be back, but her eyes are still horrified. Like a little lamb tied to four hooves, Deran knows that her physical wounds will eventually heal, but the wounds of the soul will run through her life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stefan promised that Dylan can marry someone else and stay singular, after she is old. I can live in the monastery with her mother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delland thanked her younger brother from the bottom of her heart, whether he was Stefan or Harvey. She lay on the floor outside his door, her ears pressed against the ground, and she could notice even a tiny bang in it - the nightmare tonight seemed to be extraordinarily fierce, and the time was far more than usual, the new sage shouted loudly curse. Also praying, the voice was messy and rushing, she heard him smack himself with a bitter whip, one time, another. She never thought that the sound of the whip across the air would be so heavy and sharp. This pious practice lasted for the whole dawn and dawn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derlan, who is not sleepy, sees the little gold watch he hangs on his belt, it’s already time for early prayer—not for Strange’s, It is Stefan's, he will pray before all the Strang Jacobs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door opened and Deran smelled the blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stefan looks the same as in peacetime, except that his face is paler than usual, wearing a thick linen shirt with braided wire and broken blades. Every tiny movement will bring a fresh wound. Delan will help him put on a soft cashmere robes, then serve him to wear pants, shoes, and finally the cloak that Saints Jared likes. The jacket, which was intentionally used a lot of fabrics, layered, loose, long and large, looks like the Toga of ancient Rome, the big buttons are silver or gold, with pearls or gems inlaid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every piece of clothing has been smoked by Delan. The fragrance is prepared by her. It has a strong taste and can cover the smell of blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Stefan made early prayers, Delan went out - the room of the new saint inherited from the old saint, he took this huge like a The chapel or the sacred room was changed into a three-story suite, one in a set. In essence, Delan could be said to sleep in the second, and Stefan’s bedroom was in the third. Even DeLand couldn't enter, and the outermost one was only the owner of DeLand and the room was free to enter and exit, so Deran had to go outside the room personally every morning to pick up the breakfast from the maid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stefan actually doesn’t need breakfast or dinner, he only eats one meal a day, and it’s just the bread and water in the plate, left Deran is responsible for eating them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
