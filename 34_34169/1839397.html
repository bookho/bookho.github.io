			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blanche made a red circle on the cover of Lila’s cover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lila Lee’s resume looks like nothing to watch, exactly the same as a Westernern child everywhere, but Blanche Dupont knows her The first twelve years were simply blank. Lila’s mother was a Strang Jacob. She did not follow her sect tradition and married her uncle. Instead, she chose to escape. The stupidest thing about this woman is that she In the five years after the escape, I got married with another "outside" man and gave birth to a child. This is nothing. What is surprising is that she actually believes in the sweet words of a man or woman of Stronge. With the child back to Baiyancheng, the specific situation is unknown, but she had an "accident", and her husband was "disappeared" when he rushed over. Their children were in the mines and manors in Baiyancheng. The slaves grew up in humiliation and pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She can’t see the traces of this dark history on Lila Lee’s body, Blanche thought, if it’s really something to say, That is, Lila is a girl whose psychological age is far beyond her physiological age. She is not keen on dressing and the opposite sex. Her temperament is tolerant to almost no personal emotions. There are no close female friends, but there should be a close male friend. So it should be, because Manchester also has other students from Grande who are impressed by Grande’s brunette goddess, and of course she is also a little girlfriend of Hopkins, in Besib. When they sneak up to date with different girls, they can see the two together - rarely see three people in one place at the same time, they guess, because Lila and Besib have a bad relationship . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lilla is awkward." The boy who provided the information said with a smile, "Bishb and Sasha are too close. We see Lila, not Besib, feels a little uncomfortable at the side of Sasha. Ha, no, they are not homosexual, whether it is Besib or Sasha. It is like a laser. The family of Besib is very traditional. And Hopkins... Well, he's a hard-to-describe person. Simply put, it's hard to imagine what his bare ass looks like."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Extremely accurate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why in Manchester, Besib. Bissandi is more attractive to girls than Sasha Hopkins, walking between the dormitory and the corridor. when. Just as Brian would hear the boys comment on the girls, Blanche will also receive a variety of free lists. The girls commented that the boys are more straightforward and sharper than the boys commenting on the girls. Some words they use. If some people hear it, the poor men may not be able to run back to the dormitory and cover their blankets and cry over and over again - the positive and negative evaluations of Besib. . Only a few months old, the boy has a wild, rough and handsome, tall and strong, is a strong rugby player, maybe will become the captain in the future, the results are good, and extremely generous, "he is like Adults give gifts to their girlfriends." Flowers, diamonds and suede, what the girls hate is that he made a clear statement that he would not marry any of them. And he does not pay loyalty to women other than his wife - for this he has a second nickname, the girls secretly call him "Shawen wild boar"; as for his friend, Sasha Hopkins, girl They looked at each other and they almost couldn't find the shortcomings from him. "A perfect one is similar to someone who shouldn't exist." "Does he use the bathroom?" the girls asked. Then laughed out loud and rolled out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so. Occasionally you can dance a dance, and you need to become a close friend or go further. The girls are hesitant. "It’s like a mountain," says a girl. "The closer you are, the more stress you have. To be honest, the pressure is something - we really... no more need more "She regrets to add: "And Hopkins is not the kind of approachable boy, we are coming out, he is keeping a distance from people outside Besib. Bissau, regardless of gender."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lila Lee has become somewhat alienated from Hopkins after entering Manchester, is it because this is still unknown, but the girl still has the brave . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brave is Chiz Carson. Her love for Sasha Hopkins can be heard even if she is blind, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first two years of Manchester, all students are liberal arts colleges However, they have chosen more than 2,000 courses, and in order to avoid unnecessary pressure on the next two years, they will also take some professional compulsory courses in advance for the first two years. In Manchester's special regulations, there must be 12 courses in the 36 lessons that are relevant to the student's chosen major); the other part of the course will limit the number of students enrolled, students need to apply, some professors are harsh and harsh, if he is You are only going to mix credits or for other reasons, etc. - you will be kicked out of the classroom and his line of sight without mercy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chitz Carson is the kind of student who chooses a course for other reasons. She has ten courses, eight of which are with Sasha. Pukins overlaps, and Hopkins has all the choices except science, which is not the ones that Chiz Carson is not good at. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Lila and Chiz put on the balance, Blanche is still more inclined to Chiz, Chiz and she are a group, they have Similar growth experience and family background, can also see a similar future, Chiz's deep "love" to Hopkins, let's just say this, so that Blanche is puzzled, she is not sure whether to be odd Let me talk about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Business school, law school or medical school?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Medical school." Again Brother and sister dinner time, Brian replied, as an administrator, he was able to see each freshman's elective list: ", this is the three humanities courses he chose, and his father Anthony Hopkin Sri Lanka is also a psychopathologist."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A well-known psychopathologist." Blanche said in a matter of fact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For DuPont and others who are close to him, Dr. Anthony Hopkins has already eluted his grievances, and he is a respectable And the people who trust it - although everyone knows what it is, but for them, those who are killed have nothing to do with them, and some people can return to the heirs of an ancient surname. They were happy among them - they were always amazed at why Anthony Hopkins was arrested and tried so calmly, and later they agreed that he was a bit crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be many people who are incredible. This is a modern society, a society ruled by law and fairness, but it is, blood, skin color, surname Money and power constitute this grotesque aspect. They carefully guard their own portals, carefully choose cooperative partners, friends who come and go, objects of marriage, remove unqualified blood relatives, and guard against those who are enslaved and despised by them. The "other part" is mixed in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, their external image is exactly the opposite of it. Since the king has been defeated, the civilians are keen to send the nobility to the guillotine or after hanged. It is rare to find those stupid ones, and I can’t wait to show you the unique idiots that are different from others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They occasionally appear in news and newspapers, don’t wear brand-name clothes, glasses are worn out, watches are bought at a charity booth, and the wife will weave and do By hand, children go to fast-food restaurants to work during the holidays – but they donate a lot to the charity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vast majority of people are calm, they may think in their hearts, see, this is the rich, but he has not been good yet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this really the case? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, the "Hunting Witch" activity was at its peak, and almost every day there was a woman/man who had scars on his body. Black cockroaches, black cats, herbs, too thin, too light (because they can fly on the broom on the sky), the nose is too long, too sharp, and so on, the incredible charges are tied to the cross and burned alive, but there is A real witch - she*, violent, sacrifice, black magic and witchcraft, the number of girls killed under her command is 612, she recorded this in her diary a number. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
