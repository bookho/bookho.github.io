			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lafayette is a giant city belonging to the thirteenth district, and the town of Grande is only four hours away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The local church placed nearly a hundred tables on the streets of the Nine Street Church, and more than 200 volunteers of different ages stood in a narrow meal. After the stage, it acts as a service staff. Fresh cold turkey meat, beef patties, peas, salads, cheese and mashed potatoes with chicken sauce, soft pumpkin cake, and creamy food can be swallowed. The small cake was crowded with a countertop covered with white tablecloths. The owner of a traditional restaurant in Pitz, donated the beer keg in his store. The huge wooden barrel was said to be his heirloom, and the seven people were not able to pull their hands. Come, but today it is only possible to have soda, because the charity dinner will not provide drunken drinks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White, brown, red and black, and a little yellow-skinned skin began to gather here in the morning, many people dragged women, but both Very quiet, very orderly, very polite, people who want to dine on the table provided by the volunteers after eating will eat their own as soon as possible, lest the people behind will wait too long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A woman stood in front of Sasha with an empty plate, and her body exuded a strange smell that was often smelled only in the deep layers of the soil. The dress is neat and tidy, very thin, and the skin on her outstretched hands and arms hangs loosely on the bone like faded and wrinkled silk, but there are no pinholes and bruises on the skin, black eyes are bright and clean, unlike It is a drug addict. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha has given her a loaf of bread and cheese. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you," she said. "You are such a beautiful boy. May God bless you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Bessib stood next to Sasha, who was responsible for the turkey meat. When it was the turn of the woman, he gave her a fat and rich breast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are also a good boy," said the woman. "It's strong and beautiful, so people like it at a glance."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She gave the position to the next person when she finished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I always think she seems to know each other." Besib thought. Then he continued to be busy with his own spoon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later, the number exceeded the previous estimate, and more food was delivered. They received about 7,000 people in four hours as energetic young people. Besib and Sasha had to undertake more work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day suddenly became dark, the people who received the food became scarce, the wind picked up the tablecloth, passed through the building, and made a strange noise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s going to rain." Standing on the other side of Sasha, Beppe, who is responsible for distributing the salad, said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Besib gently hit the tip of the elbow of Sasha, and Sasha looked obediently, behind them were mashed potatoes, pumpkin pie and small cake. The table of drinks, when he paused for less than a second, he understood what Besib had made him look at. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fat little squirrel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brown eyes. The skin is fair, fluffy, light chestnut-colored curls with a milky yellow glass hairpin, the ear is like a small shell of meat, and sweet is like a little cake she is eating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few of the volunteers. They are first-year students in Lafayette. Because of their age, they are basically only responsible for distributing cakes, and each person only needs to do a few minutes. It is better to say that it is to feel the atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than Beb, a person noticed her, and Mrs. Wilson, who was responsible for distributing mashed potatoes and pumpkin pie next door, was caught before she shifted her sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She licked her lips and looked indifferent. The child's eyes are bright and clear. When you look at you, you can find the whole world of mini in it,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until Mrs. Wilson picks up a pumpkin pie and puts it in her mouth, she will return to her heart with peace of mind. Go and continue doing your own thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone--The expressions on the faces of the given and given people are relaxed. Although it is starting to rain now, they are acting like the sun is coming from Drilled out behind the clouds, they squinted and smiled at each other with drinks, cold chicken, pies, and mashed potatoes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rain is getting bigger and the sky is dark. The surrounding buildings lit up, the transparent rain shimmered in the lampposts, and the red and gray tiles gradually darkened. The last meal of the wanderers took away two boxes of food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the food became a dinner for the volunteers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold chicken is a bit greasy and the pumpkin pie is a bit hard. The cheese was broken and there were no bubbles in the drink, but both Besib and Sasha felt it was a pretty good meal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approximately fifty pounds of turkey, chicken skin is bright, belly is heaven, It was stuffed with carrots, onions, celery, cinnamon leaves, thyme, chestnuts, chicken liver and chicken chop, and bread. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fried squid pieces, stewed squid, beef and chicken pie, suckling pig, shellfish and lobster; pumpkin pie, boiled beans, olives, Corn, bunches of grapes, apples, sweet hawthorn, raspberry jam and raspberry jam, creamy sandwich donuts, and even seal meat and venison that modern people rarely put on the table – because of the new There is a table for immigrants, and it must be on the table at Chekelle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Respect the tradition, than the sangdi, in fact, the people of Poseidon Island have always been lack of interest in Thanksgiving - Thanksgiving is a existence no more than one The “new” festival of the century, and has nothing to do with the sects – most of the people of Poseidon have noticed this festival because their many “goods” (such as, and poisonous goods, etc.) are often in this period of time. Suddenly caught in an inexplicable sales tide or *. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And than Sangdi just think that eating more points is better than eating less. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a plate of honey ham in front of him, the ham is very thin, rolled into the shape of a rose, brushed with warm butter and thick After the thick honey is baked, the honey has been slightly caramelized, showing a bright brown color, with a small cluster of mint and celery next to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cigalle sighed. "This is not done by Old Andrea."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I did it." Big Hopkins said on the right side of the table: "I hope you like it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A lot of people have been to you The craftsmanship is full of praise," Chegal said. Anthony Hopkins used to be a friend of many people (maybe still), he is knowledgeable, knowledgeable, eloquent, elegant, generous and generous - perhaps worse than this generosity, he is I like the “unique” food that I like, but I never mind sharing it with others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You don’t have to worry about raw materials,” said the “Ghoul” behind the suckling pig. “I haven’t been able to find the right material for a while.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cut Galle is not worried about what the raw material is. He only worried about where the raw materials came from. He didn't want to open the freezer door when he wanted to eat ice cream one day, but he saw the head or liver that belonged to a subordinate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He ate the rose ham, the honey was sweet and crisp, and the ham was juicy and juicy. The combination of the two is really delicious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Christmas I will let the children go out for a trip." Bisang said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Andriana stood up, cut the suckling pig, cut a loin into the Hopkins plate, and the other placed in Cheka Le before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are face to face now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark olive eyes look at the light gray eyes for about five seconds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On behalf of the Sangdi family," he continued: "Go to meet some people, see some situations, and confirm some things."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Celegal deliberately tore off a pig's leg and patiently roll it on the plate to make sure that every inch of it can be covered with raspberry jam, "they No comments will be made. No conclusions will be made. No recordings, videos, no signatures, they will not appear in warehouses, basements, docks and abandoned factories. No, no poisons, every activity involved, Every banknote that I spend is guaranteed to be legally innocent.” He lifted the pig's leg. “My dear friend, you can rest assured.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is," Big Hopkins said: "Only they are."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There will be other people." Chegal said: "They Will be protected, hey. It’s all reliable people,” he said, stuffing the tender pork leg into his mouth: “I’m sorry, but Dear. That is family affairs, so although you are my good friend. Everyone knows, but you can't participate in family affairs, can't." He said bluntly: "But Sasha is different, Hopkin He is the brother of Besib and the brother who grew up together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition, although I said it a few years ago, Hopkins, I have to say it now, you can't always look at him like a Jewish watch, if he is a girl, That's right, but he is a boy. It didn't take long to be a man. You have to let him walk, hey, suffer some hurt, eat bitter, see the blood. He is a good boy, you can't make him A chicken scorpion, this is very bad, not good for him, not good for you, not good for anyone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No one can Always looking at him, no one, except God and death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The charity show in the mall is a little later than the end of the dinner party, so the grand children of Grande eventually gather here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are crowds in the mall, the show held in the empty atrium is very successful, both men and women can not help but fascinated - although their focus Not consistent. Men’s eyes only stay on the *, buttocks and thighs that were previously only seen on TV and pictorials, while women care only about style, color and price, and fantasize that they can wear it after wearing this set. The show is beautiful and even blue is better than blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha and Besib got a little free time from the teacher in charge of them, and finally able to leave the noisy atrium and let the two hearing-minded abilities They were relieved, they couldn’t leave the ground floor, so they sat side by side on the bench for the rest of the guests, waiting for the show to end. In order to pass the time, they went to buy two cups of hot chocolate and fried chicken with milk. Piece. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They accidentally met an acquaintance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little girl who looks very similar to the squirrel, she is wearing the suit that she wore in the afternoon, only added a coat outside, her face and hair were rained The drenched. She walked alone and not far away, pulling all the decorations she could touch on the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After seeing Sasha and Besib, she walked straight to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two minutes later, she got a cup of hot chocolate and a creamy donut. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib walked away for a while, and brought back a large, warm and soft bath towel that wrapped up the two little girls, and a black The plush hooded coat, when seeing the thoughtful smile of his brother, the heirs of Poseidon Island shrugged a little uncomfortably: "It's a bit unbearable, I mean, wet. What... what?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, I think so too." Sasha blinked naughtyly. "She is really too wet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two big boys wiping hair to girls And the face, take her half-wet coat and put on a coat. They are a bit clumsy when they do this. Anyway, neither Big Hopkins nor Sandy’s tutorial will cover this. Classes; on Poseidon Island, boys who are almost the same age as Besib and Sasha, even if they are younger, will not be too small to look after themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little girl is unusually docile - put down the cup, raise his head, lower his head, don't move, stretch his arms, raise his arms, lower his arms, lower his head, Ok, sit down, you can continue to drink your chocolate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha came down, he looked at her eyes, it was beautiful eyes, but if the observation time is long enough - bright and clear, but lifeless That is not the eyes of normal children. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Warming." Besib said, after drying his hair and face, changing clothes, drinking overheated chocolate and eating doughnuts, lost The little squirrel fell asleep on the legs of Besib, and her feet rested on Sasha’s knees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you understand what this is all about?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Her mother makes She is waiting here because the babysitter has gone home for Thanksgiving, so she can't stay alone at home."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So I can let her stay alone Here?" The tens of thousands of people per hour - the rich western continent is different from the sea god island. If a child is abducted and looted, more than 90% of the criminals will not be paid for the money. She may not live for the first three hours. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe she will be back soon." Sasha said without hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have been waiting for fifty minutes before they arrived. It was a pretty woman. The light brown hair was in a helmet shape and the face was full. Patience and exhaustion, full of things in her hand, when she saw her daughter sleeping on two strange young people, she did not react, just frowning her eyebrows, woke the child violently, and ordered her to follow herself. Behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
