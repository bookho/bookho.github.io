The group of estrus male dogs, they will smash her, divide it, eat it all, and I don’t want to let the twinkling big eyes see too much, then In the bureau and the court, I said it at 1510."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In any case, she is worth a lot of money."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no five-star hotel here," the man who spoke has a rude name. In the local language, it means "a man who can't be ml because he drinks too much". When I was five years old, I used this to be a joke before I bite my first ear. Now even the old man who has been a thug for twelve years does not dare to call this name. He calls him "Nvwa" or " My grandson’s father, "Let her stay there, the scenery may not be so pleasing, but it is also a good warning, lest the little wife think too much. The Carson family What do you say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They will draw 300 million yuan first, and another 500 million yuan tomorrow morning, and another 200 million yuan before midnight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the money doesn't arrive on time, or if they want to get some tricks, we'll add a free girl - let the men go to the dry card." After taking the video, send it to the Carson home. If they are not obedient, then take the dog or dig one eye."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richards’s old man hesitated for a while. He chewed a coca pill repeatedly. The bitter taste of Coca leaves made him put his eyebrows tightly. “To tell the truth, son-in-law, I don’t know how to do this. Okay... I mean, not only 'Tang', but other people have heard the news, they want to cooperate with the Carson family, that is a good opportunity..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "But what good is that for us?" His son-in-law interrupted him rudely: "Do they have such losses? No, no, they are not." I thought about it. What does it mean to let these guys live and return in good faith? Our production sites and factories are so red. The nakedness is exposed in broad daylight - we can't keep this treasure, wait for this. We have to blow up the factory, burn the coca bush, and dismiss the workers. Do you think that the family is willing to let their islands let us rebuild the factory and raise the coca? No, all are gone, we can produce a value every year. The high purification of 10 million yuan, they have long been red. Now, let's just let the old man's mouth move and let us give up the meat on the lips. Never possible! This is not a profit, it is compensation, it is what we deserve! ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that in the end it was just roaring. The old man took off the straw hat and put it in his hand. He feared his son-in-law and also held awe of "Tang", but the family had long since refused to be the master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl is very angry. The blood vessels covered his neck and his shiny forehead. He couldn't admit that his heart and his old man were uneasy and dejected, but greed and the grievances accumulated after the failure of Meyare Bissand made him not May bow down: "'Tang' will not really do anything," he said to the old man. I also said to myself: "They are outsiders, we are Poseidon Island people, and 'Tang' if they help them. That is to eat outside, he will lose trust and support, he will never do this..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bright white light flashed through his eyes, followed by a loud noise that shattered the eardrum, followed by a hot air wave like a big tide Come. He flew all the things around him - people, coca trees, buildings, all kinds of pieces like hail.噼 啪 蒙 蒙 蒙 蒙 蒙 蒙 蒙 蒙 蒙 蒙 蒙 蒙 蒙 蒙 蒙 蒙 蒙 蒙 蒙 蒙 蒙 蒙 蒙 蒙 蒙 蒙 蒙 蒙 蒙 蒙 蒙 蒙 蒙 蒙 蒙 蒙 蒙 蒙 蒙 蒙 蒙 蒙 蒙 蒙 蒙 蒙 蒙 蒙 蒙 蒙 蒙 蒙 蒙 蒙 蒙A guard standing by the door held the gun and was rolled up on the railing on the second floor. He hung like this, soft like a heart macaroni... More things burned in the blink of an eye, blood flowing through him Eyes, he sees everything red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tried to stand up and pull out the gun - a burnt iron rod pierced his back, he looked down at his chest and rolled The bullet that hit the body caused a blood hole with a bowl size when he left. He struggled to turn around and see who killed himself, but failed. He fell down and his arms stretched forward. The fingers are distorted and seem to want to catch something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hall that is used as a catharsis place is a mess, and the people of Poseidon Island are certainly less experienced than the special personnel who specialize in rescue work, but they are more interested in knowing each other. There is no shortage of eyeliner - not everyone is willing to go with the Richards family to the cemetery - the bomb accurately destroys the guards and defenses around the hall, knocking off a whole wall, than the mulberry and other The family rushed in, and anyone who dared to hold a weapon at this time or never lie on the ground would be killed directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Found Chiz Carson." Besib said, "And John Carson."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyes were a bit weird, only Sasha followed him, but when Besib walked into the room where John Carson was held, he stayed outside the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John Carson is not dead. The surgeon on Poseidon Island is the best. He is a little pale because he has lost a lot of blood, but he doesn't expect to run or dive in the future. When Biebu walks in, he smells rich. The bitterness of the Richards family was used by him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishb bowed down, only the room, the dead and John Carson in the room, John Carson showed typical symptoms after smoking, his pupil enlarged There is no light, it looks like two round ink dots, he whispers and his face is red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. John Carson," said the teenager: "Some people don't want you to live back to the West."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;He buckled the trigger when he finished, it was a large-calibre gun, John Carson’s skull was smashed, and the smoke was exhausted. Carson actually laughed two times – Besib I don't know if it is a magical effect caused by residual smoke. The recoil makes him take a half step back when shooting. There is still a lot of blood sprayed on the face of Besib. He takes a step forward and carefully examines the bed. The person, Carson's head is like a broken tomato, the chin is miraculously complete, just not clean enough, Richards's family is not so good to shame him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib walked out of the room, Sasha glanced at him and walked to a pipe that had been blown away by the bullets and squirted water. Handkerchief, hand it over to Besib. He took it and rubbed his face. The mixture of blood and water ran down the chin and infiltrated into the clothes. Besib felt much better. "Thank you, brother," he said. "I will never laugh at your sissy again because of this." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A young and familiar young man came over - after about two or three seconds, Sasha recognized that he was one of Chegal’s new hitters. Letter, he whispered a few words with Besib, and Besib paused. Turning to Sasha: "How about coming? Chiz Carson is a little problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Small problem?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...oh, maybe not too small," the two of them followed the young man. Crossing countless gravel rubble, some of them are sharp and sharp, like a dagger. "Richards's son-in-law bakes a woman, as if she is a girl's tutor. In front of the girl, she For this crying and crying, hysterical, they gave her a mixture of the mixture (for anesthesia and calming) in order to make her quiet, three times a day - the attack awakened her, she was holding a guy not paying attention Grab his gun... No one can get close to her, she has injured a man."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are they giving her?" Sasha calmed, but asked Besib to feel a bit sinister and asked: "When you find that she is noisy," small doses will be fascinating. However, when used at high doses, users will have illusions of sinister delusions and false illusions. Under the drive of delusion, they will take the lead in attacking others. very dangerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bissib smiled and said: "It seems that next time I have to write clearly in the mission statement, 'Forbidden to feed the hostages!'." They could have Chiz Carson is tied up and stunned. But they didn't do that. In any case, the Richards family is a man on the island of Poseidon, and Carson is an outsider. They obey orders, but there is always some irritability in their hearts--as a new force that has been "working" for several years. They still despise Beib and ignore the people around him until they get rid of things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chiz Carson sits on a clearing, unkempt, skinny in just a few days, she holds a gun, muzzle against the stomach, thumb hook Holding the trigger, the gun is clamped between the gaps of the knees, and the people in the Sandy are using processed bullets. Only one can smash her entire abdominal cavity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little Hopkins walked towards her with a lot of gaze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QiZi moved slightly, her eyes turned up in the dirty, agglomerated hair: "Good afternoon, Sasha."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good afternoon," Sasha said, approaching two steps, Chiz did not move, and he squatted halfway in front of her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened to my dad?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...He is dead."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qizi slammed his mouth and spit in the middle of Sasha’s left face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand did not move, his hand slowly inserted into the girl's knee, the index finger caught the trigger and pulled out the pistol. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood up, the two boys immediately rushed up, forcing Chiz to wear a shirt, the shirt is a man, the sleeves are long, just in time Behind the knot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sputum is pink, flowing down from the face of Sasha, passing through the lips, smashing the sputum, a bloody smell, tasted before him. Any kind of blood should be rich. Besib clumsily folded the wet handkerchief, found a place that was not too dirty, and wiped him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened?" Besib whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She is mine...just like John Carson is yours." Sasha replied tiredly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chez Carson should return to the Western Continent a week ago and return to her mother to continue her safe, warm, sunny, spotless and happy life. It was he who let her stay, under the direction of Dr. Hopkins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib was silent for a while, "her father will die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One wipe The light smile distorted Sasha's lips, and he lowered his eyes. "This is not a good comfort. Besib, we can't tear my chest out of my heart because of someone suffering from coronary heart disease." He raised his hand. The heavy iron piece of the handle made a turn between the thin long fingers: "Reassured, I know what I am doing - and I will bear the consequences for it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big clock has been knocked ten times, has already eaten dinner, has done personal clean-up work, and has a sleepy prayer, Sasha Hope. Kingsian lay quietly on his bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The window slammed, and Shasha turned and looked, and a black shadow came in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's me, Sasha." Besib said, "Let me stay here for one night."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without waiting for Sasha to answer, he hurried into the blanket of Sasha, first lying flat, a few minutes later, he rolled over and hooked the neck of Sasha, hot The breath of the spray was sprayed on the friend's shoulder, and it was maintained for nearly half an hour. When Sasha thought he was already asleep, he suddenly muttered in a very low voice: "I don't like it at all, I don't like it... ...I don't like it, Sasha, I don't like it at all..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not finished, his hands are getting harder and harder, his body is shaking like a burst . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha waited patiently and with tolerance, Besib finally fell asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't like it either," Sasha said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
