			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ps:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two hundred and fifty-three chapters to two hundred and fifty-four chapters rewritten Go and see Ha... otherwise you can't read the birds...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Constantin. Crovin’s face is swollen and numb, like He was fanned back and forth by dozens of big slaps. He was not as smart as anyone else, and his reaction was a bit slow, but he understood the meaning of his wife. She chose him because he was the stupidest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lady did not seem to be aware of the shyness and anger of the adopted child. She reached out and turned around and turned the ring with the gold diamond in a hurry: "So, Have you confirmed with them and paid for it with diamonds?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," said Constantine: "The diamond is small and light, wanting Change to cash, or use it for mortgages."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do they want to cut polished finished products or blanks?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Complete," Konstantin said: "We have a dispute over the price of the blank, so we choose all the finished products." He also said that a large part of the value of diamonds depends on In the later stage of cutting and polishing, it is quite normal for the price of a batch of blanks to fluctuate between 100,000 yuan and one million yuan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How are you going to give them?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Constantin hesitated for a while:" We can't hand over the diamond directly - we can't disclose where it is going."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lady snorted, she was the war-torn, the war It has lasted for more than two decades, and its aftermath has not been completely eliminated until today. Some regions and countries that produce diamonds are still violent, bloody and endless fratricidal killings, and rebel forces are like driving pigs and sheep. That drove their people to dig and find diamonds, and then use these diamonds in exchange for the weapons necessary to maintain their domination, armaments, fuel, food, medicine, transportation, and hiring of the army, a large number of high quality and low price diamond blanks can almost It is said that it has rushed into the market without restraint, causing the price of diamonds to drop suddenly. The World Diamond Center's sales organization, which holds 90% of the world's diamond trades at the time, believes that this situation can no longer be sustained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They use all means to convinced people that as long as they don't buy diamonds in chaotic areas, they can contain civil strife, abuse, and organizational ideas and proposals that have been supported by many powerful people in a short period of time. People are willing to wear one or more tragic souls when wearing a beautiful diamond ring - in the end. In the five major producing areas of diamonds, sixty-one regions signed a world diamond process certification agreement with the state, which states that they produced. Diamonds above 0.5 carat must be marked with a laser to mark the origin of the code. If regional and national diamonds are proven to be used to purchase arms or to hire an army, the exchange has the right to terminate their legal sale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who is the biggest beneficiary of this agreement? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, don’t be too naive, of course not the civilians in those turbulent areas, there is only one winner who can benefit from it – just stand for sale A joint mining company behind the organization. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rulers who have closed the legal trading route will not sit still, they will only dig up more diamonds and then sell the blanks in a smuggled manner - The price is only one-tenth of the previous one. One thousandth of the profits has attracted countless diamond traders. Most of the blanks have flowed to the joint mining company - the only thing the company has done for this agreement is Closed one or two small exchanges. However, 15% of the source of diamond blanks is not mentioned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orlosa’s diamond production and reserves have risen year by year, and it has become a threat and a very disobedient threat. The World Diamond Center Sales Organization will be ecstatic to seize this little bitch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there a way to get a batch of uncoded diamonds?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't Guarantee," Konstantin said: "The quantity is too large."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the total amount of our goods?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"175 million."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lady quickly calculated in her mind that the seller would not want less than zero five Carats with diamonds larger than two carats. Diamonds less than 0.5 carat have no value at all, and diamonds larger than 2 carats are easily noticeable. Similarly, they cannot reveal the source of diamonds, and a quality between one carat and two carats The price of colored diamonds is about 10,000 yuan per carat. Constantine is right, and wants to get dozens of silently. A few hundred carats of high-quality diamonds without coding are not too difficult. In tens of thousands of carats, as long as there is a problem with a polishing worker or an inspector, various investigations and inquiries will follow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coded diamonds will be stamped directly on the network through the network, they will pay attention to the whereabouts of the diamond, if it is not clear, it will be a hassle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Talk to me." The lady said, "What are you going to say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I want this diamond to be completely disappeared," said Constantine. "We will talk like normal business, sign contracts, do inspections, diamonds will be temporarily saved in the vault. Then, on a night, the vault Being opened, the diamond was taken away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who's the vault? Ours?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Friends." This statement indicates that the vault will belong to a peripheral staff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The diamonds will become stolen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, but they There is a way to deal with it," said Constantine. "Orlosa sells tens of millions of carats of diamonds a year. And," he said: "I will also provide some inlaid diamond ornaments."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. almost immediately understood what he meant: "Is Platinum?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," Constantine said: "Platinum."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lady leaned back and sat comfortably on the rosary wrapped around her wrist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your thoughts are good," she praised. "We are doing that - the last question, who are you going to steal the diamonds?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...we?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," Madame leaned forward "Let the people of the Sangdi family go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But," Constantine stuttered: "They...will not be willing "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That would convince them," said the lady with a sly smile: "That is just a small apple. Isn't it?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
