			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How are you?" Besib said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A flesh-colored thick rope and a half-support column are wrapped around Together, it was a hand of Besib, his other hand caught Sasha, and the whole person in Sasha was hanging in the air - although he would swim, the creatures in the sea would pose a threat to him. (if there is one), but those sharp fragments and falling concrete blocks are hard to say - even if the ability of the abilities is far greater than ordinary people, Sasha does not like to be injured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lifted one foot against a boom that was tilted forty-five degrees, pushing his body to swing gently in the air, near In the auditorium, he reached out and grabbed a carved metal railing that leaned to the surface of the water and climbed up with it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We have to hurry," Besib said. "The export is about to be overwhelmed." He let Sasha walk in front, two boys half and a half. Swim, they passed through Boa, Boa. Noel Douglas was still hanging on the chair, his eyes followed them, and he was stunned, his face was gray, his lips were squatting tightly, and after a while, it shivered. It’s amazing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He strives to control himself, suppresses his desire for life, and resolutely does not ask for help from those who he once scorned and framed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishb looked at him for two seconds and Sasha waited for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." Besib said categorically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea is rising, a person has fallen, not far from Boa, he is still alive, but in poor condition, he is almost unable to wave his hands, but He was still struggling. He repeatedly put his head out of the water, his lips protruding, and blowing a string of blisters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dead, die," Boa shouted: "Don't die!" He frantically twisted his body. The power seems to have returned to his body. He swayed from side to side, leaning forward and backward. Ten fingers left a bright red scratch in the place where they touched. The fierce and cursing curse, shouting loudly, abandoning his parents and seeing death. Saved more than Sangdi and Hopkins, to ignore his teachers, and those stupid classmates. The low-servant servant, the insensitive spectator, was described as an inferior servant (the son of the scorpion... everyone was encircled into a terrible reverie by him. He closed his eyes, his voice was hoarse and did not stop until the sea was dip With his hair on, he began to cry in despair, pray and scream.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He regretted it. He doesn't want to die, he wants to live well, at least for a hundred years. He still has too many things to do, he does not want his life to end - Mr. Douglas will be sad for his heirs for hours, but in less than a year, he will have a new wife and New son. Maybe in the future, when he thinks of Boa. Noel Douglas, he will secretly be happy to take the opportunity to get rid of the boy’s greedy mother. As for his mother, the money and surname of the ex-husband who used it even after the divorce. Woman. I will only mourn that I have lost a strong bargaining chip. She will also get married and have new children. What about school teachers? They simply don't miss a student who can no longer bring benefits and glory to them. Classmates, he can't remember what they have to hide in memory. They want to come as well - no, he doesn't want to die like this. He didn't want to disappear, was put into the coffin, buried in the cemetery, let his body become a comfort zone for bugs and bacteria! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea water poured into his nose and mouth, groaning, like tears, like blood, bitter and salty, his ears filled with cockroaches Hearing, he tried to open his eyes in fear, the sea water stimulated his cornea, he swayed his head madly... Help! Help! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hand grabbed his hair and raised it to the surface. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cockroaches that Boer suffered were suddenly untied. He was taken up and dragged to the middle of the second floor seat. He opened his mouth and tried to breathe in the air. Then he cried, and he hugged the man who saved him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Stand up, follow me." The man said, "Or stay here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Okay," said Boa. "Okay." His throat was similar to the sound of asthma, the sequela of drowning - he fumbled to grab the seat and wanted to stand up on a sloping plane. It’s not easy to walk, especially if he used his own ability before. He couldn’t do it. Here is the metal floor, the sea water, the plants can’t get it from here, and when they grow fast, they absorb His power, but he couldn't help watching his parents die. Of course, he couldn't have expected that Mr. Douglas and his wife could watch him die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea has not passed the hole, Boa’s eyes are still crying, but he can already see something, and a woman walking in front of him. She was soaked with a cruel asshole, she was soaked, her shirt was close to the skin, her hands were slender, her palms were wide, and he clearly remembered the blessings that he had given him - so powerful and generous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have to swim," said his savior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No problem," Boa said, he has recovered a little bit calmly: "I am a swimming club."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah," she said, "I know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is a young, glamorous woman, her eyes are also The blue one is deeper than the Douglas family, like the ocean under the sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can I know your name?" Boa asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman is taking a deep breath, and for his problems, she just waved her hand indifferently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a memorable concert," Abel said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory stared at him: "You ruin everything!" He had to amplify the sound, and the helicopter was too noisy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is Xiqiao," Abel said. "And Samuel."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know anything about the contradictions between you and I am not interested at all." Gregory said angrily. "I only know that you ruined my concert."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This can't blame us all," Abel said. "You never mentioned that Xiqiao has the ability to release infrasound."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "I am a normal ordinary person," Gregory said. "I am sorry, I really can't see any change in Xiqiao. I only know that she can really seduce many people, but this kind of... Infrasound, God bless! She did not suddenly become a bat!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abel thought for a moment: "Dear Mr. Corso," he said earnestly "The bat emits ultrasonic waves of more than 20,000 Hz, and the ability of the scorpion is to emit infrasound waves below 20 Hz. They have a gap of nearly a thousand times directly."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory made a dull curse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
