			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18:29. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he was moved to the hospital’s stretcher, Martin cursed, he was both depressed and disappointed because there was a big chance (too big to be sure), he The guy who tried to catch it, the living corpse - maybe he was also a criminal, or simply a ghoul's ally, but more likely it was just an unfortunate shield, an innocent bait... anyway He will not be Anthony Hopkins. The real demon, probably already broke into an unknown dark corner, waiting for an appropriate time, killing a person, so that his little nephew can be pulled out of the trap - they will catch him Martin thought, his eyes hurt very much, his ears were too, the liquid quickly wet his cheeks and neck, his nose was sorely sour, he had no chance, no matter who caught the vicious guy, It won't be Martin Puzo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The sloppy bitch of the sluts! Fucking his mother's stock!" Throughout the inspection, he has been cursing incoherently, I don't know Is it to himself, or to someone next to him, this boring way of venting makes the caregivers and doctors around him feel bored together, and the doctor who determined that he has no major problems is being bandaged for Martin Puzo. The male nurse made a concealed gesture. The latter grinned. The alcohol cotton caught in the scorpion fell straight on the young man's cheek. The alcohol squeezed out of the cotton and flowed into the not-clean mouth. Martin’s anger reached the extreme, but the caregiver’s movements were too fast. Before he greeted the maternal relatives of any of the people present, a roll of white, soft, non-adhesive bandages was slammed on Martin’s chin, then Quickly circling along his thin, awl-like chin, and quickly wrapped up this incompetent idiot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The caregiver smiled at the poor little mummy, showing a bit of yellowish teeth, but the next moment he gave a scream, he rushed from the side of the stretcher Retreating, raising his hands and looking carefully, and then cast his suspicion on the metal frame of the stretcher, and knowing that Martin’s ability to cast a condemnation on the stretcher’s wounded, Martin’s more fierce look, It’s not a condition, he will let them see their teeth. He moved his fingers. Just did have a weak current passing through his body, but it was not controlled by him. Reflection or instinctual spontaneous counterattack? Martin's lips behind the bandages entangled with the eyebrows. The current in his body was a bit unstable. He grabbed the frame of the stretcher. Maybe he should slowly and partially release them? Although this will leave him with no protection and attack power for a while – but in the current situation... even if he can store a nuclear power station in his body, his body does not allow him to Continue to use this dangerous force for a short time, some of his skin even appeared metallized, metallization is a relatively small type of electric shock, but its appearance is a warning: his body is already overwhelmed ... If he continues to be willful, perhaps there will be electric burns, electrocautery, respiratory failure, coma and even permanent damage to the organs. Money and hatred are important, but Martin Puzo has only one life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he must be able to control them, or the organization will come to help him "control", just as they control Catherine, Martin closes his eyes, compared to The former, a little bit of patience today is nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How do you feel now?" The doctor said, Martin felt that he was approaching and hugged his arm. He was injecting for Martin. "What?" Martin asked. The doctor did not answer his question at first, until he began to gently move the syringe, "a little lidocaine." He said, observed Martin's heartbeat and breathing: "100mg plus intravenous drip in glucose water." He moved his hands and walked over: "What happened just now?" He said: "I have to pay attention to it later, change the vulnerability of the guy, the static electricity can suddenly smash his life!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going to your mother's static electricity, Martin shouted in his heart, he didn't want to do that, but a sudden sense of crisis caught him, like a raptor catching a bird from the air, he had to take the whole body. Power is used against it; and he immediately finds that everything he has done is in vain, that power is too great, it swallows him almost at once, and it grips him tightly, just like he is Not long ago, when he caught the child, he was slammed into the sky, and then stepped into the mud, and then a tornado... This evil wind not only rolled up his body, but also rolled up his power, he completely I can't control them, not just the rest of the body, but the current drawn from other places screams from his fingertips, hair, lips and even toenails, just like from hell. The snakes that jumped out of the glacier turned everyone around Martin into a ghost at the end of the century. They screamed and trembled. The arc photoelectric flower danced on the skin and muscles, igniting clothing and hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin stood up from the stretcher, the current burning his fingers, eyes, and ears, the blackened bandages were driven by the current, he knew he was in adulthood In the pain of enduring, whether it is spiritual or physical. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But same, he has never been so happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18:30. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abel suddenly stopped, which made a guy who was behind him almost slammed into his ass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unlucky one in the length of the body was shouting dissatisfied, but he immediately found out that the big man in front seemed to be out of the situation: "Hey, What happened to you?" For a second or two, he looked at the light gray shirt behind his opponent and quickly turned black. The hot tide came on his face. He was not surprised to find this annoying big man. Even in such a short period of time, let his sweat soak the entire shirt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From...open..." Leave here! leave me alone! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abel turned around, his feelings became more acute than ever, he was able to see himself from the eyes of others, his face was distorted, his face was stunned The sweat is flowing from his hair as if it had been hit by heavy rain. He wants to warn, yell, let others stay away from him, but his tongue is groaning, he wants to escape quickly, but finds his own double The legs are not listening to the command of the brain! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What kind of feeling is this? ! He has never met, let alone try it - it is tearing his skin layer by layer, stripping his ingenuity, revealing the monster hidden inside Abel Clayton in broad daylight. Under the eyes of the public. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you need a doctor?" asked the little man. He reached out and tried to grab Abel's arm. He remembered it, this big man. It should be the action group. It is said to be stuffed with Superman and Transformers, but it doesn't seem to be necessary now. At least the man in front of him looks weak and can even be said to be terrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abel stared at him, opened his mouth, human vitality is so fresh, bright, powerful... even if he closes his eyes and blocks his ears Can also feel the same feelings... capture, no, no, no! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little man opened his mouth, and when he couldn’t touch the shirt at the tip of his finger, the big man suddenly jumped up, yes, As literally, he jumped up and jumped from the front to the back. Before he turned around, the guy ran away without a trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
