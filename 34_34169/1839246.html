			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The helicopter landed on the top floor of Paradise Palace, and when Besib jumped down, he accidentally discovered that the ground was spotless, and he glanced at the building. But hundreds of feet, like a wall of rolling dust, played a tongue in my heart. Sasha Hopkins followed his father, Hopkins seemed to have recovered, his movements were bright, his eyes were bright, and two people in three-piece suits were waiting for them outside the helicopter landing ring. Besib was the first to see these two people, and Shasha should be, but they behave like friends who have been with these two boys for ten years - but they have not been so enthusiastic about the tiredness of the young people. Or because they are too meticulous to cause a vigilance that should not be there - Besib estimates that they should be the deputies of the casino owner, such people have a beautiful face, eloquence, smart and well-behaved They are good at welcoming and unscrupulous. Under the guidance of the owner of the casino, they can give a good life to a king or a god. Free VIP cabin or private jet, yacht transfer, free presidential suite, free Food and wine, free topless performances, free glamorous girls, one two, three four, just a few... Of course, the premise is that you have this value, for example You have power, or a part of a powerful person who can't give up, son, daughter, nephew or something, or just have money. They cast their expenses on you and they can always get it back from you, even if you only want to use black chips of 5 yuan at the beginning... In the end you will find yourself throwing a stack of milky white gold edges unconsciously. Chips, that kind of chip is one of Wu Yiyuan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For some worthy customers, they will also send greeting cards and a small gift to each major holiday and your birthday every year. The gifts are all collected by the deputies from all over the world, the vases woven into pearls, the scorpions of golden monkey skins. The gilded sterling silver ship model, the heather tube of the Mediterranean region, and so on, and so on, the only thing is that they are filled with one or two red chips, which are worth one hundred yuan - you Will you put Las Vegas in one of your vacation spots while holding them? Even if you know that it may be more expensive than anywhere else? No, you rejected the temptation, you decided not to go anywhere, but you can't throw those chips. This is money, and in the hearts of superstitious people, this is money that can bring good luck. So you put it in your pocket. On a morning, you successfully signed a contract that earned tens of thousands of dollars. You woke up in a foreign hotel center, and you found yourself a distance from Las Vegas. Gass is just an hour or two. How many people will involuntarily sprout the idea of ​​“trying to try their luck”? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, there is no shortage of casinos in the huge kingdom of Chekal Bissand. Its profit can reach one-fifth of the total income, second only to drugs, but he regrets that these casinos are always difficult to scale. Climate - he also thought about inserting a hand in Las Vegas, he had a chance. When this place was still a barren land, it was still more than a hundred years ago, no one has the vision to be sure that it will become a cornucopia. When the Sangdi saw it, it was completely occupied by local gangs. They opened casinos, hotels, luxury shopping malls, and supporting luxury houses and hospitals. Golf courses and water playgrounds, but the entertainment facilities here can only be gambling. The owner of the casino never wants his guests’ attention to be taken away by anything else – no, it’s illegal to be here, but those who don’t have tops, sing, magic and water ballet, and Sitting at the blackjack table as a "fake gambler", wearing a very exposed young woman, gamblers can take them to the room at will, they do not collect money, but this is equipped with a bed, carpet, The room for new wine, wine, snacks, condoms and showers costs $200 per room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some fathers will bring them here when their children (mostly sons) are nearing adulthood, teach them how to gamble, and play with women, just like teaching them to drink Like smoking, they believe that it is much better to contact them under the supervision of their father than they are trying to come privately with curiosity and impulsiveness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the arrival of Hopkins did not attract too much attention, the three of them were arranged in a noble family suite, there are two in the suite The rooms are fully equipped and luxuriously furnished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All things are brand new," the deputy who led them into the door said with respect: "Please feel at ease."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please kindly thank me to Mr. Shane Battier." Anthony Hopkins said politely: "By the way, tell me, I will visit him before dinner, and my son. ...and his friend, Besib. Bisangdi."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deputy crystal green eyes stayed on the chocolate-colored boy for a short while "Yes, sir." He fainted. "Please take a rest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishb didn’t seem to hear Hopkins’s words, he With his thumb on his back, walking up and down the carpet, the carpet in the middle of the living room is a bold golden ochre, bright like a desert under the sun. He walks up and down, curiously looking at his feet. Submerged by long fluff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha leaned against the railing of the balcony. Below the balcony is a sparkling pool. If he wants, he can jump directly into the pool from the balcony. It is now at noon, and some of the overnight gambling guests just got up and there are very few people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two pretty pretending puppies, this trick can't play a role in front of Anthony Hopkins, but he didn't hide their meaning . Sasha Hopkins, he never concealed, and Besib, he is the son of Chegal, Bisangdi, and a friend of Sasha Hopkins, both of which are doomed to him. I can know some things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The first time I came to Las Vegas was twenty-five years ago," Anthony Hopkins gestured, and Sasha immediately ran. Go to the bar and pour a cup of iced soda with lemon juice. "You also come," Big Hopkins said. "You need to open your appetite. After half an hour is lunch time. The frozen crab of Paradise Palace." Legs and Chinese dim sum are worthy of tasting, I promise you will like it - I fell in love with them for the first time - the gamblers twenty-five years ago did not have this taste. That night, I was in sandwiches and beer Accompanied by him, he won 75,000 yuan at Black Jack (21:00)," Besib and Sasha quickly calculated in their minds to compare the currency rate of twenty-five years ago and now. There is no doubt that it is a lot of money: "Not in the Palace of Heaven, when the Palace of Heaven did not exist, and Sean Battier was my dealer. Later he told me that he was caught by the owner of the casino that night. In the past, he stole a skunk. He was ordered to leave me, leaving behind 75,000 yuan. Otherwise, he will get along with the cactus in the desert. At that time, the gangs did it, maybe they are doing it now, it is very convenient. There are loose sand everywhere, no matter what you did last night, After a few hours, the sand will cover up all the traces.” Hopkins smiled and revealed the rows of tiny white teeth: “When I was at dinner, he took me to taste roast beef and scrambled eggs. After the meal, we saw Performance, there were only Kangkang dances and some unsettled things. I remember a girl with six bears, she gave them candy, ordered them to turn around her, and one of them. Kissing; at one o'clock in the morning, he knocked on my door, sent me the girl who kissed the bear, and champagne. The next day he specially sent a hearty breakfast. He suggested that I continue, because I saw him. The best and smartest player, I think he is right," Hopkins smiled and his little wrinkles in his eyes gathered together: "I continued to gamble for three days, I have lost. Win, but in the end, my chips can be I exchanged 300,000 yuan. I said goodbye to him. Poor Sean, he was so scared that he stuttered and told me that if I really took the money from these chips and walked out of Las Vegas today, then Tomorrow we will become a member of the unknown body outside the city - the rules at that time are not as strict as they are now, I have to die, as a derelict bookmaker, he also has to die."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
