The general supervisor of the stage shouted, and several engineers immediately ran to check the equipment, and the on-site phonographer stared at the screen: Wait," he said. "Look at the mouth shape of Xiqiao."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xi's mouth is wrong, she is actually singing, but that song is absolutely Not the first one in the concert catalogue, the general supervisor of the stage thought for a while, "Let's see the reaction of the audience." The operator immediately met his request, and the lights on the auditorium opened unobtrusive. A small part of the camera lens of the auditorium began to make a flat 360-degree rotation, and a piece of confused face shook on the display. "It's not like they should react." The general supervisor said: "Look at the VIP seats." The camera tilted down and just put the Douglas family in the box. Mr. Douglas was close to the seat, his fingers were impatient and beat the broad knees, and the woman beside him. Appreciate your fingernails one by one, and the children among them are bored. Playing with a trumpet-shaped white flowers - how unlike you are listening look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The VIP seats are only thirty feet from the stage, and the river and the anti-sound board can give the sound of the West to their ears very well, unlike the two The audience in the third-class seats can only rely on the spread of the speakers, they should be able to directly hear the voice of Xiqiao, unless Xiqiao has not heard from the beginning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The engineers have checked all the equipment roughly, no problem, the computer has no alarm, the stage supervisor is preparing to inform the chorus players to come again for a short time, one is to The detection equipment has any real faults, and the second is to save the field. They can't let the audience continue to wait for the stupidity. Then they find that Xiqiao is playing them as monkeys. The general supervisor said in his heart, but fortunately this is the last. once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A stage supervisor quickly conveyed the opinions of the general supervisor, and after a minute he returned. Looks like a rush: "There is a problem." He hurriedly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general supervisor licked his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miranda suddenly fainted," the young supervisor said. "Tom vomits, only Millie can talk, but singing is impossible. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s really a fucking ghost!" The general supervisor roared and cursed, he knew that he shouldn’t panic at this time, at the very least It can't be, but his body is like a little demon who has jumped up and down. The blood is boiling and the temples are rising. He can't stop the impulse to take anything to the other's head. "What happened to the damn device!" He stood up. The chair was knocked over and a staff member was caught by his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not my fault!" The man shouted with a louder voice, and the head of the general supervisor became more and more painful. Waving his arm and giving the guy a punch. The beaten person counterattacked without hesitation, and he punched his fist in the eyes of the general supervisor. The other supervisors immediately rushed up. They seemed to have completely forgotten what they should do and participated in the barking and beating. All the staff around and passing through were rolled in, the wires were broken, the precision machinery fell to the ground, the sparks jumped, a box of cola was knocked over the ground, and the glass bottles were broken. The brown liquid ran a bubble and flowed in all directions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until a crisp, short, and huge sound rang in the room, it was so unstoppable that everyone’s brain seemed to be split by this sound. They refused to continue to swear each other, but they held their heads after a scream. The supervisor supervised the hoe and climbed up against the back of the person. He barely opened one eye. One can't open it anymore). He reached over and grabbed it, and he saw a man standing next to the monitor. Holding a headset in his hand, the cord on the headset was pulled out and connected to an internal speaker. He turned the control knob on the speaker and screwed it to the maximum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing?" The general supervisor yelled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wake up?" The man took a step forward, and the general supervisor blinked his eyes in confusion, recognizing that this man is the latest in Xiqiao. Psychologist: "What are you doing?" The general supervisor repeated, but the tone was softer. The voice is still going on, and every sound is like inside the body of the General Supervisor: "I said... this..." He had to choose to speak when the sound was interrupted: "What is it?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The plucked piano." Anthony Hopkins looked up and looked up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is really what I have heard...the most terrible...the sound of the piano." The chorus said that he staggered and stood up, thin The body was full of cola and glass slag. He lifted his arm and looked at it. He pulled out a few large slags and he seemed to feel no pain at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe," Hopkins said: "But it can save your life." He turned to the general supervisor: "I don't think this can last for a long time." , General Supervisor, now we have to stop Xiqiao." His voice is not high, but surprisingly clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What does this have to do with Xiqiao..." The general supervisor looked at the screen and his eyes widened. From the VIP table, the audience was at In the chaos, some people are vomiting, some people show their pain in the chest or head, others are emulating them, beating each other and yelling at them, the most frightening, and several people fall in their seats. ,like a statue,. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Infrasound," Hopkins said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general supervisor looked at him, "speaker?" Many people know what inferior sound waves are. Sound waves with a frequency less than 20hz (hertz) are called infrasound waves. It is not easily attenuated and is not easily absorbed by water and air. The wavelength is often very long, so it can be diffracted around some large obstacles - blowers, mixers, loudspeakers, tall buildings and bridges that sway in hurricanes, ship sailing, car racing, artillery launch, missile flight, nuclear explosion , sea storms, volcanic eruptions, large meteorite landings, tsunami, lightning and thunder, wave landing, underwater vortex, air turbulence, tornado, magnetic storm, aurora, etc. can produce infrasound waves, the audio equipment used in the concert is high power It is not impossible to have so few subsonic waves. If the infrasound wave is just close to the natural frequency of the alpha rhythm or viscera of the human brain, it will indeed cause confusion similar to the previous one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seven-Hz infrasound wave can penetrate more than ten meters of reinforced concrete. The only way to deal with it is to create a vacuum and create a sound wave that just happens to be able to fight it. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but neither of them can be made by humans. The general supervisor thinks that the doctor’s brain is also a problem, the reason why the psychiatrist and their patients I can talk about it together because they are all crazy. The general supervisor always thinks that he is holding his head, first unplugging the headphone cord connected to the speaker, and then rushing to the console, he is ready to turn off all Speaker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let the West go down first!" Chief Superintendent said, Gregory Kosom clearly said that this concert is a must, It is impossible to continue now, he can only guarantee that there will be another time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No," a mechanical engineer replied. He was sweating, his mouth was twitching, and his ears were bitten off: "The settlement is out of order!" It seems to be stuck, we have to go to the stage to pick her up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For God's sake, just do it!" the general supervisor shouted. "And, Mr. Corso? My headphones are broken, who can contact him!?" He bent down and kneaded his ears, the voice came again, but he vowed to turn off the speaker: " I beg you, no matter who you are, to turn off the speaker!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only one or two staff members can insist on acting according to his orders, and other people are There was the same reaction as the audience, vomiting, weakness, coma, and a few people's mouths filled with pink foam. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
