			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishb yawned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he is not necessary in the future, he will never give his body to others anymore - even Sasha will not do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole morning, he has slept for nearly ten hours, his mind is already awake, his muscles and bones are still immersed in a similar paralysis The feeling of exhaustion - Besib found it difficult to control them, especially when he wanted to tear a piece of bacon - he suspected that his teeth were still in his mouth, and the glass filled with milk was heavy. He almost took off his hand, then he wisely chose a side of the coffee, the coffee cup is small and much lighter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was the first to taste this taste, which is really not very good, and he sincerely hopes that this is also the last time. Maybe he can get some compensation from Sasha, for example, homework? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to say that the luck of Besib and Sasha is very good, and their social work has already been bid farewell to Xiqiao (definitely, farewell) The concert is over. The concert ended up as a human tragedy - when the rescuers were not present, Sasha and Besib brought more than one from the cold, dark water with their own vision, hearing and power. People, old people, adults, and children, all wet and exhausted, the two big boys managed to bring them together, and managed to pick up a bunch of bonfires - Professor Nenet could not say that their actions were going to be Far better than other trips (going to the hospital to chat with patients, organizing materials for book management, or holding an auction for the Dog Association, etc.), but he promised to submit a detailed and true report to the school. In short, even with Besib, they no longer have to worry about volunteer time for the school year. But this does not mean that they can leave other homework regardless of whether the Grand Boarding School’s requirements are more stringent than that of public schools. The students are twice as many volunteers as other school students. To complete two astronomical assignments. A biological assignment, a physics experiment, and the most indispensable readings of Besib... seven readings within the specified range -, and. Oh, he almost forgot, and the ar (pre-university) preparation course - the devil testified. Just a year ago, he thought that he could have a happy two or three years at least! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I remember you said that everything has been solved." Sasha raised his eyebrows and his eyes were severe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is my solution - handed it to you. Sasha," Besib said sincerely: "Oh, I believe in you." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha stared at him, and Besib returned with a sweet smile. "Okay," Sasha said. "I will do it for you in astronomy and biology. You will do it yourself in physics experiments. As for reading homework (Bishb promptly sends a sad sigh)... I will sort out the outline and Timetables, personal relationships, and other important parts, you can read them on the plane."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"ar?" Besib asked with expectation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Cechal wants you to go to college," Sasha paused and added: "A good university."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bessib slouched the scrambled eggs in the plate, he did not try to bargain. Because he still knows a little about Sasha - many people will be confused by the appearance of Sasha Hopkins, thinking that he is a gentle and lovely little angel. On the contrary, he is a cold, lazy and stubborn demonic. In this world, there are not many people who are willing to pay their attention. Besib is one of them, but don't expect him to be like you with old Andreas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Please give me some meat, tenderer." Besib said, obviously. Whether it is sore and paralyzed muscles or preparing for further crushing his work, it has not affected the appetite of Xiaobi Sangdi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maid turned slightly on the waist: "Beef, lamb, or chicken?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not Sibu thought about it: "All come, the chicken should be skinned, the sauce should be rich, and a basket of sesame bread should be added."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waiting for a new meal At that time, the son of the thug leader looked around in a boring manner, and unexpectedly found that he could not see Catherine at the breakfast table. Sasha’s aunt, know that they have been here, dear aunt is not absent, she takes care of The strength of the sand is like facing a newborn baby or a quadriplegic, and suffering from Parkinson's disease - Besib thought of last night, it seems that she is also scatter Sha had a lot of suffering in his hand - he also wanted to go back to the room, or just stayed in the long cane chair bathed in the morning sun, but his stomach has been smashing into one. Group mention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shawn Battier is stationed in the villa, for those who have temperament and demanding services from the rich and powerful, of course, will not do Everything is slow and idiotic (like the so-called sommeliers in second-rate restaurants, whenever they open a bottle of wine, it’s like a striptease), Bessie’s meat is less than fifteen Minutes were sent up, a beef roll with a small arm, wrapped in celery, carrots, onions, eggs, cheese, sprinkled with salt and pepper; a large plate, about twenty baseball mutton balls With celery and fresh fennel roots; a whole bowl of skinned chicken is cut into small diced, fried into small rolls, and mixed with orange and olive onions to form a salad. There is a small bowl in the bread basket filled with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. This is for him to use bread - the traditional taste of the sea god island, Besib shrugged, really considerate and care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“When are we leaving Las Vegas?” Sasha asked, and Hopkins’s determined time would determine whether he would open the baggage and take out the laptops and other instruments needed to do the job. The astronomical work is an observation constellation. Each person is different and free to choose. He has to prepare in advance, Las Vegas is one kind, and other places are another. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Probably have to wait a day or two," Hopkins said: "At the latest, seventy-two hours, we can return to Grande. The town is over." He thought for a moment: "But I don't think there will be any more things that will affect us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Five million." Red hair Judas repeated, the banknotes were placed neatly in an old, well-made calfskin box. The red and red banknotes are all new, with a scent of ink, a total of 50 ties, each for 100,000 yuan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Sean Battier sat behind his desk and put his hands on his chest: "Close the box, then give it to me." The old friend sent it, he will be very happy to see this little gift."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a lot of money." And it is Sean Bar. Tyre's, not the Palace of Heaven, Anthony Hopkins is a guest of Shane Battier, and the trouble he solves is also Shane Battier's, this money can only be from Battier's private account. Inside, you can't take the public account. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Must," Sean Battier said: "You don't know my old friend. Dear Hopkins, although he never Admit, but he is a small belly chicken. The guy who cares about it - when I invited him, I didn't say that he had to help me deal with more than a dozen of the northern cockroaches... um, and the ghostly thing with eyes full - There is 'institution'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is not a member of the organization?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe Who knows, Anthony Hopkins is a poisonous snake that is difficult to control. Anyway, I think they are a bit wrong." The "institutional" people are unscrupulous in front of them. What do they think? Let Anthony Hopkins know that it doesn't matter whether he thinks he will close his mouth and not reveal a word? If it is the latter, they are right. Sean Battier and Anthony Hopkins are friends, but the friendship between them is not good enough for Battier to automatically jump into the pool of water - sometimes pretending to be dumb It’s much better than the eye, and there are many friends of Shane Battier. Of course, there are only a few who can be as smart and capable as Anthony Hopkins. So he still wants to make compensation, Anthony Hopkins must need money, he always loves to enjoy. All kinds of enjoyment, there is still a son. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have to keep a relationship with him, good relationship, who knows if there will be such a thing in the future, and..." Battier hesitated. Finally, I said it: "The 'institution' is very interested in him, all. Just related to Anthony Hopkins."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judas frowned : "'Institution'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, my child, 'institution" is more important than others, including Anthony Hopkins." Sean Battier saw Judah’s slightly surprised face and smiled smugly: “Think about the things in the 'Tianqiu’, you have no doubts, how can the insatiable sneaky ghosts loosen their mouths so easily Of course, because there is greater interest and temptation to sway in front of their eyes - a dead person is not worth letting them give up so much - I can't say too much... but do you know what is called a paired transplant? He patted the palm of his hand: "Fresh, healthy kidneys, liver, bone marrow, heart... no need to pair, as long as you need it," the casino owner screamed: "anytime, anywhere, for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wow," Judah said, he remembered Shaw. Battier’s liver, just last month, his long-term liver with alcohol and nicotine was judged as incurable by doctors, the only way to transplant, but Shawn Battier’s blood is ab2 Judas is b2 (both are rare blood types). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think I will continue to work for twenty years, then," Sean closed his eyes and said happily: "Then everything will be You inherit, my son."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's great, Dad." Judas went behind Shawn Battier: "The problem can be Yes, I don't want to wait that long."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shawn Battier The funeral was held at dusk the next day, and the Soul Mass was arranged on the same day. During the period, a series of flowing processes were not detailed. No one questioned the beautiful coffins and cemeteries that had been prepared for a long time. No one noticed that the one behind the neck of the deceased was blocked by gauze and silicone, and then covered with a shirt collar to cover the strict black hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I deeply regret this," Dr. Hopkins said to the young man with red hair: "Your father is a noble person, generous, witty Lovely, never violates the promises made by him.” He said sadly: “I thought his friendship with me could last longer.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
