			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this strange smell, it is the aroma of myrrh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The daughter and granddaughter of the sage Jarred moved out of the largest incense burner from the sacred room, pure gold, and was made into the shape of the ancient Roman monastery in Sinai. The walls are engraved with flowers, animals, saints and angels. The roof of the monastery can be opened, just like the lame devil has uncovered the roofs of all the people in Madrid to show Donkerifus the various crimes of the world, the maid of the saints. They unveiled the roof cover wearing three gold chains, and unscrupulously put a lot of expensive spices such as gold into the price. Even so, the saint Jared in bed is still cursing and urging, he is from many It began to hate odors from the beginning of the year, because in his mind, it symbolizes aging and even death. He refused to use toilets, emulating the emperors and queens of the East, using toilets with agarwood and sandalwood chips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The equipment hidden in the wall and the top of the sling is working, never blowing into the room from the gap between the cleverly decorated room to this windowless room. Fresh air with rose flowers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even so, the stench from the sage Jared is so vivid that it can be called a needle or dagger-like sharp, mellow, The spicyness of myrrh and the sweetness of the rose are just a layer of film that collapses in front of it. It is a decaying, incorrigible breath that can only be found from the dying person. As long as you smell it once, you will never forget it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sage Jerry Dehehe gasps, he is naked, his body is not as white as the alabaster, except for the black, except for the black The little devil sent the wounds left by him, and there was no trace of marks in other places, a little bit of scars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wound has been healed, the skin there has been as smooth as a baby born under the age of one year, but after a year, it suddenly appeared, deep deep. Black and black, blood and fat tumbling in the pores of muscles and bones, screaming with white foam, and the hot smell is emitted by them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take it up," said Jared. He is jealous of this healthy and magical son. He suspects that Stefan has moved his hands in the process of treating him, but now is not a good time to settle accounts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stefan quietly touched his wound, the miracle did not happen, the wound still existed, it seems to have expanded some, blackened skin to the shoulders and The abdomen spread. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," said Stefan. "It won't be good," he said in a warm voice. "You are going to die, saint Jared - I said that you can live a long life. Ah, sorry, That is what I lied to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sage sage thought that he had made a thunderous roar, in fact even the closest to him, Stefan I only heard a pig-like cockroach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heat poison polluted his blood and deprived him of his strength. Still eroding his mind. In the last hours of his life, no less than ten elders and subordinates who were loyal to him went to his bed, leaned over and put his ears in his mouth to listen to the teachings and guidance, but only got some chaotic The words describe the dying old man’s hatred of the living and the fear of death. His shackles and shackles are revealed in the broad daylight, and he curses God. Praise the devil, he screams the name of the dead man, gives orders, and remembers every treasure in his room or in the holy room. He asks people to put the piece of skin that is said to come from Saint Jakarta over him. Under the pillow, I also tried to eat a piece of sawdust – from the heel of St. Gallo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people think he will say. He did not say a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elder Josiah," asked an elder: "Do you have a way to treat saint Jared?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Josiah has already seen Jared, the man who is regarded by the Lord as the god of the earth, like a moldy orange, and this moldy spot is still going out Expand with it. This is not something that modern medicine can explain - he recruited the devil, Josiah said in his heart, he is different from the sages who have been bathed in the glory or sage of the saint Jared since birth, his Loyalty belongs to his Lord, not to humans who will be sick and dead, but he hides this very well, no one notices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the power of Elder Stefan disappeared?" Someone asked: "Or he or he was a liar from the beginning, will this disaster be incurred?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is one of Stefan's many brothers, but he is only a mediocre, shallow-minded person - he can live in this mansion Because of his enthusiasm for the worship of Hayman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stefan’s brother swallowed, he was nervous, surrounded by elders, they only need to say a word, make a gesture, you can make any A Strangjah fell straight into the hell from heaven and suffered for fifty years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he must say: "Let Heyman Elder come back," he looked around: "End his exile - he can save all beings and save our Father on the ground."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;Stefan did not speak, his eyes fell on an older woman, she pushed the person in front of her out, she raised her arm and showed a knife she was holding. Tifan's brother cringed, but it wasn't him who was hurt, but the woman—she inserted a sharp knife into her throat, and then pulled it out, blood and precious air slammed into the air. Stefan immediately grabbed her and stretched one hand to the wound on her neck. The blood rushing out swallowed his entire arm, but when his finger touched the hot and hot skin, he bleeds all of a sudden. It stopped, blood vessels, muscles and skin squirmed and healed, as they saw a year ago, the woman struggled to pull up a clean coat and wiped off the blood, letting Strangjah observe her wounds. It is as clean as new. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stefan, who responded to provocation and questioning by action, helped her to stand up: "Thank you, sister." He smiled at her, she was there. He gave him a biscuit when he was driven out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since your abilities still exist," Stefan’s brother trembled and said, "Why don't you cure the saint Jared? If you don't want to Let the person who wants come back!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even if Hayman returns here," Stefan said calmly: "He can't change what is going to happen." Anything - the saint Jared is the time to let go of the troubles of the world, sin and the skin, the door of glory has been opened to him, the wonderful fife has been played - my brothers and uncles, please prepare the holy oil, I will listen to the last confession of the saint Jared."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He almost straightforwardly said that the saint Jared is going to die, his brother stalked and looked around. But I can only find a face that Zhang Bo looks down on and is insensitive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let him rest." Elder Josiah said: "This child is just over-tired."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hyman’s believers were forced to go on a semi-mandatory basis. The holy oil had a large can in the room of the saint Jared, and there was no need to look for it. Stefan returned to the extravagant bed. He looked down at the stranger Jared, his head squatting slightly, his gray eyes reflecting the fat and smashing body, motionless, like a patient Vultures, waiting for the loss of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Repent," said Stefan. "Repent, father."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;After the seventh century AD, a group of devout monks sought the miracles of the sage of the house of Poi in the sea. They hired sailors, rented boats, and drifted on the sea for three years. One night, their ship encountered a big storm. Seeing to sink to the bottom of the sea, the monks raised their arms and prayed to their Lord and the saints. The miracle appeared. An island rose from the bottom of the sea and lifted them and their ships. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although most people believe in another way - that is, they hit the rocks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway. They were saved, and the island was named after the monks by the sage of the Poi family, who built a monastery on the island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hyman. Stronge was sent here by his brother, Harvey, or the current Elder Stefan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a deserted island, with gray-black rocks covered with moss and low shrubs that no ships will supply. The island's monks planted thin grains and vegetables in the cracks of barren rocks, caught fish in the sea, excavated shellfish, and fished seaweed and seaweed. They raised three goats. Drink their milk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They live in their own house, the building materials are taken from the island itself, it is a piece of black stone like an oyster shell, only after a simple Polished. The monks built them into a skull-shaped hut, each about 15 feet in height and 20 to 24 feet in inner diameter. Two small holes were reserved on the side for lighting, and the floor was covered with wool. Felt, it is both a bed sheet and a sheet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether day or night, there are unexpected old friends to visit them, some hairy, a long tail, with a hard shell, with hundreds Legs, some slippery, cold, and soft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No lights, no lights or oil lamps, no towels and basins for washing, only a wooden bowl for sharing in a large iron pan Fish and algae, right, and goat's milk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their church stands at the highest point of the island and is built with the same black stones. Of course, don't expect to have beautiful stained glass windows and high domes. Like the monks' dwellings, it is as simple as living for the cavemen. Only a cross engraved on the stone wall indicates that this is one of the heavenly Lord's dwellings on the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
