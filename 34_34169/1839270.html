			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lila glared at the screen, and the disappointment was overwhelming - if possible, she might launch the long, pointed eyelashes that were brushed by the mascara directly Judas thought, he had already helped Shawn Battier, and Battier had just stood firm and pushed him lightly and resolutely - just a few minutes was exciting, but he had already slowed down. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's see more clearly," said the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To control those hidden, ubiquitous probes requires a password, the password has always been known to Battier, but it is clear that the "institution" person does not I need this - a guy in a black jacket is sitting in front of a laptop with his legs crossed, and the keyboard is placed on his knees. The computer's cable is as deep as a parasite or parasitic plant. Deeply inserted into the body of the control panel that was unloaded from the outer casing, his fingers are very flexible, even the most sophisticated and agile dealers in Paradise Palace are hard to match. The countless numbers and letters on the screen that is less than a4 size are like rain. The general sloshing - the surveillance camera in the casino trembled a little, began to turn and zoomed in on some local areas as required by the new owner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he noticed Battier’s gaze, he looked up and smiled shyly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A probe that is hidden behind the hollowed-out carved decoration can be said to be leaning against the poor woman who is held up, two or three bare eyes are curiously looking With it, they found that the skin around the eyeball can also act as an eyelid. They can cover the newly grown eyeball and apply transparent body fluid on the eyeball in each coating, just like normal human blinking. At the same time, the tears will be applied to the eyeballs to ensure that they are moist. She does not politely remove body hair like other women. Although the dark hair is not as thick and long as a man, it will fold up. The skin is gathered and twisted, making it look ugly and disgusting. "Do you think they can play the role of eyelashes?" "Head" asked. ,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's the matter, are you still going to let me brush it with mascara?!" Lila said violently: "Don't tell me." We are thousands of miles away, and there is no day and night to get to this ghost place except the sand is the sun to see a strange show?! If it is just like this, she is useless to us!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course, this is not the only thing." Ivan said: "Her skill is very big, her eyes can see a lot of things, except for cards," he paused, deliberately selling a Guan, "She can still see Some ordinary people and even the versatile people may not be able to see things." He slammed the black-haired female companion's legs extremely: "Come, baby, say something interesting to hang them." Appetite."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She gave a cry. Probably Ivan’s action touched her eyes, and Sasha noticed that she was trying to close some eyes without notice – in places Iwan could not see. When the eyes are closed, the skin there is also smoothed back, and the whole process is very fast - enough for an ordinary person to rub twice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can... I can see," said the skinny woman with dark hair stuttering: "I can see the light on you - and Others are different, you have light on you - you can see it at a glance. You are the same as me." She turned her eyes - all, when such a dense sight fell on Catherine, Catherine could not control It stiffened a bit: "The light on her body is ruby ​​red and Prussian blue, both colors are very clear - she is strong, or will be strong in the future; um..." She looked at Besib: " Light and deep lemon yellow ochre."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A good color to promote appetite." Sasha whispered. Besib licked his ribs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib noticed that her gaze was always swept away from Hopkins and his son. I almost dare not stop: "What color is my brother?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"White..." The brunette woman hesitated and said: "Or... ...is light, very dazzling light."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doctor Hopkins has been listening intently and hearing this. In his eyes, he showed a childlike innocent curious look: "What color do I have?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Black." The woman said, in essence, that It is an extremely rich red color, like the deep red that is actually stacked in layers. It accumulates so much. So it looks like it is black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there a lot of tricks? My dear little monsters." Ivan scornfully said: "Shawn Battier and the little stupid cow Making the same mistakes, they always dare to use anything. They dare to do anything - they are going to hell, a group of fallen guys."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;“So,” said Dr. Hopkins, “you know what we are from the beginning.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivan stared at him for a while Shaking his shoulders, his clothes cracked a big hole in his shoulders, and Hopkins could see a part of the tattoo from the crack. "I am familiar with you like being familiar with my dog's buttocks. It’s a very interesting thing for you to stupidly make a fool of yourself.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Whether it’s silly,” Catherine said coldly: “It’s a fact that you lost. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," Hopkins said: "According to your statement, the girl around you can only see - I don't think she can see too Many things, she may be able to distinguish between the powers and ordinary people, but that's all. You get the details about us from another person, for example: green eyes?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why not red hair is too big?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because Hair Judas is the biological son of Shane Battier," Hopkins said. "All that Shane Battier has in the future is his. He doesn't have to make a mess of his own things." I smiled thoughtfully for a while: "So say - only possible. As far as I know, some people think that Shane Battier has been sitting in the position of the owner of the Paradise Palace Casino for a long time. He has no heirs. And they could bear it when they were old, but Shane Battier found Judas - his son, his heir. Those people felt very unhappy about this, they didn't want the 'king', they I only want an 'agent'. They have chosen, or rather, they have been selected when they are not yet'--an ambitious, savage young man, not a native of Las Vegas. Gass, no family, no solid foundation, no trustworthy mentor, no loyal helper, not understanding all kinds of undercurrents or unspoken rules, even though he has an uncle, or a beggar? Member's shadow After all, the force is limited. He may become the second 'Shann Battier' in the future, but at least it will take ten years. During this time, those people will be able to develop themselves safely and securely. The forces, if not, can kill him directly, it will be harder than killing Shane Battier."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s really amazing I hate the guy." Ivan whispered, "Okay," he raised his voice. "Revenwell, do you still want her?" He shook his hand: "And... this?!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
