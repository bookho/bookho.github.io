			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is another surprise attack on the Douglas family since the Ossian Douglas incident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides a few energetic, geniuses with equally developed brains and limbs, every boy or girl who wants to get an "a" in the exam will be private. Seek help from drugs, especially in highly competitive private schools. Their parents are willing to pay ten times as much tuition as public schools, that is, they want their children to apply for a good university. It can be said that universities ranked after 50 will not be seen by them. — However, it should be noted that the number of new students in these universities will be limited to one thousand to one thousand and five hundred, and they will receive less than 100,000 copies of their application materials. They want to stand out from them, except for standardized tests. In addition to your grades, your high school grades, the results of club activities (mainly the rankings you get in various competitions), sports, performance talents, fundraising, leadership, community service, etc. must have an immediate eye-opening The place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The children of the "Gifts" class are particularly hard, because they have to take credits in the ninth and tenth grades that other people can get in four years. Complete the high school curriculum, and then take the college preparatory courses offered by the University Council for the remaining two years. If they can achieve four to four or five points on these courses, they can use this transcript to obtain More prestigious universities are favored and can be exchanged directly for credits at the university. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Bessib once complained, they have to take six to seven hours a day, and he has to go to the toilet and have a short break between classes. The transfer class has to be run. Rugby training is usually three hours after the end of the course (Thursday's meditation rally) from Monday to Friday. After the training, it is homework and tutoring time. In the first semester of the ninth grade, he almost Busy every day until 11:00 in the evening or even two or three in the morning to sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is going to sing the hymn (his second club) on Saturday, all day, they have to go to church on Sunday morning, and go to the library in the afternoon. Read a book and supplement his reading. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only when he ate, he can get a little rest - whether it’s the brain or the body, occasionally taking a few minutes to hit a fixed sandbag and shooting game is already Very good pastime, when he goes out to do "business", he has to bring a suitcase of books and homework - if not there is Sasha Hopkins, he will almost kneel down and cry and pray Forgiveness of the Holy Spirit... Forgive him for being stupid and ignorant--he finally understood why the former Poseidon man would rather dance with the gun than to shoot, and he would not be a "study person". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
