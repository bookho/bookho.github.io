			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter 83 Rabbit (5)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said, I have to lie down? ?" Gucci Hefner said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," Hopkins did not hesitate to make a gesture: "What do you like, as long as you don't hinder listening and speaking." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Great," Hefner made a face: "The psychiatrist I met before liked to let me lie down, but I think I will always I can't get used to lying down in front of a man. It makes me nervous and can't relax at all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can choose a female psychiatrist."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's worse." Hefner picked a swivel chair, sitting like a 17-year-old bastard, knees on one side of the arm, toe Open and close in the air, then open again: "Soon she also lie down. Come and drink?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is a bit of a hassle. Hopkins affirmed: "Is whiskey or brandy? Or Holy Trinity (Absinthe)?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you can, Holy Trinity, Italian Doolin is still France, Switzerland, Czech Republic, Spain?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My personal secret, anise, fennel and bitterness have added mint and incense Bee flowers and nutmeg."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;", I almost have to wait."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hefner said that while swiping the swivel chair, it turned like a carousel in a children's paradise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins shortly raised his eyebrows as he walked out of the room and returned with his emerald green wine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hefner’s shoulders hang on the other side of the armrest, his head hanging down, in his eyes, the upside down psychiatrist stood in the wall In a semi-circular shape, in front of the dazzling bar, he skillfully poured the absinthe into the sugar cubes in the wine glass and the slotted spoon, and then drew a match to ignite the sugar-filled candy. The flame slammed open, and Hefner smelled the sweet smell. "At least 80 degrees," he muttered. "Bohemian drinking, doctor, you are a good person to enjoy life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sugar cubes squirmed and the color changed from snow white to golden brown. Hopkins stared at it tightly. Just like every time, he mastered a wonderful good time - it would sizzle The melted sugar is poured into the cup, and the flame is extinguished in time, and the mineral water is poured quickly. The green liquid of the grandmother turns into milky white in the blink of an eye. "How much?" He asked: "One dose (about one fluid ounce, About 30 ml), one dose and a half?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the 15 ml that is extra is water, please give me one dose."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly got his wine and immediately swallowed a big mouth: "Hey, God of all evil, is like sucking a piece of rusty brass!" He complained: "You put too much nutmeg... but it's very good, really good, Hopkins, you are a good person to create life... Do you think I can still have a cigar?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, why not? The Dutch Prime Minister, I prefer this one, very pocket-sized, Very cute."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sounding the sound of the rope. Hefner bit the tobacco buttocks, and Hopkins used his nails to make a small incision on the obese cigarette. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long match circling along the head of the cigar, thick into a group, with aroma of smoke on the men’s tongue for a while, It was gently sprayed out. They linger in the sun-filled room, and there is a wonderful sense of disobedience, because in Hopkins's impression, only the fog above the swamp in the deep winter night will float this gray-blue mist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are a likable guy, Anthony Hopkins, you are far from being as old-fashioned as you are, looking like a monk Hefner enjoyed it for a few minutes. "Now, please help me with it... Ok, thank you, I think I am falling in love with you." He was quiet for a while: "What are you looking at?" ?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins has been standing in the window, looking down motionless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look at the bird you are feeding," said the psychiatrist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hefner sniffed his nose and said: "The feathers are gorgeous, aren't they?" He dropped a piece of ash, the ash fell on the carpet, and the carpet burned. With a slight squeak and burnt smell, Hefner put the cigar into his mouth and pressed the red Mars with his thumb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mansion is surrounded by lawns, jungles and trees, but with the house as the midline, a five-foot-tall rose flower wall divides the entire area into two, with the parking space, the fountain, the statue, and the full transparency. The three-dimensional swimming pool, and the one inside is Hefner’s private territory. If the girl who has not received the task and is allowed to go out is tired of sleeping in the room or watching TV, drinking, dancing and practicing lyrics, Will come out between the lawn and the rose, take a breath of fresh air, or go swimming - on the right side of the house, below the room where Hefner and Hopkins coexist, has a thin rectangular pool. It is recessed into the ground and has three depths that can accommodate twenty people at the same time without being crowded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;April's sunshine can't be said to be hot, but the whole pool is exposed to the sun, fully accepting the heat it brings, a girl is walking The pedal, agilely turned half a turn in the air, jumped into the water. Her companions patted the water and cheered her loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other half a dozen girls obviously prefer the sun instead of the water. They are wearing bikinis, wearing sunglasses, lying on their backs or lying on the rattan couch by the pool. Relax, as if it has melted into the warm warm light of the warm ocean. Among them is Gucci Hefner's fiancee, Lilith Mayer, whose fabric is more expensive and more expensive than other girls. This year's latest style, metal texture, hollow, inlaid with tiny diamonds, even with gold Wool-like hair sparkles in the sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The swivel chair became a wheelchair after the carousel, and Hefner slid his arm on the ground like a paddle, driving a chair near Hopkins He put his head out of the window and made a groaning sound in his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you think," he sighed. "Do I have to change some fresh stuff?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Include Lilithy Meyer?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, never." Hefner said: "I am going to marry her, the devil testified." "This idea hasn't changed yet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins turned his eyes back to the pool. To be honest, Lilithaire is a beauty, if In a small town in Tennessee or a street in New York City, she can be described as fascinating and unique, but if it is here, in this beautiful, full-bodied young girl In the big house, she can't say that she is a prominent one, at least not the most prominent one. The most important thing is that she is also very old. She is 25 years old, a flower with a foot, if it is an ordinary bunny, she is at most After three more years, you have to get out of the way - this is not just for Hopkins or anyone else, Lilysme Around the girls also has a sharp spiteful eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example: Betty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe the two people’s eyes are too direct, Lilith Mayer and two more keen girls found Hopkins and Hayf standing at the window Na, one of them was Betty, who threw a big smile at the window and determined the attention of the two men—or, after a part of her attention had shifted to her, she turned back lightly and jumped into the pool. There was nothing to worry about, but after a few seconds, the girls began to scream and laugh, and Betty’s seemingly flat black bikini melted rapidly in the water, and she was naked in the pool like a little white dolphin. After swimming for a whole lap, I climbed ashore and walked unobtrusively—toward the window, and when she crossed Liliesmeer, she deliberately hit her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wet blonde is draped over the chest, the beautiful chest is looming, the water drops rushing down the elastic hips and legs, she is tall The head is raised, and the blue eyes are full of confidence in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, beautiful." Hefner said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins observes another person, Lilith Mayer, her face is terrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Betty is waiting, she hopes to get the call of Hefner, pampering and even replacing Lilith Mayer as the object of envy, she thinks she has this ability She is beautiful, she is impeccable, and she is healthy and smart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lilysmeyer jumped over before Hefner made any statement, and she gave Betty a slap without hesitation, Betty sharply miserable Screaming, Cangjie retreated, she rubbed her face in panic, crying after discovering fresh blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"婊(子!" Lily Smel yelled angrily.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other The girls looked at the show with great interest.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get out!" Lilith Mayer lowered her voice, like a cobra screaming: "Disappeared from my eyes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Betty gave the answer very clearly - she waved her arm in an attempt to counterattack.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
