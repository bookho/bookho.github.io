			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An-124 is flying smoothly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can also be regarded as a big man in a heavy transport aircraft. The cabin section is pear-shaped and is divided into upper and lower layers. The large oval cargo compartment can be loaded into one. The entire subway car, the smaller upper level is the cabin, with toilet, bath room, kitchen and 2 rest rooms, which can be used for the crew to take a break during the long flight, and there are 60 comfortable seats. Or it is necessary to take the passengers on the transport plane - not the kind of net-bag type, which is fixed on the bulkhead by hooks and fiber belts. It takes a quarter of an hour to avoid the sore temporary chair, but it is regular, 18 inches wide. The cabin seats are covered in natural leather with adjustable headrests, electric lumbar cushions, adjustable inflatable cushions and liftable armrests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this voyage, there are only 36 guests who are willing to try a heavy transport plane, and Hopkins and his son are among them, with them, It is Father Peter - he is going to Orlosa at the invitation of a friend, and his friend is now in the Eastern Orthodox Church as a monk priest, only one step away from the bishop; Pepi, than the Sangdi family Iron Taro, the father and the godfather of the family heir, with Besib; and a group of eight-person youth tour from Poseidon Island - they are just like other passengers, just want to appreciate the heavy transport plane What made it different was that it was only after buying an expensive ticket that it was on the plane. They had nothing to do with the cargo compartments below, and they had nothing to do with them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is of course lying, before the large air transport metal boxes and wooden boxes were sent into the container, Pepi, Father Peter, and their master, Cheka Le Bissand, Besib and Sasha have personally opened the box and checked the goods inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13,000 82mm mortar shells, 5,000 anti-tank rockets, one thousand Cole features four or five caliber automatic rifles, three hundred Rocket launcher and 20 million rounds of bullets. And boxes with odd-shaped components, thick and seamless titanium steel alloy steel tubes with screws, legs or brackets, pipes, pumps and valves. Gates, crawlers, tires, only those who have been immersed in this line can see at a glance what these things can be assembled - five 203 mm caliber self-propelled howitzers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cargo information is all "agricultural and chemical machinery and equipment", the An-124 responsible for transporting them belongs to an aircraft leasing and trading company, the company's boss is a The Westerners, but like many of his Westerners, he served for Chekal Bissand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plane took off from a large airport in the southern part of the continent and it took eleven hours to reach almost the northernmost Orlosa, across the entire federation. The departure time is 12 am. Arriving at Orlosa was around 11 pm, but the passengers were told that when the plane had entered Orssa, the sky outside was still bright and soft with goose eggs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The extremes of Orlosa." Besib said that there was plenty of light in the cockpit. It's hard to feel that it's late at night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This kind of extreme will last for about two months." Sasha said: "In this time, Orlosa will be a city that never sleeps. He looked down from the side scuttle of the cockpit. The clouds beneath the plane were extremely thin and the air was clean. The outline of the city of Orlosa was clearly visible. It was a regular rectangle with the same shape. The white and yellow-colored houses are densely packed next to each other. There is no large green and no blue in the middle. The road is like the grid lines on the workbook, horizontal and vertical, and each of them is framed. The places are almost the same size. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a close proximity to the city. It is a spiral-shaped gray-black crater, almost as large as one-fifth of a city. In its center, it has a dust column that is carried by a rotating airflow, which is thin and straight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's go back." Sasha said: "They are going to land."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the two big boys left, one of the aircraft engineers stood up and tried not to put the cockpit door on as urgently as possible - on any plane, the passengers were not allowed to enter the cockpit, necessary At that time, those who have the responsibility and the right to stop them can even use force, but when the plane has not taken off, they have received a notice or warning, the two boys, especially the one with black hair, what he wants to do. random. The driver and the co-pilot tightened their backs as they walked in. They were thinking about what to do if the two children asked to sit in their position - although they looked beautiful and sensible, But children of this age have a kind of energy that can't be both omnipotent – ​​who can't guess what they want to do next, fly on Mars, or get into the sewer? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, they just looked at the layout of the cockpit with curiosity, then stood on the side of the porthole to look at the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "All goes well." The driver said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everything went well," said the co-pilot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They always love to say this before taking off and landing, both as a blessing and a prayer, especially this time, except for long-term flight, man-made and natural disasters may bring In addition to the scourge, there are heavy cargo in the belly of the plane, and they are not concealed. What they are most worried about is that the plane will be forced to land as an unlucky Il 76 transport plane because of a fuselage failure. At that time, it took 38 tons of arms and was caught by the FBI. - And their An-124, with dangerous goods is twice as much as 38 tons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Orlosa Air Traffic Control Center, a senior administrator is watching the screen in front of him. At midnight, there are very few planes landing and taking off. The green square, which only represents the plane, is slowly moving here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are coming," he said, picking up his mobile phone and saying, "There is still half an hour."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;This news was immediately transferred to Constantine Cloven. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He and his subordinates had waited in the nearest hotel to Orlosa Airport the day before, and they immediately rushed to the airport after hearing the news. As he passed through the terminal, Constantine saw the An-124 landing, the black smoke behind the engine, the wheel rubbing against the ground when landing, and two white smoke dragged into the air, mixed with black smoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the An-124 was completely stopped, the tractor dragged the behemoth into the apron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The front and rear hatches controlled by hydraulics are opened in seven minutes and three minutes respectively, and the two lifting capacities of the amazing amount of cargo on the top of the cargo hold are The ten-ton crane and the three-tonne winch on the floor, together with the winch, were quickly sent out of the An-124 belly – about a hundred workers were silently busy, with a 30-foot blue The white-and-white container trucks were connected one by one, and then carried one by one with huge containers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib. Bisand and Constantine. Crovin shook hands. They didn’t have the conversation for the time being, and everyone else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goods and people bumped into a dilapidated building, the building was empty, only a narrow window, very high, white fluorescent The tube was shackled by the aluminum alloy chain and hung in the air. The worker skillfully operated the forklift to unload the metal box and the wooden box in the container and placed it on the open space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of the Cloven family opened the boxes one by one and counted the number. Constantine took a black rifle from the box and opened the magazine with a slamming. The person around him took a box from another box and he Besib looked at it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bullet smashed between the wall and the pillar, the cement block fell down, and a stray bullet hit the fluorescent tube, and the fragments of the tube were like The ice particles before the snow fell like a floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Constantin. Cloven removed the remaining bullets and put the rifle back to its original position: "Very good gun."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s all good guns," Besib said. "Every one. Do you still need to try something else?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "There will be people to try." Constantine said: "This is really a precious and huge gift."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We only Responsible for the transfer," Father Peter said: "There are others who are thankful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know if I should thank the generous husband, Crowe said that he looked at Besib and then turned to Sasha: "In any case, it is you who hand it over to us, dear friend, no accidents, no mistakes, you deserve us." Give the most sincere gratitude." He said, while making a hidden gesture, then Besib smelled a rough and strong wheat aroma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A family with a similar cross-section of An-124 has a similar family, and Kelow’s family member came up with a huge silver in his hand. On the plate, the silver plate was covered with white cotton cloth. The cotton cloth was carrying a bran bread with the whole pig's elbows. The light brown skin was opened with a knife, and the mouth was creamy and yellow. Sprinkled with fine crystal salt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please, friend," Constantine said: "I hope you don't blame us for coming too late."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bessib picked up the bread, and when he found out that the bread was hot, it was a little surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He split the whole bread into two and gave it to Sasha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bread is fresh and strong, they have used dinner on the plane, but they have to eat them all, whether it is for Besib or Sasha. It will be a difficult thing, just a little dry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
