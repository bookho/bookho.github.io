			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Hopkins before the emergence of Claude Streif, the understanding of China is not as deep as other countries - Huo Pukins has read a new survey report on psychologists from China. 21.2% of the respondents believe that psychologists are experts who can solve problems. They can go deeper and helper than friends and family. Discussing problems and helping to find ways to solve problems; 32.3% of people think that finding a psychiatrist is only a channel for emotional catharsis, because they can listen, and because they don’t know each other, they can alleviate their concerns when they talk, but they really solve the problem. You have to rely on yourself. Another 32.9% of respondents believe that psychologists are simply swindlers - Chinese are implicit, reserved, and cautious. They are not as dependent on psychologists as others. What's more, they think that mad men need psychologists. They are rarely too close to people of the same ethnicity. Even the children who are adopted by foreigners are the same. They may be as cheerful and lively as other children, but they are always a little out of place. Like black hair and yellow skin, something in the blood and bone marrow is always so ingrained and difficult to remove. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Kemira, the feeling of violation that Streif felt on her became a place where it can be said that only Chinese people More intense. She was arranged to walk with Streiff, but the dark green eyes cast a sight that rarely touched her peers, like the bamboo forest outside the gallery, the lanterns under the gallery, the gloomy wooden walkways and the streams along the aisle. Even the koi in the stream is more attractive than the people around it; she rarely does not speak, unless it is necessary, but even if she speaks, the voice is light and thin; the movement is slow, elegant, and the shoulders are slightly drooping - but she is still It has a fluffy bun and white skin that is radiant even under faint light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They went inside instead of a short section, the room that entered was at the end of the corridor, the room was large, and the windows with a full wall were outward Open, they are made up of slender wooden strips arranged in a regular pattern with glass in between, a shimmering lake outside the window, and an innumerable lotus leaf near the window. Several branches almost reached the window, showing that at least one-third of this room is below the lake, what a special whimsy! Streif said in his heart, he immediately noticed the table in the room, which was about four feet in diameter, with a snail-shaped rosewood round table, and twelve chairs of the same texture and form. His sharp nose can clearly sniff To the elegant and gentle aroma they radiate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please sit down," Kaisheng said to Streif, then turned to Kimila: "Take care of the little guests." Streiff noted that He spoke to Kemira with a commanding tone. Kemira heard the words immediately and lowered her head, revealing a slender neck, which is a symbol of yielding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kemira was arranged next to her mother (they should have no blood relationship, the wife of Kaisheng State is also a pure Chinese), her left is Sasha, a few soft silk satin mats on his chair and Between the gaps, he was not placed in front of the egg white porcelain used by others, but a small set of silverware, spoons, bowls, and dishes. On the left side of Sasha was Claude Streif. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appetizer is very delicate and light, but it is delicious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While waiting for the meal, the two waiters were carried into a flat wooden box, which was placed on the carpet and opened with a damp bag, one The waiter carefully lifted the corner of the pouch and let everyone see what was inside - two snakes with the thickness of an adult wrist. The black scales are interspersed with white spots and triangular heads. When the young men sitting close to the door position nodded, they carefully re-apply the pouch, close the wooden box, and slowly quit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Viper, you call it white python, today we choose salt and pepper," said the young man sitting next to Streif: "They are human The body has great benefits, and it is also very delicious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Streif agreed, but this dish needs to wait for nearly half an hour. Because snakes need to be slaughtered, peeled, and cleaned...but that doesn't mean they have to wait stupidly. There are all kinds of delicious foods sent in. The waiters show off the wonderful form of the dishes. Go to everyone's plate. What impressed Sasha was a green dish. The vegetables were peeled away and only the heart of the cabbage was left. The inside was filled with fresh fish and the soup was poured outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the white python, there are other things, such as fish, shrimp and crabs, which are all brought alive and invited to watch them. Into a dish. After tasting a fish dish that still swayed the clams and caudal fins, the snake was sent up, and then each person had a shark's fin, a translucent, golden ochre silk fish bone, and Sasha curiously tasted it. The soup is very viscous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The shark's fin is heavy and the child can taste it." Kaishengguo's wife said that her English is very good, and there is no accent. But the tone is slow, "Try the bird's nest porridge, add a little milk."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha thinks that bird's nest porridge is more like a pudding, especially after adding milk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dessert Dessert is a watermelon tart filled with fresh fruits of various colors. The surface of the watermelon clam is engraved with bats and bamboo joints. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an unforgettable meal. Size Streif thinks so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am very happy to hear such an evaluation," said Kai Shengguo. "There was always someone who was always worried about such a meal. He thought that half of them were It is full of barbaric and cruel toxins."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Street has noticed that Kemira, who is separated by a seat, is beginning to feel uneasy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think," he said with sincerity: "Humans have the freedom to choose to love food."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, Mr. Streif," Kemira whispered in a hurry: "I am sorry, Mrs. Boro "She nervously rubbed her fingers: "She mentioned you to my father..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't matter." Streif responded kindly. "Maybe you are willing to give me a detailed explanation after returning to school?" He nodded to the group of people who were not far from them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kemila showed a helpless look, and she went to Stewart with a worries and said goodbye, and turned back to the side of Kaisheng. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The street in the seventh district is not over yet, the crowds are surging, the dark sky is illuminated by the colorful lights, and the carved "plaque" is over the sky. There are hanging fluorescent tubes that are bent into a cloud shape with two huge square characters in between. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is that?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mid-Autumn Festival." Treff read this in Chinese The pronunciation of the two words then explained: "The Chinese choose to reunite the family on this day."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taxi Sending Steffe and his son to a place a mile away from their home stopped, and Streiff didn’t like to let strangers approach his territory. He put Sasha back on his shoulder, Little Sasha Already asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A quick walk for a mile is a breeze for Streif, and five minutes later he has stepped into the edge of the woods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woods at night were not quiet, the breeze blew through Streiff’s ears, and he heard the suppressed screams of the bull terriers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bull Terrier is a dog that doesn’t like noise very much. Even if you meet an enemy, it will only make a short, low-pitched sound. A few seconds, that is, waiting for you to hear the sound of it, you have been bitten by it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the most powerful proof that Anne Kent or Fanta Wharton have been sleeping in the wetlands of the offshore wetlands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bulls are screaming more and more densely, full of fear. Out of loyalty, they can't escape, but obviously something is threatening their lives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steve is walking silently and quickly in the woods like a hurricane or a shadow cast by a cloud, before he walks out of the woods, he is light Lifting his arms lightly, Shasha climbed up a leafy apple tree like a little squirrel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hid himself behind dense foliage and focused on the situation outside the woods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of their house, half a dozen bull terriers are confronting a young human man, and Streif gently walks behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly turned back, and the ornaments hanging around his neck glowed in the moonlight: "It’s amazing," he said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It should be me to say this." Streif said softly, with a lingering remnant: "What are you doing here? Want Stealing, or robbery? I should probably report it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just came to see." The young man shouted, he didn't seem to notice Stout at all. Leif's hostility: "I moved in not too long ago, maybe you still don't know, I am Hillenos Somitre, a veterinarian."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He relaxed his shoulders and his hands fell naturally: "I am just curious, sir, you have so many bull terriers, I just want to observe, how do you make them get along with each other?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
