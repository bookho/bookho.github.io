			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What did you see?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine turned and her face was full of doubts And restlessness: "It's hard to describe," she replied abruptly. "I think...what went wrong? I don't know... what should I say."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to the truth," said a savage guy, scorning his head scornfully, while a hand was inserted between his legs and grabbed it in a disgusting manner. Obviously, he was not prepared. Conceal your rudeness and distrust - especially for this woman in front of you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the end of last year, some eccentric speeches that are not conducive to Catherine are spreading rapidly within the organization, which is more rapid and difficult to control than the fire in the African grasslands in September. - No, maybe it can't be said that it is a simple gossip, because most of it is true and correct - Catherine does have a sister who worked at the FBI, and her sister did participate in the hunt." Ghoul's action - incredible, this stupid woman turned out to be the "prey" of the "prey", God's briefs, this does have something; even worse, they still get There was a little hybrid, and Catherine couldn’t help but see the little hybrid. She loved him, just like she had born Sasha Hopkins – so don’t blame others for guessing she was Not like her sister, she fell in love with the bloodthirsty madman who was in the third place. - Jack is dead, Bud is dead... More people are dead, Anthony Hopkins is still at ease, doing whatever he wants. - Some people accuse the upper class of the organization of being too generous in carrying a heavy suspicion of Catherine. As they mean, even if they want to use the power of Catherine, they can't make her too good. For example, it is better to light her clothes. Put a mark on the buttocks, then put on a collar full of barbed, the chain is connected to the chain, and the end of the chain is inserted into the stone manger - she can eat, sleep and sleep there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, she still has to do it - just like they have approved this beautiful girl will not make any tricks, Abel thought, Those guys are as stupid as those who spread rumors. Every member of the organization should have a deep understanding of the importance of intelligence. Catherine doesn't even need to lie. She just gently, "inadvertently" skips some details... after all, People can know what she has read from the evidence and witnesses (dead or alive), maybe just a cigarette butt, a gesture, a subtle look, can judge the life and death of a member or even the entire task. Success or failure - if she does, will the agency punish her? It is possible that her bank account will be frozen, she will be suspended, placed under house arrest, severely accused, and cuts in diet... but that's it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The special and extremely useful ability like Catherine is the first time it appears. It is hard to say whether it will be there in the future. Even if there is, Catherine’s preciousness will not drop too much – unless the ability is similar Like a mushroom after the rain, go out in batches - it will be the end of the world. Abel was shocked by his own imagination. But the organization will not do anything for Catherine. In fact, she is not flattering, especially the upper class. For them, this detached, taciturn girl is too naive, self-willed, self-righteous, and too good at Self-assertion, she is not an obedient dog, or a weapon that can hold people in the palm of her hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Speak," said the head gently, throwing a butter-filled toffee into his mouth, and the rich fragrance suddenly spread out. In the hospital bed, Bonnie couldn't help but sniff her nose. She hadn't touched the water and food for seven hours. She told the nurse that she was hungry, but the latter just gave her a bottle of glucose: Say, "The head chews candy: "Whatever we need, we all need it." Damn traffic blocked, they waited for three hours on the highway! It’s awkward. If it was two years ago, he had the right to call the helicopter of the institution “Babel Tower” anytime and anywhere. Now, he needs to apply and wait for the application to be approved before he can apply to transfer the helicopter. Bless, if no one is ahead of him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all thanks to Anthony Hopkins! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine was silent for a while, she opened her eyes and looked a bit uneasy: "I saw them."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She saw Anthony Hopkins and Sasha Hopkins, but unfortunately, except for the growth of Sasha Hopkins, she received almost no information. Value - Size Hopkins stands on the sun-drenched lawn of the mansion, smiling, standing like a camera lens, waving his right hand with his own characteristics, only moving his wrists, elbows not moving - Other than that, there is nothing, no traces of recourse, no words indicating the source, no words and actions that leave a little impression. In Bonnie’s brain, something about Hopkins is cleaned. Clean, a little bit left, just give her - Catherine can be sure, that is a photo of an activity left for her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was frightened and her voice was weak. She didn’t know if she could convince her companions. Do they doubt her intention to conceal Hopkins’s crimes and whereabouts? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said that it doesn't work." Sam said that he is a clever young man, tall, big belly, lips like two small red sausages: "We know who has been there - Anthony Ho Pukins, even with the unlucky child, we want to know more, why, when, where, where did he go?" He spread his hand: "You can't, yes, not me, man. We, maybe you really have two things. I have heard that one of my colleagues has worked with you in a case. He said that you are all superman, some can fire, some can go to heaven, and Several can rely on the nose and tongue to catch the wicked fugitives - and I hope that I can work with you, so I will bring you here," he said with disappointment; "The result is obvious, dear, you get A half-hanging psychic came to joke with me. Well," he waved his hand: "No matter what the game, we stop here, then our work, a normal, questionable answer." News..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let me try again!" Catherine clenched her fist and her lips trembled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No." Angrily retorted: "There is only one living person in the whole scene, and you know that the memory of the witness, the clearest and most understandable memory may only It can last for 24 hours and is easily misled by the error messages provided. We have wasted the most important opportunities and time. I think it is enough. Now, please go out."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...you have to cooperate with us..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"I have already cooperated, gentlemen, ladies, please. Go out. Go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Damn..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a minute," a faint voice suddenly inserted into it, and people turned their eyes to the other end of the room. Bonnie sat up and her fingers gripped the sheets tightly. "What happened? What is it - there is only one living person?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Annoyed with a sigh of relief from the nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunny girls are in the middle of the night, about four in the morning Back to the mansion, they first discovered the fallen down on the landing, the unconscious Bonnie, then Lilith Mayer, and Gucci Hefner curled up on the stairs. It is worth mentioning that the police are identifying Lilith The identity of Mel and Gucci Hefner has gone through a lot of twists and turns, and the two unfortunate victims have undergone such a big change - they have spent a rush in their lives in just a few hours, forensic examinations Their bodies can be sure that their cause of death is organ failure caused by aging - because Monica Gucci also suffers from rare "premature aging", the police have suspected that this terrible time may not be artificial, even on the landing It is covered with bullets and shells that are difficult to explain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was something that was hit by them. But the police can't find that. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others that make this terrible accident seem less common are probably only the bodies scattered in the courtyard of the mansion, two males, one female, male The peripheral guards, women are the rabbit cover girls of the month, cute and windy, little Betty, their deaths are quite consistent - deadly currents pass through their bodies, two of them are almost completely black, The uniform was gone, the muscles were dry, and the brain evaporated. Betty was lucky. She died very quickly and simply. Only two small red spots were on her smooth skin. She looked like she was asleep. The red/naked/naked lie on the grass, eyes looking at the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She had sex/relationship with people before she died." The forensic doctor said: "More than once, she was seriously injured, it was quite rude. Guy, she may have been coerced."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ghouls change their tastes?" Sam flipped through the information in his hand: "He never forced before the end of the century." Women, of course, there are no men. He enjoys their body, liver, pancreas, or loin, but they are not sexual. Some experts think that he is a monk with spiritual cleanliness... I mean, before he was arrested by you. Has he expressed any interest in this area?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine moved her lips, and Abel, standing next to her, immediately grabbed her arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head looked at them inadvertently and glanced at them. "We have to communicate with each other," he peeled the sugar paper: "Let's see Bonnie, we Give you the information."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sam shrugged: "Have a good rest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is shaking Out of the temporary foothold of the members of the organization. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Anthony Hopkins won't do that." Catherine said, almost can't wait. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I’m so glad that you know him so well.” The head calmly and intently bites the soft candy: “Ah, lemon sandwich...” He did A grimace: "So what do you want me to say? Tell Sam who is stunned by us, killing the two guards and the strong/violent and killing the little girl/woman is not Anthony Hopkins. , but the members of the organization, that is, among us... one?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
