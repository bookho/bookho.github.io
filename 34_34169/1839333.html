			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A silver Mercedes sailed away from the broad and flat highway, turned to a side road with only two cars in parallel, and then turned from a branch road to a branch Rugged dirt roads, both sides of the dirt road are higher than the shoulders, green and green corn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This car, which is rare here, caught the attention of young people: "Look at the car," he said to the father who walked with him. Said: "It's so beautiful. If I have such a car, Mana will definitely be willing to go to the movies together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His father listens The rustling of the corn leaves, like the friction of the crepe, ignored him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where do you think they will go?" asked the son happily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know," said the father. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If he goes straight down, after a few minutes, he will go to 'the place'." The son boldly said, "The place "It’s a wasteland, about twenty miles away. There is a warning sign of "private territory" on its edge, but he has never seen anyone except two loyal guards. Buy it. The person seems to have forgotten it. He neither built a factory on it nor planted grapes inside. He kept it as it was, motionless, letting the weeds grow, and the fields were ridiculous. When the young man was still a bare-headed urchin, he fought a few daring gangs to climb into the expedition. They were running in the wild grass that was about to drown half of the body, waving their arms, screaming and screaming in their In the imaginary, the shackles and shackles hidden between the grass stems and the grass roots are sinister and deceitful enemies. The young warriors are going to drive them out without a leak. The children have been running to the long-lost The stone house stopped there. Before the guards came over and blew them away, he found a few brass shells full of rust spots under a stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They went home and slammed a fight, which was heavier than any previous one. The adults sternly warned them because the place was Unlucky, dirty. The men mentioned that it was going to spit, and the women were screaming across the chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the owner of the land wanting to develop it?" The young man said that he hoped so, no matter what the owner of the land intended How to deal with it. It is good for them. If it is a factory, he can go in and work. The vineyard will also need a lot of labor. Even if he is whimsical to open a hotel here, when the guests in the hotel are leaving, They can also look for opportunities to sell their own small pieces to them - those who come from big cities look fresh, see what they want to buy, his hands are very clever, his mother's room is full of him The masterpiece of the statue of Jesus, a thin strip of corn poles. Lifelike insect specimens, roots carved into bowls and pots, and necklaces made of nut husks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't dream," his father rudely broke his dream: "The curse on the ground can't be eliminated even after a hundred years - those dolls... poor dolls..." He whispered, oh He said. Like being afraid of what awakened, desperately spit on the ground until the water in his mouth was completely spit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "From here on, we will use it." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Hopkins said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pulled his son’s hand and took him forward, the silver Mercedes was left behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wide roads have been annihilated by weeds, shrubs and small trees, and some of the tall trees on either side of the road have been dumped. More often, it shows the vitality far beyond the warm-blooded species. They are alive, leafy and ingrained, and the dark gray canopy covers the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, Anthony does not need to open the Palace of Memory. I can also recall how he ran in these dark green shades, knee-length shorts, bare upper body, and a pair of good lambskin boots on his feet - the slate on the road was clean and hardworking. The gardener will go back and forth every day. Pulling out the new grass from the crevice, he gave the tender grass to the cook, and the cook raised a group of yellow-ball-like chicks. The chickens loved this and she crushed it. The grass was thrown directly on the muddy ground of the black scorpion. The green grass exudes a pungent smell. The chickens carry the suffocating air of the eggshells, and the crowds are crowded with a large group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of suffocating he also smelled in his sister’s body, the nanny put water in the copper basin, let the sun heat them, and then the pudgy little girl Put it in the basin and ask her brother to look after her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He picked the eggplant from Sasha. The eggplant is hot and soft. He holds the eggplant like a hand holding a sand. Sasha's memory in his life is always hot, chubby, even on the last day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When did the eggplant not have it? In the spring of the following year, when the eggplant had not come to the head, the war broke out. Their country was small, rich, and without a strong alliance. His father was worried about listening to the radio by the fireplace, hostile. The country attacked them, and the friendly countries were attacking them. The interior was still in the process of mutual conflict. At most, the small land whistled with bullets from five countries, and the soldiers’ blood instead of rain watered the scorching land. Their king insisted on the long time that his weak and slender body could persist, quietly abandoning the country that had been looted in the early spring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their manor is just a small farm, but all kinds of animals, dogs, horses, sheep, cattle, workers, gardeners, grooms, butlers, cooks, nannies, the first to disappear is the man of the prime, because the army needs to add new blood, then young The woman was also requisitioned, and the cattle and sheep were taken away. The cheese-colored, superb hound was cooked into a dog broth. Anthony’s father was left behind because his arm was injured in his early hunting. He and Anthony The mother disappeared on the way to the city to snoop on the news and purchase essentials. Some people said that there was a robbery on the road, and they could not find the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Humpback's groom and his wife's wife stayed in the manor to take care of two young masters. The farm has eaten very little, the black in the field. Wheat, buckwheat, potatoes and corn were wiped out by hungry soldiers before they were ripe. The groom replaced the gardener's work. He pulled up the little grass from the middle of the road and the two sides. They used to feed the chicken. Mixed in the corn soup, there is no chicken to feed anyway, and there is a grass, a kind of weed that spreads on the ground and spreads for several miles. Its stem is in the superficial soil, pulled up, one For the festival, peel off the outer thin, the inside is white, sweet, and its unsent flower spikes can also be eaten; there are chicken grass, leeks, dandelions and rose twigs... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Hopkins walked calmly, his hand on the shoulder of the sand, the stems and roots of the weeds broken under their feet crack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The farm has no gates, only a low wall, two black cast iron doors, who were later removed in one night, it is The real iron can be exchanged for bread. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The low wall embraces a quiet, once beautiful courtyard, with a square pond with white, flesh-colored and snow-blue water lilies At the edge of the pool is a large piece of yellow trumpet narcissus. The scaffolding is not far from the light purple vines, white and red roses, and roses. Their thorns are black and long, sharp and sharp. You can bring the fruit to the fork, and the flowers they open are as big as the small face of the sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were all unplugged later, just like the eggplant, cucumber and tomato that the cooks raised, because there are always people who want to eat, one who puts the water lily The roots were all hollowed out. He thought that it was the same thing as the root of the lotus flower, that is, the lotus root. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They drained the water from the pond and wanted to dig the frogs and mud from the mud to eat, but there were only one or two wild fishes, the cook And the groom had already turned over the pond. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
