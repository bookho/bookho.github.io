			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins said in a soft tone: "You have a sincere heart."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Hefner paused for two or three seconds to determine if Hopkins was sarcasting him. "I think you know that I was divorced twenty years ago."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins nodded, and Hefner asked again: "Do you know why?" "The character is not right, I guess," Hopkins said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't care enough about me," Hefner sorrowfully accused: "You have lost your job, my new doctor, you should know me well." He raised his hand and drew a circle: "My past, my present, my future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not your lawyer, not yours Financial adviser, not your executor," Hopkins replied meticently: "I am just your psychologist, I just need to listen, are you willing to say now, if you are willing to say, I am listening here. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hefner is a bit undecided, but he really drank three holy ones, pumped more cigars, wormwood, nutmeg and tobacco. The things of the past are deposited in his stomach, and the top of the stomach goes up. He feels he has to say something, or he will explode: "I was only twenty when I first got married. Here. I used to serve for twenty-four months," he raised a hand and motioned Hopkins to give him a drink: "From Born to 18 years old, I have been staying in a small town in the south of the capital, Palermo. The town is very small and has no fame. It relies mainly on several boats and three hundred hectares of olive groves around it." Hey, Huo Pukins looked up, and he did not make a mistake. Hefner had all the unique strange smells, the fish, the dregs of olive oil, and the smell of gunpowder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Marlene, like me, grew up in that small town. She is very beautiful and very smart. I have been with her since the age of fourteen. I promised to wait until I was an adult, and I will marry after serving the military service." Hefner took a small bite of absinthe, pressed it under the tongue, and the sun shining from the window hugged him. The man from the small fishing village could not help himself. Closed his eyes, he left his hometown for more than 30 years, everything is still remembered so clearly, gray-blue small pier, white sand beaches, steep and sparsely stoned coasts, high and low undulating roads , narrow streets, balconies with flowers, walls painted with golden ochre houses, maroon roofs, turquoise olive groves and fuchsia olives, and marlena, the skin of the peasant, her skin Unlike other girls who are ruddy and brown, her exposed calves, arms, neck and face are as white and lubricated as ceramics, and there is a burning scent on every part of the body: "Back to home second On Sunday, I went to visit my parents with my uncle and took a gold necklace and asked them to marry her daughter. At first they were a little hesitant...” Hefner grinned: “I thought this was Part of the old custom comes from the little martyrdom of the woman's parents - yes, I insist on marrying Marlena, and finally they agree."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins turned and leaned against the window sill. The sun was covered by him. His body was surrounded by a circle of furry golden light. The glass was put back on the bar, and the slender fingers crossed. Placed on the abdomen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know why they are always so worried after marriage - Marlene is not."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hopkins listened patiently, motionless, he had a hunch, and soon there will be interesting parts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I never suspected that Marlena was not a." Hefner said with a gloomy voice, he threw the empty glass on the carpet, on a white carpet. A dark stain appeared immediately: "I have been... like her. Before I joined the army, we have kissed under the olive tree many times, but I have never crossed the thunder pool. I love her and cherish her, and Keeping in mind the agreement - I fulfilled my promise, I did not touch other women before entering the wedding room, even if I was laughed at and despised by the folks in the army - but I dare to take my father and mother The grave swears, I am clean, I vow to be loyal to my wife, my marriage, my children, but what have I got? Concealing, deceiving, juggling, yes, just juggling, she and she My parents succeeded in turning me into a well-known clown, as well as those in the town, the horse in the bakery, the Giliya in the butcher shop, the Koros in the Post Office, my uncle Giotto, They all know that it’s clear, no one can mention I, they just watched a 20-year-old little idiot who was so boring and happy that he was together with a stray singer at the age of fifteen, and also used the sorrow of his tires as the Virgin Mary. Welcome to enter the house."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you did not immediately divorce her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No No, no, Hopkins, I didn't want to divorce her at the time.” Hefner said with sincerity, “Although I am suffering, I really love her, I thought I could persist” And she said that she thought that things had never happened, she was still the innocent little girl - she admitted that she loved the man, but she also admitted that she was too stupid at that time, she was the face She is also a victim of her sleazy inner-minded guy... She swears on the ground and swears to me that she will never betray me and our marriage again... What can I say, what to do, I am a Coward, I forgive her.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but me I can't live in the town. Everyone knows the dirty things of Marlene - think about it, what will they say behind the back? Poor fool Hefner! I hate to see those sympathetic and smug eyes, really Damn! For a while, I thought I would burst out like Mount Vesuvius, drowning everything with grayish white smoke and fiery magma, I, and my shame, let Marlene and the whole town in a flash It turned into ashes - if there is no Tang, maybe I will do it - Tang is a good person, he gave me the job, this career, I will be grateful to him for life, may God bless him" Hefner stood up from the chair and kissed the ring on his hand: "I have been here, I have a new life, and I have a daughter with Marlena. I am famous, I have succeeded, and my hands are gathered." I can't imagine the wealth, then these wealth brought me power, and the power knocked me the celebrity door... You have to admit, I did a good job. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins nodded. Gucci Hefner was a true legend. Even though he had Don’s support, the support was not so strong and solid at first - everyone knows, rabbit The first issue of the magazine was hand-finished in the kitchen, each with only five cents, the quality is not good, the content is complicated but unattractive, if it is not a move, the use of Hefner is bold, and it is known as "sexy little". The cat's star ** makes a cover and pulls the page, this congenitally small bunny may have died in the nest before he started. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, this magazine sold nearly 60,000 copies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gucci Hefner has successfully taken the first step, the next thing is much easier, the magazine cover and the pull page girl exchange every month The age limit is between 18 and 21 years old. Every girl who has been selected must have the same temperament, healthy and full-bodied. She has never been in the past, nor has she ever been a topless girl or a stripper. It must not be a drug addict or a drunkard. Rabbit photographers look for objects from the streets, campuses, and beaches. They have a lot of money and a chance to climb the sky. Few girls can refuse, and even some people will recommend themselves. Later, Gucci Hefner created a bunny girl, opened a club, Bringing the stock of rabbit companies to the market...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hefner’s career is booming, and his marriage is inversely proportional. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He almost started to squat on the first day of his foothold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe many people think that I am ruthless and shameless, but every night I think, why should I relocate a woman who once betrayed me?" Nana walked around the house and waved her arms. "Although she has been very self-sufficient after marriage, she is considerate and addictive to me, and gave me an angel-like daughter, but I always remember uncontrollably before. The thing, when I thought that her body was touched by others, I was disgusted, and her deception and shame brought me... and so on, I couldn’t bear to stay in a room with her and hear her voice. Seeing her face, breathing the same air... Why can't I choose a better one? This thought is like a bee turning around in my head all day."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He emphasized his fists in a big way. "I decided to change my wife." He suddenly shook his head. "Do you believe it?" Hefner said: "I didn't make this decision very much. Happy, but life is alive, there is always something to lose." He shrugged Shoulder: "And I have given her marriage, the child's right to visit, two seaside houses, considerable cash, and she can get a supplement that increases or decreases with inflation every year, even if I am already dead." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
