"For the people of the Western continent, the Nepalese only have one face."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanny's boy is standing on the boxing ring, his opponent is standing up from the folding chair, it is a black man, the skin is bright, and the black one almost makes people think that he has bones and blood. It is the same color. The face is childish, the round nose, thick lips and curly short hair indicate that he is from a little more south. His height is close to that of an adult, and he has a beautiful muscle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is that a child?" Amp asked: "He is more like a father than me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Only 14 years old." Pepi savours the ale of his own, and eats the French fries provided free of charge in the gym. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp made an incredible face, "This is the case," he said. "The little dwarf can't hit him even if he straightens his arm." Head, he can almost kiss his jiba directly!" He turned to Besib and Sasha: "Who was he playing with in the last game? Is it also a giant?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The opponent he had last time was a girl," Sasha replied: "He killed her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So then you think this time Who will win?” Ampere continued to ask: “I want to make a note.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Below on the other’s body.” Xi Bu said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even if he was miserable?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Children’s boxing match only per round One minute, and in these sixty seconds, the Nepalese boy has been knocked down twice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even if he was detained very badly." Besib said: "He and his opponent have the most essential difference."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that the game of disparity is the most prone to accidents," Pepi said, pinching the beer can, "especially it involves a lot of money. Time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they heard someone screaming involuntarily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About Besib and Sasha, no one can understand what happened just now. Some people stared blankly, but they could only see that the boy of Tani was madly fighting back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He kicked him and spit in his eyes," Besib said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Than's boxer is not the fist, but the leg," Pepi said: "In the country of his own. In the boxing match, you can use the double. The kick of a leg, an adult boxer, can directly cut a bamboo of the same diameter as his calf. They are very fast. Some people say that it is like being bitten by a poisonous snake."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who yell at them are the coaches of black boys. He also failed to see too many things like everyone else. But he can still curse the Nepalese and accuse him of intentional fouls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The referee lazily walked over, separated them, then turned around to ask the black boy’s coach if he needed to give up the game because his boxer’s eyelid was beaten Broken, and the situation of the ankle is not objective - "looks like it is broken, he can't stand up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanny boy standing in the boxing ring On the other hand, he calmly confronted his fist. His gloves were stained with blood, and his face and shoulders were sorely hurt. But that's okay, this is the last game of the day, and soon he will be treated, with delicious food and comfortable beds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He played very well and was willing to follow the coach's arrangement to win or lose. Therefore, in the same Tani children's boxing hand, he got the most money and the best treatment. He slept in a room alone, he could go to the hospital, write letters to his family, and send money. You can also play an hour of video games under the supervision of the coach when there are few events. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His name today is a letter, but his real name is another. Fortunately, most of the time he is still called another, he likes this name because Hanuman, who has four faces and eight hands, is also a monkey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monkey gods are vast and able to catch the clouds. Capturing the sun and moving the mountains, it also helped the prince Rama to fight against the devil, Lobo, and rescued Wang Hao, who was compassionate and brave. The people of Thani respected it as an academic imparter, and the asylum of the farmer--the other mother gave him the name, hoping that the boy with this name would be able to obtain the shade of Hanuman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe she is right. No child can be smarter than others, strong and powerful. He can wrestle with the cows, catch monkeys in the trees, bite the snake's head, work all night, and not tireless the next day. A charity volunteer taught him to write. He learned 500 words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The volunteers promised that he will come back before leaving, he is willing to adopt another, and let the West to learn more words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He left when the summer just started, the other brother was sent back on the third day, half-length, one eye, the other brother is a boxer. The young man who sent him back asked his mother for a large sum of money, because the other brother’s medical expenses were paid by the coach. He gave another brother a life, and now he has to recover more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What else can you have in your home? They have no land, another brother has never been able to send money back, his father is dead, the other mother is too old, his sister is only two years old, and his brother is still a baby. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, he can punch, and when a young man laughs, he rushes to interrupt his ribs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other two were half-dead, but in the end the man who made the decision took him away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you stay at home, can you wait for the volunteer to come back? If he complies with the promise, and is his family better than it is now? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know, he only knows that he doesn’t come out, then his two-year-old sister and a baby’s brother will be taken away by those people. There are places where even small children and babies can "work". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another half-year of training, a year of punches in his Nepalese, and a two-year boxing in the Western Conference. The coach allowed him to communicate with the family. In the first reply, the other mother told him that his brother died the day after he left home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this early hunch, when he left home, he finally glanced at his brother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is another secret, he didn’t tell anyone, even his mother and best friend – as long as he focused on someone, The body of the person will shine through the sun, the young people are bright, the old man and the child are weak, but some young people will be as dark and gloomy as some clouds, and those places are not hurt. not too good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the boxing ring, this is very useful, many of the boxers have old injuries, just can't see. They don't even know it. As long as he stares at these places, he can always defeat them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was beaten more than once - he realized that the coach would not treat them at all, and his brother was wiped clean at most - He used to think that he would die in a flesh and blood, like the companions who were thrown in the corner of the tent. But no, he lived again and again. The coach thinks he is a useful good boy. He has gained more resources and experience. The other names are known by more and more people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the blessing of the monkey god Hanuman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is here, here is as clean and beautiful as the volunteers described, the food is plentiful and delicious, even the water is sweet, clear, he takes More money is coming. Maybe in a few years, he can buy a house here, like the boxers who are in newspapers and magazines, pick up the mother, sister and brother, and the family will live fast. Live happily together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close your eyes again. In his imagination, he has reunited with his loved ones and lives together in a magnificent room like the Heavenly Palace. Eat the curry made by my mother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When another person was found standing in front of him, looking down at him sleeping in a blanket, he was not too alarmed. He didn't hide himself and didn't know what it was. He could walk in and out at any time, and he would come with someone. Sometimes he was the host of the gambling game, and sometimes he was a curious and rich gambler. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides sitting cross-legged in the middle of the bed, watching Sasha Busy and busy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give us a place to talk." The bed is an old cast iron bed. There were tiny beams and columns to hang the bill, and Little Hopkins took less than half a dozen sheets from the front desk of the hotel, and now he is busy hanging the sheets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib looked at his bed and turned it into a white square box. "Do you think this would be more suitable for conversation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are not here to talk," Sasha said. He pushed the Westbour, pushed him out of position, and then pulled him to lie with himself, his shoulders on his shoulders. "Bishb, you know that I... like you, there is power - But my strength is different from yours."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bessib nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha Hopkins established his own memory house with the guidance and help of his father Anthony Hopkins, which may be the world One of the safest places, but he can't talk to Besib there, because the memory palace is completely undefended for his father, he can step in there and know any one stored there. secret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their next conversations are not known to third parties, no matter what method they use, they don’t want to attract the attention of anyone. So Sasha can only take a small risk and establish a temporary memory palace in a short time - if that's the case, it's not too bad. The problem is that he still has to find a way to get Besib. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope you can still remember - Besib, do you remember that we watched a movie together? It is called the Pirates of Dreams, an old movie. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remember," Besib replied quickly: "I like the Beretta, I can add a silencer, and Burley." Tower 92f and g3sg1, and you keep on licking me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because you always fight in key places... well, I am fast now Let me talk to you, I will construct a space, this is my first time to structure the memory space, and invite another person besides my father... so..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't set it too complicated, because it's somewhere and the dream space A dream... It will be a bit like, for example... When you are in it, you can’t question this space.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
