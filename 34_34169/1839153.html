A beautiful little angel. A beautiful, fragile little angel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jamie smiled from the bottom of his heart. He dared to take the oath of his mother's grave. This little guy would impress many people, and he would cause a sensation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jamie took a step forward and now he is very close to Sasha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come on," Jamie said sweetly. "Come on, cute child, you are so lucky, we decided to release a hostage first - indicating Our sincerity. Can you understand my words? One person, he can go home first," he opened his arm. "But there is only one. Who is coming?... What?...Bold, your mom and dad are Waiting outside for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The children's eyes widened and their sleepiness disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody has a little fat Avery's movements fast, Sasha didn't have time to catch him - he jumped out, his movements were like frogs With a collision with Sasha, the girl next to Sasha caught the latter in time, otherwise Sasha’s head is likely to come up with such a guy on the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Avery!" she screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the relationship he had been sitting on before, Avery’s legs were not as obsessive as he imagined, he fell, and his nose blossomed on the hard slate floor. But the desire to go home defeated the pain, and he hurriedly climbed up and rubbed his nose with his cuffs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let me go," he eagerly but chaotically shouted: "I am a good boy, God testifies that there are no better children in the world than me!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood rushed out of his nose, the sleeves couldn’t absorb them all in a short time, and some of the blood fell on the black On the floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He lied." The girl shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe." Jamie tried to shrug, but the action was a little difficult for him, his shoulders and neck were tightly connected together: "Return Someone? What about you?" He stared at Sasha: "How are you? Are you a good boy--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly closed his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deep blue iris shimmers with deep red light, and Little Strath's eyes look purple—is it outside? Jamie looked out of the window, and the outside was dark. He fascinated and pulled back his sight. The nurses’ room was hung with cheap and durable fluorescent lamps. The lights were oysters white, everything under the lights would fade, no red light... Is it your own illusion? But the memory is very clear, under the golden brown hair is a pair of lilac purple eyes - now deep Prussian blue, bright and sharp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An iced awl passed through the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jami moved his feet, he hesitated, he instinctively felt that the prey he chose was not so good, but he did not want to give up easily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghoul’s memory of Sasha’s openness has such a paragraph—how can it pass the violent beast in the case of scarred, exhausted and unarmed group? It's very simple, as long as you are stronger than them, or behave better than them. Beasts are more timid than you think, and cherish their bodies and lives, especially when they have better and easier to deal with prey, they will never avoid it, they will find trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They will give you a way to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crab gray eyes and blue eyes look at each other for a while, crab gray eyes retreat, Jamie turned his head, Avery is too fat It doesn't quite suit his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Choose me!" At the entrance, the little girl who had been touched by Jamie’s face promptly called out, "I am better than him! Ivor It’s a liar, a bad boy, his class has never passed, he has also played! Mrs. Boro is allowed to join us because of sponsorship! He is not a good boy, never!”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avery rushed in the air, Jamie caught him: "This is not good," he said seriously: "I only need good children." He looked small Girl: "Are you a good boy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little girl is crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl around Sasha squirmed uncomfortably, her lips trembled and seemed to want to say something. Sasha stopped her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jami took the little girl with brown hair, Avery was left in the room, his nose was flowing, no one to help him . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time passed quickly, two hours passed, and the towering waves and squalls were removed, and the sea was empty, nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do it." Somitre ordered briefly. He has a lot of trouble. In his organization, there are only a handful of two or three people who can make a real heart. Other guys... they don’t care about directly hitting the whaling ship, throwing a burning bottle at the farm, or giving The lab sent bomb packages, and didn't mind giving those guys who made a fortune by cruelty to the animals, a direct face-to-face lesson – but they didn't dare to kill, even if there were clear orders, they didn't do it, they stood by. There are a few who are willing to do it, but the object cannot be a child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stupid coward! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They didn’t figure out at all—the ealf represented animals, the guardians of animals that were harmed, abandoned, and killed by humans. They stood in humans. The opposite, human beings are their enemies! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compassion for the enemy is a dangerous and ridiculous thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Children are future human beings. They need to eat, need to wear, and need to enjoy. Every child has to eat 50 tons of food from the fall to the end of the burial. Nearly 1 million liters of water, the newspapers and magazines that are read out are equal to 24 large trees, and consume 350 kilograms of tin (for car batteries and electronic equipment, etc.), 300 kilograms of zinc (used to make bronze, Steel component coating and rubber, dye industry) and more than 700 kg of copper (for the electronics industry, engines, wires, etc.). The consumption of aluminum is greater, with an average cost of about 1.5 tons per person per day, consumption of 12 tons of clay (used in the manufacture of bricks, paper, paint, glass and pottery); as well as salt, food industry, plastics industry, pharmaceutical industry Salt is also used in the transportation industry. According to calculations, an average of 13 tons of salt per person is required for life. In addition, more than 500 tons of building materials such as stone, sand and cement are needed in one person's life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of them are valuable resources that take a long time to regenerate and even disappear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they will multiply and give birth to more parasites. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earth is about to be hollowed out. Its aborigines, that is, those lovely animals, are being expelled and captive by human beings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Animals do not need humans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every ealf member is united for this great and bright goal, they should be more determined, more decisive, stronger, not critical The moment is timid and shrinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, he also has Jamie and several other companions who are more trustworthy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They set up a temporary mini-camera next to the trout pond. The sacrifice was brought over, the little girl found that the matter was not as wonderful as Jamie said, she began to cry, it doesn't matter, this is exactly what they need, the light is aimed at the little girl's tearful face, she The clothes were taken off, the light, the ropes tied to the hands and feet, and the two men standing on both sides with the ropes, feeling like a kite, so that she could pull her whole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s still Jamie, he’s probably the only one (and possibly Somitre) who is willing and able to squat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind is almost unstoppable, and the rain is getting more and more dense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have to hurry," one of the people who took the little girl screamed: "The rain will blur the lens. The declaration we can wait for another Edited."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jermi nodded. He put on a mask and raised a knife that described it as a knife. Can easily break the whale skin, they seized from a whaling ship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before he started, he read a prayer and gave it to his "mother" - a female Bernese mountain dog. This is the rule, he will recite a paragraph before each action. This is a declaration, look, this is for you, dear Mary! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jamie has no father, only a mother, but his mother does not like this ugly son. She lives very remotely and has no friends. She gave her a good chance. She locked her three-year-old son in the garden's tool room. When she thought of it, she threw some food and water inside, but more often she didn't remember, and saved Jamie's life. In the semi-wandering state of "Mary", she is not allowed by the owner, but she is free. She rummages through the garbage and then brings it back and shares it with Jamie. When she is pregnant with a puppy, Jamie also Can be divided into one of eight breasts/heads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People have to wait until four years later when Jamie’s mother discovers that there is still a child in the garage. They took Jamie and sent him to the Child Protection Reception Center, where he got a fairly good treatment. And taking care, "Mary" was sent to the stray animal shelter, and Jamie thought it could get the room, the bed, the food, the water and the sun just like herself, but actually, because Mary was old and bald, The second week after entering the shelter was electrocuted. Its body may have been sent to a food processing plant and turned into cat food or dog food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the beginning, Jamie didn't know this. He was looking forward to the reunion with "Mary." He worked hard and worked hard, hoping to buy a garden. The small house, so "Mary" can be safe and secure with him, live happily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His good hopes were shattered in a sunny afternoon, and his stray animal protection shelter began to “clean up” those unacceptable cats and dogs because of euthanasia The poison needles are too expensive. They wet the animals and then electrify them, or they are sent to the carbon monoxide furnace in batches, and the dog food factory's car stops at the back door of the shelter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jamie knows that he can no longer find the "missing" "Mary". Furious, he held the head of the person in charge of the shelter and pushed it into the carbon monoxide furnace. His colleague had to subdue him with a baton. He was prosecuted and injured. He stayed in prison for a year and a half. Parole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since then he has not been able to find a decent job, he has tried to help people take care of pets, but he will always be for those irresponsible masters The fire was violent, and they were forcibly taken away or used violence against their owners - he later entered the prison twice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he was in prison, the stray dogs and cats he adopted were taken away by the shelter. He was found after he was released from prison and sent a notice. But they didn't find it. They are not famous dogs. They are not beautiful. No one wants to take them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn’t understand why he is being subjected to such cruel punishment. Shouldn’t those people get some lessons? They forced them to wear shoes, clothes, collars, drag them, hit their buttocks and heads, not to eat, drink, lock them, or even cut them! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why can humans turn a blind eye to these crimes? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
