			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steel backstage hidden under the stage became very quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dancers, mechanical engineers, make-up artists, sound engineers, electrical engineers, stage installations, stage supervisors and general supervisors... all living things are caught In the silence of completeness, their vitality was taken away, and there was no loss. Only the machine was creaking, the sparks were flashing, the lights were bright, and the cola was smashing out of the broken bottle... Oh, no, can't say all, Anthony Hopkins is still alive, he is intact, but this is probably only temporary - the ghoul comes out of the hills piled up by the body, hanging on the cheekbones The blackened skin, he raised his face, carefully sniffed the smell of the air, a stream of biological turbulence flowing around him, the crisis has not passed, he said to himself, then the lights went out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steel sheet, which is as thick as a few inches thick, bends and breaks, as if it were hit by an invisible and huge electric bauxite machine, the backstage roof collapsed. The light and the undisturbed infrasound wave are put into the sealed room straight, the screen is broken, the precision modulation equipment is twisted with the recording and video equipment, and it is not willing to be torn into small pieces, the electric wire bursts, the current Crawling along the cola and metal panels in all directions, the body has not yet disappeared and is forced into a fine crimson residue - Anthony Hopkins raises his hands as if to resist and touch like a touch The air in front of me turned and walked away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door to the outside world is a bit distorted, but it is not very serious. The ghoul opened it with a little effort and he walked through a section. It was very bright, but now he couldn’t reach his fingers. His feet were soaked in the water. His nose smelled salty. It was sea water, and his ears heard a bang. From small to large, some of the passages were underwater. I don’t know where the cracks appeared. The outside water was poured in. Hopkins did not hesitate to go forward. The passage went up and waited for him to open. When the other door came out, he stood at the top of the theater. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The center of the theater, that is, the place where the Xiqiao originally stood, there was a deep hole in the black hole, and the cage made of vacuum wall was broken. Hundreds of thousands. It exploded, and the fragmented area occupied about two-thirds of the audience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stage is sinking, dragging the entire theater - the camera and lights on the boom are swaying rhythmically. Forty-nine thousand and thirty-two spectators are dying - people close to the stage, especially VIP seats, in order to stand (sit) away from the goddess of the heart, or away from the noisy ordinary audience, They have spent a real big price; today this expensive expense has not only failed to give them a little benefit in this disaster. Instead, they let them go to death faster. They died, their limbs were swollen, their internal organs were spit out, and their blood flow was not only the same as that of deep-sea fish that were forcibly dragged to the surface of Shanghai. The second- or third-class seats should be a little better - most of them are young people in their 20s and 30s, strong and powerful. Endurance is strong... Although the voice makes them dizzy, violent, and the body is like a cut pain... but they still have their own lives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this time will not be too long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final stage of Xiqiao was arranged in the center of Polyphemo, which was originally an island lake connected to the sea, inverted pyramid-shaped body The structure cost a total of 30,000 tons of high-quality steel and about one-half of the former lightweight metal. According to the agreement, it will be retained as a permanent open-air building after the concert. But now it seems unlikely, the invisible giant has twisted its spine, the huge branches are crumbling - the sound disappears, some people wake up, but the situation has not improved, they are constantly shaking Shaking, disintegrating seats, running between the ground and the roof, looking for a safer place, but unfortunately their efforts have nothing to do but to add more wounded and dead. - Some people who are stunned or unable to move down the seat and in the hallway are trampled, and the body that stays on the ramps and steps is pushed wildly, and the passage is crowded with audiences of blood and tears. They screamed loudly, pushed each other and wanted to leave this dangerous place as soon as possible, but almost all the roads were filled with deformed steel and concrete blocks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone wants to help others, but it’s too difficult. Under the stimulation of the second sound wave, almost no one can save their original vision, and the feet are vacillating. Anything you catch will be able to get out of its original position in the next second. Every step you take out may be caught in your ankle or knocked on your knees, almost every minute. A few things fell, sometimes a plastic chair rest, sometimes an aluminum boom. The worst thing is that the lights that are out of action due to short-circuit currents are big and heavy, and they jump like a ball. Jumping - the two cameras overlapped in one seat, one of them still working, and the bright lens is like a one-eyed sneer under the mapping of the work lights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins turned his head around, and the pale blond hair was noticeable even in dimly lit places, and the ghouls were as usual in the dark. The eyes of work quickly found their goals. Besib is by his side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha Hopkins saw him for more than a decade The biggest mandala flower ever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to ten feet of greenish, fertile leaves, trumpet-like white flowers, blocking the passage in front of the road, Besib caught the sand The hand, looking around, the VIP seats and the ordinary auditorium are separated by an open corridor platform with no width. They can of course climb up and bypass the green and shining things, but the trembling from the feet. With a huge and harsh squeak reminding them that time is tight, and the sparkling, unrelenting warm sea water has drowned their feet - the entire theater is sinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib pulled out the gun, and Sasha shook his head. "Wait a minute, I have a feeling..." He said: "It seems to be an 'old friend'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The mandala flower swayed fiercely, and a pair of bear-like hands opened the branches and leaves, and the leaves turned into a dry powder in an instant, and the man inside coughed up painfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib reveals a confused look. He just opened his mouth and wanted to ask, and he slammed him out louder than any previous one. ——The “inverted pyramid” has finally fallen down completely. It can be compared to the broken sound and percussion sound of one of the most difficult and horrible voices in the world. It is filled in everyone’s ear, in its empty stomach. The humans, which were attached to the passages and seats like parasites, were thrown up with countless pieces of metal and concrete. They stayed very short in the air and then were thrown away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baoer gasped, he was lucky, the twisted seat was stuck, and his half body was suspended in the air, light blue The eyes reflect the crystal light of the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His father, Foggs Douglas, was blocked by a piece of protective glass that had not yet been broken. He climbed up hard and carefully stepped on the original deficiencies. Above the metal baffle with his knees high, he stretched his hand and pulled his son. The treasure didn't move. The seat that descended from the sky and his companion wrapped him firmly. They looked like a grotesque pliers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This doesn't work," Boa said intermittently: "No, you have to find some tools."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Mr. Douglas hesitated a moment. He saw a broken rod that was not far away. He might take it to open the back of the chair. He squatted down, knees on the ground, and his hand extended toward it. A faint shudder came and it slipped a few centimeters. Mr. Douglas decided to work harder, but just as he was about to touch it, a gold-plated, high-heeled high heel stepped on his hand, and Mr. Douglas roared bitterly as he waved his other hand and tried to catch it. That high heel, Mrs. Douglas's movements are much faster than him. She is petite, and the narrow gap between Mr. Douglas and the glass fence is not a problem at all. The leather high heels are crisp and loud on the thin metal passage. The percussion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Douglas blushes, the sling falls into the water, he climbs up almost violently, turns around, shakes again and again The tilt forced him to swallow all the curses and swear words he could think of. He grabbed a seat back in time and didn't fall into the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
