			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smooth flight, pulling a straight line in the sky is a Shrike; a regular drawing of a wavy line is a finch, like a small feathered The parcel was thrown up and thrown down vertically and it was the Braun and the Skylark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At about 10 o'clock in the morning, the gardener at the lakeside villa will carry a large bucket of corn kernels while blowing the whistle and throwing it into the lake. The swans and wild ducks rushed on the surface of the water, flapping their wings and gliding low to eat the special meal that the humans gave them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exquisite building that the gardener serves is located on a grass that slopes into the water, white bricks and doors, brown a-shaped roof and windows, surrounded by Around the spacious veranda, the wall facing the lake is all glass, and there is a small and complete greenhouse behind it. The left wing stretches out and sets up a small dock. The dock is moored with a seemingly only girl's dream. The blue-tailed tail boat that appears in it floats on the clear waters of the water, like floating in the air, ready to carry its little owner to the clouds and stars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is beautiful, but it is similar to the world. There are no three or five groups of lakes, with children and tents, fishermen in dark green vests, around On the driveway of the lake, there is no bicycle wheel twisting the crazy flight. The deer in the woods walked leisurely and leisurely. They never worried that they would be broken by bullets or shot through the skull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People want to get here, you need to take the train from the city, the train station is twenty-five miles from here, and there is only one in the twenty-five miles. Cement roads for two cars in parallel, roads and jungles, grasslands and rivers on both sides of the road, each square foot is privately owned; this area has been extending southward, covering the hills around the lakes and lakes we have just seen. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Carson lives here with Chiz Carson, and the doctors and nurses of Chiz, who want fresh air, beautiful mountains and tranquility The lake surface can slightly alleviate the inevitable torture and depression during the withdrawal treatment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not accept relatives, refuse visitors, even if they just want to see poor Chiz Carson. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not everyone is malicious. Mrs. Carson knows, but she also knows that there are always one or two people, just like those who like to open. The flies that suck the pus and blood below - each of them has an innocent look, a question of ignorance, a sigh of sorrow, and a sigh that is fragile at the top of your heart, and the top is soft. Go, they don't do anything, as long as they can taste your pain, they will be happy for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doctor of Chiz Carson also liked this place very much. No poison pin seller could get close to the house to seduce his patient; the patient was just a little girl, and he suffered a major blow not long ago, but he could still be called Determined. The mind is clear; while her mother has been a bit over-corrected and nervous about her daughter, she can still support and understand his work; the scenery near the house is beautiful and the bed is comfortable. The cook's craft is also good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General withdrawal treatment takes only three months to six months. The treatment of Chiz Carson has been extended to more than a year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While waiting for afternoon tea, Mrs. Carson raised this question with no worries. The doctor thought about it and asked the cook to bring the afternoon tea a little earlier. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We must first know," he said, "how can the yin yin work?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "How does human happiness come about? - The feeling of 'happy' is actually just a reward mechanism for the evolutionary god to give to human survival and reproduction. You see. You eat, Drink water, make love - food is delicious, water is clean, temperature is right, you get the chance to nurture the next generation. Your brain tells you that these are very comfortable, it makes you feel satisfied, easy, safe, and motivate you to continue Do.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the brain, responsible for this task is the brain endocrine dopamine, which is the transmitter of neural information, usually living in the brain neuronal cells Once released, it will be combined with the receptors of the nervous system, and the receiver will sing them to the nerve cells. Then, dopamine sends a happy message to the nerve cells, giving the nerve cells a feeling of being generally happy to extremely happy. Produce 'happy' this Emotions.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the yin yin? The yin molecule is a real violent madness. Once it enters the human body, it will quickly invade the tour carrying dopamine. Take the cells," the doctor picked up the silver clip and placed the sandwich on the bottom of the three-layer silver plate. Use it to push the two-layered muffin. "They combine very powerfully and can easily occupy dopamine in the cells. Position, then where is the dopamine that was forced to go?" He re-cuffed the muffin and piled it on the third layer of cake and fruit tower: "It only combines with the receiver, the receiver I don't understand its hardships. It only follows the arrangement made by the brain to transport dopamine to nerve cells, and dopamine will only awaken its 'happy' factor in a step-by-step manner."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because of this, the intensity and speed of the shock brought by the yin molecule is far greater than the information conveyed by the nerves in the diet and sex, and the pleasure it brings is stronger than the two should be brought to people. The true happy behavior - the more pure and ingestible the cola, the greater the amount, the more kein yin molecules it carries, the more the migrating cells are occupied, the more dopamine is expelled, the more human The more 'happiness' that can feel hypocrisy, of course, this kind of happiness is not good for human beings, but it is difficult for you to overcome it, because it is only more ferocious than it. Luoyin and the virus, it is almost impossible to find something that can resist it in natural and healthy enjoyment, so after quitping the yin yin, the people who re-enter the white demon in the near future are just countless. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Miss Chiz Carson is a good boy who knows a lot. She is also reading books related to it. She often talks to her about her body. Situation," doctor Said, put the snacks back in place: "She seems to have got rid of the control of the yin yin, but she and I can't see anything that will make her happy, which is dangerous. Once she left here and returned to normal life, but without the constraints of the environment, without the control of drugs, she did not know whether she would take the initiative to go out of the dangerous first step - you know, outside, It would be a simple matter to get a pack of yin, bin poison, or sea luoyin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then say you have to continue to live in seclusion." The man said that his tone was not so obvious dissatisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For Chiz, dear," said Mrs. Carson: "We still need half a year, six months, and will soon pass, Chiz has Very hard, she has been looking for something that will make her happy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I continue to do this, I will only go to the yin yin to find happiness. The man stood up from the chair and held Mrs. Carson’s waist from behind, gently as if he was hugging a dream that could break at any time. His lips gently rubbed her neck and looked close to the artery. The skin that beats gently: "The doctor said it was right, baby, I need rewards, reward me, or I will not obey."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "No reward," Mrs. Carson said coldly: "Only punishment, if you are not obedient," she said with a playful voice: "I will use a feather duster to pump your ass."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
