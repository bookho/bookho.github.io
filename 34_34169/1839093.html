			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two beasts danced on the narrow trestle, one-on-one, the dagger that Mr. Hopkins hid in the boots disguised to the priest The Malay knives that make the cross, behind them are the flames and dark sky as the background, the bangs and snoring of the towers and trees burning, and the vague crying in the distance, all accompanied by this short dance. They were shaken by Catherine's body with the shadow of the light. Sasha was still unconscious, short of breath, and flushed on the cheeks. Catherine used her forehead and lips to test her body temperature, but found nothing abnormal... After a while She only understood that not everything was normal, but her body temperature could not be the standard of evaluation. She was as cool as Sasha and then the same heat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A helicopter flew over Catherine’s head and groaned, she held back and looked up, it was a big black helicopter . Maybe I want to land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine found himself sitting on a yellow circle and a white cross. It seems that this place can escape from the ravages of Vulcan. For reasons, Ariau probably only used a lot of steel and cement on the helipad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The helicopter hovered over their heads for a while and flew away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The members of the action group in the helicopter are very excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not every time you go hunting, you can return with full load. Sometimes the prey will rush to get rid of or kill the members of the intelligence team before they arrive. At that time, the analysis team made a wrong judgment. They only seized an empty bag (meaning those innocent people who were mistaken for criminals), and more of them appeared in the identification of the intelligence team members and the follow-up work. Mistakes and mistakes, so that the ducks that have been roasted, the spices and salt of the ducks patted their wings and flew away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good luck like today is rare, even without identification, they suddenly captured their goals with their own eyes - two objects! One of them is probably "ghoul", and the ten ** with his knife is "black ritual", their intelligence team member Catherine holding a little girl sitting near the two, it seems that the situation is not good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Close to the point, close to the point!" A team member put his or her eyes on the telescope tube, and then attach the other end of the lens barrel to the window glass. Top: "Lower it, lower it... Ah, hey, hey, what is it, the little girl with gold hair, I dare to swear, she has a pair of purple eyes." He said with joy: "Two dragons, A princess. We can do nothing, wait for one of them to kill another."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They seem to see us." Occupy another The guy in a window shouted, he seemed to see one of the targets glanced up, but he couldn't be sure which one, or two? The speed and movement of their movements are too fast, and human eyes cannot capture them accurately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you see it, there is more than one helicopter here." "The anesthesiologist" cried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no such thing as we do." One guy whispered, two other helicopters with the Ariawu logo are Around the fire tower, I tried to rescue the passengers and service personnel trapped at the top of the tower. Some people were beckoning to them, but no one responded to them. The driver even deliberately shut down the air talk system, which made him a little uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who said that we have nothing to do," said the "anaesthetist" with great enthusiasm: "We can fly over their heads, sift the nets, let me shoot a few shots, and then... we can go home." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you think the fishing net can fall?" Bud watched the hammock rolled up by the hot air: "Unless you are added." I think it would be nice if there were riot grenades used in elite national troops. This kind of grenade can produce poisonous gas that temporarily confuses and paralyzes muscles. If you can lose so many pieces... that is really great. Unfortunately, this kind of thing is too strict. Even if the "institution" can be regarded as semi-official, it is still impossible to get it, or it can be obtained, but it has not been known like them... Well, not very reliable. Guy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The helicopter pilot gave them a squint. A group of people who don’t have common sense, he thought, maybe the action movie is too much. The helicopter is so powerful that it is worn in flames and smoke. It looks really cool, but in fact no one. So dry, the turbulent airflow over the fire can make the handling of the helicopter extremely difficult (as it is now), the driver of the general technology can't cope; and if the hover over the fire is too long, the engine will inhale the smoke. Damaged or even crashed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The driver looked at the person in charge of the operation. His face was gloomy and his mouth closed. He seemed to have no interest in this discussion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The composition of the "institution" is not very close, especially in the action group. The team members may be unemployed, may also have a business, and there is no fixed cooperation specified by the organization. Personal happiness and the distance between the incidents, after all, many times, those slippery guys will not wait to be in the spot; the so-called head of the action group is only to see who has more experience, he is These people don't have much prestige, and they never expect to be able to control these unruly bastards—especially if the situation is quite favorable and the temptation is extraordinarily large. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A living "black ritual" has 50 million, and the "ghoul", his reward limit is only a few million at first, but due to some so-called The appearance of the "criminal collector", the bounty hanging on his name can be converted into platinum twice his weight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After completing this vote, the 6 people here can go home to support the old, no wind and rain, no fear, no injury or death, When I think of it, it is difficult for the head to say the words to cancel the action - he also needs money. His daughter studied in an expensive but value-for-money art school where his wife's liver and kidneys needed to be exchanged. Fathers and mothers needed a sunny, small house with a courtyard and garage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay." Finally he said: "Whatever you want to do, let us do it."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hop Hopkins and the priest did notice the helicopter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest’s response is slightly faster, and Dr. Hopkins is a little slower because the latter considered whether the helicopter would be related to Catherine. He observed that when the helicopter did not react to the people trapped in the flame, he let go of his heart. Even if the helicopter was indeed "institutional", it would not risk taking Catherine and Sasha first. They are not worth the money at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two savage beasts tacitly (although this would make both people disgusting, but it is true) retreat from each other’s arms and open each other the distance. The helicopter rummaged through their heads, as if only occasionally, it tilted slightly at the junction of the rainforest and the Amazon River, marking a semi-circular arc, disappearing behind the dark flora and burning towers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
