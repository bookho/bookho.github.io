			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not necessary," the voice on the bed repeated, and Jared was turning his head hard, his face faintly rosy, and in his eyes The light even surpassed the vibrant child: "Have a ha, I...have a ha...I am here, I don't need...others!" His voice is not high, he still has awkward Echo, but the room was so quiet that the sound sounded so loud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stefan went up and pulled the account away. This can be seen more clearly, a twisted copper tube ( There is a fuzzy pattern on the edge) from the left side of the shoulder blade of the old man, and the other end is not known under the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The right atrium is only five millimeters from the aorta, the upper side is the subclavian artery and the carotid artery, and the next three centimeters is the heart, as long as the damage to these vital parts... ...No one dares to pull out the copper tube according to the usual method, and the surgery can't, and he can't support it for a long time." Stefan gently touched the metal heated by blood and body temperature, it feels like quite Something is pleasant, Jared's murky eyes staring at him, if not now - not Stefan, this may be the only one that can save one's life... Hybrid! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, yes," said Stefan. "It’s your little friend. She is called Lila. Look," he pointed Dry breasts, the part of the chest tube inserted into the chest, whether it is muscle or skin, no tears and deformation, as if it grows out of the body, "The father thought she was one of the women who served him, although in theory she did Yes, her mother is the daughter of the saint, ranking fourteen. She is the granddaughter of the saint. Serving and pleasing the saint is her glory and responsibility - so she came in without attention, but waited for the saint to ask her to do something When things happen - you see it. This is a holy thing, it is said to be..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello..." Jared pleaded weakly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will save you, father." Stefan said: "Now is not the time to return to my feet." He bent down slightly and pinched With his father's hard, cold fingers, he pulled out his robes from his hand—with a clear malice, he paused for a while until Jared's whine from the depths of his throat completely plucked him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest held out one hand and held the father's chest, and the other hand held the copper tube. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without any warning, while pulling out the copper tube, the blood contaminated the skinny body of the old man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You will serve the Lord your God, and he will bless your food, and your water, and you will remove disease from among you." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stefan threw the copper tube on the ground. Lifting up your hands, there is nothing worth mentioning. But the dark things of the past were gone when he read the first word, and his expression was calm as never before. The eyes are clear and the sound is soft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bissib’s wheezing gradually calmed down,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha overslept, stunned Heyman, he found him shaking. His face is no longer so pale. But the situation of the whole person looks even worse - if Stefan’s power can affect Besib, of course, it can affect Heyman - he probably never knew so clearly between himself and Stefan. The gap, a big enough to make a crazy gap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hayman should have tried it at least once, otherwise he will never allow Stefan to snatch his "glory" and "responsibility", but Regrettably, he did not succeed. His failure angered his father, and from the time they entered the room until now, the time was not short. In addition to the beginning of "no need!", in the case of Saint Jerry, Hayman. Stronga does not exist at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He forgives all your sins and heals all your diseases."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, already It’s coming to an end, it’s a really unpleasant episode. Sasha no longer cares about Little Strange, who is about to become a pile of rubbish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stefan let go of the body, "How are you feeling? Father?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... Very good.” Jared Strangya gasped and replied, he tried to sit up from the bed, ecstatically stroking himself back to his original chest and taking a few deep breaths to make sure he had recovered. I started to unplug the tube from the roots, and a little blood flowed out, but he didn't care at all: "It's better than ever, haha."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Stefan."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jared stared at his son, his eyes gradually became harsh: "Hello."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stefan." Stefan does not Retreat said: "Father, look at the mirror."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A priest immediately walked over and opened the account in front of the mirror, the mirror was facing the bed Jared saw herself—a young man who was at least five years old. He hadn't seen his black hair for five years. He lifted his arm and his skin was no longer slack, and he found more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Going again," old man, yes, he is still an old man: "Come again." He eagerly shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishb gently moved his lips, his ability is essentially the same as his name, human greed can easily touch those deep in the soul and body Something inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can't," Stefan shook his head and saw enough of Jared's expression that he added: "Now can't. You will die, father."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a few seconds, Jared’s sight seemed to penetrate Stefan’s body, but he eventually I recovered my reason and didn't continue to ask: "So, Stefan..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I won't stay here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leave here, half of it belongs to you, and when I die, it belongs to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I can't stay here, just like I have to be called Stefan," said Stefan. "You can't compete with the country."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jie Rhett closed his mouth, with 1.96 billion, the number of Vatican subjects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition, there are still some things that I need to remind you." Stefan said: "The first is Hopkins, I have already said, I am not I hope they are bothered," he glanced at Hayman. "I can do a lot of things, but some of them still need the help of others, very important help. This time I arrived very well, father, but I can't guarantee every It’s very timely.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jared also glanced at him, but he looked at Sasha: "No one will bother them anymore, unless it is necessary."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will bring Take them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And Lila."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a moment when Sasha thought that Jared would jump up and rush to death Stefan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerried did not, he bowed his head. It seems to be thinking: "Why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know who Lila's father is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Dirty blood."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dirty or clean is not important, what matters is her two uncles, their brothers are dead. I don’t think they will be happy to hear Lila’s death.” Stefan said: “Although you call all the abilities other than yourself to be called 'heresis' and 'devil', the power of them is not It will disappear because of a title."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When can I get it again?" Jared said, this sounds a bit strange. But the people present can understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two years, or three years," said Stefan: "You will live a hundred years old, father."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The night is over." Stefan said: "Now is the darkest time." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe because I want to let Jared personally make a judgment. They didn't kill Lila directly, but that doesn't mean that Strang Jacobs won't use torture instruments - Stefan used her power on her and her body was cured. But the spirit of the crash is not so quick to fight back: "She wants to kill Jared Strang Jacob."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because her mother is It was burned to death by Jared Strange, because she not only fled, but also married a pagan outside and gave birth to a child. I don’t know how Jared deceived her. But she came back. With the children, Jared took them as bait and killed their husband and father. Your 'head' is the unlucky brother." The mountain wind violently tears Stefan's gray hair. And his voice: "Every man named Strang Jacob has eaten his flesh. Jared did not kill Lila, he wants to raise her, and then as a public 娼妓. Fortunately Lila has Ability - she escaped."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even if the most inferior excrement in hell is in front of Jared Stranger, you have to go down the drain," said Stefan. "But unfortunately, he can't die now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because of the supervision sect." Sasha concluded: "The rights are really fascinating."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For me. Rights It’s just a tool to achieve the goal.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha turned his eyes to the dark valley, and they are now standing on the top of the hill where Stronge’s mansion is located, here Probably the highest place in Baiyan City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The devil took Jesus to the highest mountain, and showed the world, the glory of the nations, to him, and said to him. If you fall down Come to me, I will give it all to you." Sasha said: "Stefan, you took me to see this, and want to say something to me?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because that is also a father, and he happens to have a son?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bissib snorted loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes," Stefan said without saying: "Being the son of the devil is itself one of the most profound sins - even me. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Without Jared. Strong, your sins are equally deep, 'Father,'" Sasha pointed to his own eyes. Then there is the hair: "I don't want to ask questions, because I know very well, I don't have the right to take stones to marry you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your sin is not from yourself ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 'I can't let my eyes sleep, and I can't let my eyes fight.'" Sasha said quietly, "I know where I am going." What is it, I know what the future residence is like.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I always want to be with my father.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Note in this article: Because the conversation between Stefan and Sasha is more concealed in this chapter, so explain it here - Stefan, that is, Hazel. Stronge is Jay. Rui His son, Heyman is his younger brother, but Stefan was driven away by unwarranted charges because he needed to reduce the male members of the family when he was a big child. So he hated Stranger. Each and his father, the saint Jared. And he came back with two main lines, the first is to try to gather and renovate the entire supervising sect for the country and the Vatican, and secondly for the Messiah, that is, Sasha Hopkin Si, he indulged Lila and even Heyman, one is to retaliate and to marry the sage Jared, and the other is in his cognition, Hayman blindly respects and trusts, loves and the latter The use of the former is very similar for Sasha and Anthony Hopkins, similar to the inside and outside of a mirror - one he wants Sasha to understand from the things he sees himself - - He didn't think that he could get Sasha completely out of Hopkins, but at least he could throw a dust or open a gap.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
