			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishb hit the sandbag, Sasha looked at his chin next to him, about half an hour later, Besib couldn’t help but stop the action: "Hopkin Don't tell me, you suddenly found out that you have fallen in love with me today."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just watched," Sasha said with a smile: "Don't So oh."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What observations have you observed?" Besib grabbed the towel on the back of the chair and wiped his head, neck and The chest, then folded it very carefully and put it in the dirty clothes. Since the beer incident, their things are no longer handed over to Avery, and the dinner has not been his part. He was taken away by West. Bu and Sasha are excluded. This feeling can be uncomfortable. Human beings are social animals. They are always eager to communicate. The strange thing is that this little guy still insists on not moving out. But this is useless, as Sasha Hopkins said, they are cowards, Besib is planning, trying to get Avery away from them - Boa and Ossien's things let The Carson family owes them a big favor. Kane Carson wisely handed over a well-developed investment company, but that was for Chegal, and he and Sasha took a two-day vacation. Can you do anything outside, or the person who successfully entered the Cardson family of the Grande School Board in this personnel change? Beppe is a smart and capable little ghost. If he can replace Avery's position, they can save a lot of heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are taller, Sasha said in his heart, he does not want to admit that he is a bit embarrassed, his body is inherited from Anthony Hopkins (although Kaiser Lin is not a very strong type. It looks a bit slender. He likes Besib better. Since he entered the football team, he has moved further toward the wild bulls and feels him every day. The weight and height are increasing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is your position determined?" Sasha asked, changing from sitting to lying on his back and picking up a book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All running back." Besib said in the bathroom. The water is screaming: "I like this position."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Running is the sharpest spear in front of the battle. He wears his strong body. Through the defense line of the other side - there are countless opportunities for sensible and legitimate people to fly, and Besib will certainly like it. He is like a Titan giant who can draw endless power from the mother of the earth. He seems to never be tired. Not afraid of injury and pain, and never mind and fear of your actions will hurt others - as long as that person dares to stand in front of him. The coach of the football team loved this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is your swimming team qualification?" The official qualification of Sasha Hopkins is also one of Grande's compensation. The position of Besib is also the same. There are forty-five players in the football team. There are only eleven who can play. Those who have just qualified for the team have to sit on the cold bench for nearly half a year. The possibility of being a regular player like Besib can be very small. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This has to wait for the new coach to come." Sasha said: "I will enter the gift class next semester - this matter has already been fixed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib went out and was covered. There is only one bath towel around the waist. "That means you can mention the university in the morning?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not yet." Sasha said: "Good university If you don't apply well, they will not only look at your credits, but also your extracurricular grades. It will take time to accumulate. But it is true that there is a shortcut. Also, you are white."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because I have to be armed for three hours every day, the coach has promised me," Besib pushed the foot of Sasha with his knee and motioned to let him open: "As long as this school league Grande can enter the top five, my extracurricular grades will be a." He squeezed Sasha to lie down on the sofa. The skin of Sasha is cool, and it feels very comfortable to touch it in such a hot weather. "Grand's swimming team will also participate in the competition, you should be able to get a good result - let the Boa. Douglas go to hell." He moved his shoulders. Thoughtful: "I really didn't know about the two things?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The two things - I'm not sure if he knows." Sasha said: "But the messenger is indeed Ossian Douglas, an ambitious fellow. He is not very friendly with his brother. When he discovers our true origins and identity, he wants to play with a knife and kill. Tricks - everyone knows that 'Tang' on the island of Poseidon is a must-have (Bessib has made a face). His only child died in Boa. Under the hands of Douglas, he would never be willing to give up - and Buddha Gus Douglas, the father of Boa, is also a self-contained, stubborn and violent 'stupid'. Of course, this is Ossian’s wishful thinking. There is not only one smart person in the world.”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He uses those 'integrated tea bags' to control the students?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are teachers," Sasha put the book on On the face: "It doesn't matter, the school board has started cleaning. As for those & Nbsp;; & nbsp; & nbsp package ...... "<br <br /> & nbsp />;"What's wrong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing." Boa has the same ability to control plants as his uncle, but it is very weak, and it is secretly strengthened by Shasha. In order to suppress Ossien that night, but now he can also extract the essence of coca's reality through the power extraction like Ossien? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey?!" Besib pinched the foot of Sasha, and Sasha kicked him, very awkward, and Bessib exclaimed exaggeratedly. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Boa's abilities...what did you do to him the same thing as I did then?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"...No," Sasha took the book on his face. "Just strengthen. What's the problem?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just want to ask "Bishb raised his arm and put it behind his head. "Can my abilities continue to develop?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sashal looked at him with astonishment he. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Just suddenly thought of a lot of things," Besib said seriously: "Sasha, we have to be stronger, not only to protect ourselves, but also There are..." He vaguely left the words in his mouth: "We have to have strength to decide our own destiny - Sasha, not just a good university, we still need a lot of things..." The colored eyes are shining: "Sasha, I finally understand why Chegale sent us here - this is his real purpose, we are better than other children, we have things they don't have. We are smarter than them, we are stronger than them, we have the power they don't have, Sasha, and even our life will exceed them - our achievements will reach a height they can't reach!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, like the president." Sasha said: "Your coach said this. You will become the youngest president of the Western Continent, when you are under age - As long as you can make four touchdowns!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!" Bessib called: "You are laughing at me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I laugh because I feel Self is too stupid," Sasha said softly. "You are right, Besib, we were originally different."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
