Go, he screamed dissatisfiedly. It is estimated that his short-legged German hound is the wife of the Welsh Lardog. These two dogs belong to different owners, and their temper and personality are also obviously different. But the hobby of climbing to the owner's bed is very similar. It is not sleeping on the feet or sleeping on the chest, which makes him mistakenly think that he is being crushed by the devil. For this reason, the baker has repeatedly made serious verbal warnings and gave one or two high-quality penalties, but the two dogs are still continually jumping into the bed, squeezing in the goose down and the human body emitting the hot and humid gas. among. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can he do besides tolerance? His short-legged little dog is smart and cute. It has been with him for more than ten years. When he was kicked by the school’s teacher, he was whipped by his bad-tempered father, and he was crying because he lost his love. This dog is always sitting next to him, sticking his tongue out of his hair and face. It is more loyal than any friend, and never looks like a stupid thing it looks like. The trumpet said, or used it as an effective weapon in the quarrel - as for the Welsh Lara, it was bought by a baker whose wife had been dead for several years. It took them a year to save, and it is said that they can find hundreds of pounds of truffles in a winter - although it has so far found only two or three mice that have been frozen in tree holes for winter and dogs that have been buried in snow. Oh, but always found something, isn't it? Anyway, this is a 5,000-dollar dog, and maybe it will one day be awesome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tongue continues to groan, the baker closes his eyes, he almost woke up, he wondered what his dog wanted to do, did he sleep unfortunately today? After a while, I forgot to prepare breakfast and walk for the dog, but if so, he should be able to hear their eager and crisp screams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The baker opened his eyes, the silver-blue skylight projected through the open window, and there was a dog on his chest, but not his The dog, his wife and his wife are not so beautiful, their bloodlines are impure, and to be precise, it is the kind of ugly mixed-breed dog that can’t be used as a topic when walking or sitting in a pub, and standing on him. The dog is very small, and the hair on the face, throat, feet and lower part of the tail has been carefully trimmed. The rich white curls are like the lady's cloak covering its head, shoulders and the entire upper body, slender feet. The part is clearly visible, and the tail that has been modified into a pompon shape is placed rigidly behind it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It bowed its head and tentatively sniffed on the man’s nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Isn't this a circus dog? The baker thinks. Then his breathing stopped. He remembered the recipes of these dogs for nearly two days. As one of the few male men in the town, those who were responsible for packing the remaining pieces of the broken meat of the tiger and throwing them into the dog group were One of them, a kind of nausea with a creepy sensation from his stomach to the nasal cavity, staying in the cold nose of the puppy and his close contact, he thought he wanted to vomit, but before that, a strong pain He shouted loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dog bit his nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The baker jumped out of the soft bed, like an acrobat who was playing a trampoline. His hand was raised in the air, trying to reach out to catch the daring animal, but his hand was just off the cover of the blanket. The sudden weight made his arms hang down, and the two crouching puppies jumped up in the darkness. Their teeth penetrated the globular muscles of the base of his thumb and the skin of the back of the hand. As if he had been biting in the air and spinning in the air under the command of the animal trainer, hanging on the thick and powerful hands - humans made a curse and jumped in the new pain and blurred vision. The bed, he endured the pain, waved his hands, trying to kill the two dogs in the closet or wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The puppies opened their mouths in time and jumped away. They are spinning at his feet. This is a subtle skill that can be achieved after long-term training. In the past performances, they can be two, three, four in a row... Wear them between the feet, neither will they collide with each other, nor will they let their petite body trip over their masters - of course, they can do the opposite, and the animal trainer often uses this trick. Teasing other members, including the Hercules, can't be spared. The baker fell, and the dog who was responsible for tripping his dog made a few rolls on the carpet. He jumped up lightly and shook his hair if nothing had happened. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The baker’s head hit the foot of the cupboard, he was dizzy, he wanted to stand up, but he couldn’t even find his finger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poodle biting his nose has been hanging there, now it’s working hard, the baker's nose is bitten with the whole nose, it’s very The big piece of meat, when it was busy chewing, the other poodle jumped up, its small claws stepped into the mouth of the baker's Zhang Da, the mouth instinctively closed, clenched, the scream of the puppy screaming, Its other claws, still in freedom, smashed around the baker's eyelids, and the pain of impatience caused the baker to open his mouth, and the injured dog limped away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get up, get up, the baker says to himself and escapes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood rushed out of his eyes and nose, contaminating the entire face, not realizing that the other two puppies were bypassing his arm and On the shoulders, they wraped around behind his head, grabbed his hair, stood firm with his ears, and inserted the long, long kisses into them, much like a bloody eyelid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jess heard a lot of water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a fountain in the garden that he has always been proud of. It turned out to be a dead pond with nothing but weeds and moss. After he bought the house, he dredged the water inlet and outlet, built the pool wall and the bottom of the pool with bricks of various colors, and stocked the goldfish. Rose. After the town and the "institution" reached an agreement, he expanded the pool with the interest-free loan provided by the latter, replacing the variegated brick with the new black pearl granite from Brazil, and the goldfish was replaced by the expensive Japanese koi. There are remote control lights at the bottom of the pool. There are three variations. The water jets from the spout can dance or dance with any music they like. He also got a few hundred miles away from the "Li Bai Qiao" in the ancient mine cave of the Kakucho Mountain in the northern part of the Sparacho Mountain - a rare and precious, once used in Rome St. Peter Square The church and the marble-based Madonna of the Palace of Caserbo, the real female, is as tall as a woman, with a compassionate face and a dignified form – she is placed on the side of the pool, lifelike, with grass and grass at her feet, a glance Going up, it’s like being a real person standing there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His heart lifted up, jerked out of bed, pushed open the window and looked down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God, a small elephant is standing by the pool. His stupid body is a two-folded marble Madonna. Obviously she hinders it from drinking and playing or dining. Under the clean sky, Japan The scales of the Koi are shining between the nose and mouth of the elephant, and it is catching fish from 500 to 1,000 yuan for the evening meal! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The damn devil!" James yelled, and he rushed out of the bedroom, leaving his wife to let him put on his shoes and screaming behind him, but In a few seconds, I rushed downstairs, took out the key behind the fireplace, opened my own wine cellar, and hung a US-made melee attacking shotgun on the wall without the barrel. There are thirteen bullets in the gun, and every other one is equipped with twenty steel balls, and one is loaded with eight pieces of gram of flying steel spears. These steel spears, like the nails used by plasterers, can shoot people out of their bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jems hopes that it will also be able to shred the image. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He kicked the door open and rushed out with a gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elephant is having fun, the sudden loud noise and the human curse have surprised it, its nose is still pointing in the air, the crystal water is flowing The stucco-like wrinkles flow down, and the tail of a koi squats under the white teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus pulled the trigger. One of the eight steel spears shot on the body of the elephant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cub screamed, and it swayed over to James, but forgot that his feet were a fountain, it fell in, splashed A big splash of water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jems cautiously held the gun close, the elephant swayed in the shallow water, and every time he struggled, the steel spear was deeper, he I can see that the pool water is getting deeper and deeper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little elephant looked at him, and the big red eyes shed tears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jems smiled at it, revealing eight white teeth, and he lifted the gun again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A huge force slammed into it, and James looked at his beloved gun and flew to the sky, while at the same time his own Arm, his fingers are also fastened to the trigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A nose with an adult waist thickness is elegant from the air and falls at a speed that is too fast, and it sweeps away the human arm and the danger. "Things", and quickly turned back, entangled Jim's waist, throwing him high into the sky, and then slamming down, James's head and the head of the Marble Madonna collided together A heavy, heavy foot like a disc is stepping on. The hardest bones and delicate marble of human beings even smashed in a minute without being crushed by fine wheat flour after three screenings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing in the bedroom window on the second floor, witnessing all this Mrs. James fell to the ground, she couldn’t make a sound, her feet were soft, and her yellow urine Sliding down the thighs, soiled the hem of the nightgown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little elephant screamed, nearly three times as big as it was adulterously wiping his body with his nose and began to help it stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. James climbed over the phone, and she tried several times before she called the sheriff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she trembled and pressed the microphone against her lips, a thick elephant trunk was quietly passing through the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
