Shawn said: "But he has been forced to the edge of the cliff, even if it is the grass, he will catch - Not to mention that the grass looks quite solid and reliable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "One million." Ivan said that the bookkeeper repeated his words aloud, Ivan waved, and the waiter around him took the remaining fried fish and an unmoved vodka. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All," Hopkins said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some gamblers who were ready to go because the gambling became uninteresting returned to their original position after a moment of hesitation, Catherine, Sasha and Besib still Standing in the forefront, Catherine was uneasy and moved. As a woman who had been subjected to male violence, she was very sensitive to the distance between people. The person behind her was too close to her, and she could not only be close. Smell the smell of perfume on his body, and he could feel his heavy breath - a subtle, hot wind sweeping through her back neck, and Catherine put down the elbow on the right in an unobtrusive manner. The right hand hangs on the side of the thigh, and the finger bends backwards, almost touching the trouser leg of the person behind her - she swears that if the idiot behind her is really close to the distance between them, for example, can make her finger directly Touching the extent of his body, she will let the unknowingly unknowingly feel the wonderful taste of being pierced by nails (toenails) by countless fine needles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the guy behind her is still polite, maybe he also found that his position is really embarrassing, he moved slightly to the left rear, Not much, but at least much better than before, Catherine glanced at the back of her shoulder with the corner of her eye - it was a big man, Catherine's shoulder only reached his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just when she was slightly distracted. The bookkeeper raised his hand and announced the beginning of a new gambling game. Catherine’s attention was pulled back, and she looked with concern at Hopkins’s bet, milky and gold chips, and dark green notes, all of which were large denominations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best place for Baccarat may be that its win or loss can be decided in a short period of time, and the bookkeeper opens the card of Ivan:" The dealer’s seven o'clock, “opened the brand of Hopkins again: “There is five points next to the house. The dealer wins.” He used the small wooden pole that was described as a “whip” in the casino whisper from the Hopkins bet pile. Pulled away two million. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next gamble, Dr. Hopkins, who was called a "silver-haired gentleman" in people's whispers, had a bad luck, and the god of doom took the lucky god and sat next to him. He always wins when the bookmaker sets a small bet, but loses when the dealer sets a big bet. The 10 million million bet sounds a lot. But if you want it to disappear, it is only a matter of the three or four bureaus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you still want to continue?" Ivan asked coldly, sulkingly licking the neck of his female partner, just like licking one Only the kitten, the chips and the cash piled up in front of him into a hill. "Your betbook is so worrying."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins’s chips are less than 100,000, and even Baccarat, which has a minimum bet, is not enough. He lifted his hand and the gambling manager came over. He carried a beautiful flat silver plate with a pen and a stack of bills. After recovering the bill. He brought back a whole small box of chips and a small box of cash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s amazing," Ivan said, licking his lips. There is no concealment of his greed, his tongue is fat and thick, and his tongue is covered with red and purple tongue. "You have to do a big job. Right? Sir?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," Hopkins said, crossing his fingers. A small box with chips and cash is placed on the elbow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivan changed to the neck of another female companion, his hand is not small. The dark-haired girl was too thin, and the head that could almost be covered by Ivan couldn’t help but dangle with his strength. She stared at the green-flavored table, with no expression, as if she could see from it. Mushrooms or something else that deserves her interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, as you wish," Ivan said: "This bet is all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The 3rd Baccarat table suddenly calmed down, and in contrast to the other Baccarat tables or the blackjack table, the roar of the roulette table is in stark contrast (although the latter voice Not too big.) The bookkeeper looked at the supervisor and the supervisor nodded, so the two bookkeepers began to count Ivan’s bet. Their actions were so fast that after a few minutes, one of the bookkeepers announced that Ivan’s existing bet was 67 million (less than 100,000). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about you?" The bookkeeper asked, he determined that the chips and cash in those two small boxes had exceeded 70 million. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Follow up." Dr. Hopkins said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bookkeeper announced the news to the entire casino in an unprecedented loud voice. This is the usual practice of the casino, like a "lucky kid", a bet Amazing gambling is also a good thing to attract gamblers and attract people's attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the gambler in "Tianqiu", there are a lot of people who lost hundreds of millions of yuan in one day or one night, but they bet five or six in one game. There are very few people in the millions - people are gathering with great enthusiasm, some people privately set a bet, bet the North wins or the new guy wins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last deck of cards left in the dealer, the bookkeeper sent a card to the dealer and the next house, and Hopkins had to make a card. Ivan will be there later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine held her breath, she never thought of seeing such a big gamble - the stakes piled on the table can almost buy two The sinners who were among the top 20 in the "institutional" reward list, Sasha and Besib were close, and the two boys hooked each other's little fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivan turned his own card first, and the make-up was Zhang Ba. The female partner around him was nervous, and Ivan opened his mouth and turned it over. The remaining two cards - two q, the Queen of the Queen and the back of the black peach queen are looking at the white satin shades on the table: "It's your turn, sir." He opened his nostrils, snoring Jetting, the tongue is pulled out of the teeth, like a wolf smelling flesh and blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins opened his own card, the outs was five, he opened the first card, is a three, the next one What will it be? If it is not a, then Hopkins lost, even if it is a flower card or a ten-three Bakala table, the rule is that the bookmaker wins when the bookmaker and the next house have the same points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last card opened, plum a. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The dealer is eight o'clock," the bookkeeper said in a plain but clearly recognizable voice: "The next nine points, the next family wins." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The onlookers screamed with excitement and others cursed, and those who put their bets on Ivan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivanka was in the seat, motionless, he was silent for a few seconds, as if to accumulate power for the upcoming storm - when he stood up Supervisors and bookkeepers also stood up, and Hopkins also saw two guards squeezing in from the crowd. But he didn't think that people were so loud and noisy, not even whispering like when he lost 10 million in the past. He just leaned his hands on the table and leaned forward. Look at the three cards that are spread out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It shouldn't be like this," he said, raising one hand and preventing the bookkeeper from taking the chips from him: "I want to appeal," he said, sitting back in his chair: "I suspect someone cheated."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the "Tianqiu" casino, gamblers often buy "stock rights", and the resulting conflict between gamblers and gamblers is of course inevitable. When questioning the outcome of a gambling game, as long as the bet exceeds a certain amount, the casino will basically assist, check or clarify - there are guards on the high platforms on both sides of the table, and there are supervisors on each table, he supervises The bookkeeper also supervises the gambler. The casino is full of monitoring probes, right next to the lounge. There are two sets of highly advanced and discreet instruments. The suspected gamblers don’t have to take off their clothes and don’t have to be tied. It takes only a few minutes to prove that you are innocent – ​​you can choose not to accept any checks, but in that case, you can only take your own bet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ivan’s complaint was accepted, and the guards and waiters began to distract the crowd at the table, the banker and the house, and the bookkeeper and supervisor. In short, people sitting at the table at the time were temporarily unable to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine turned her head and wanted to tell Sasha about the current situation. When moving the body, the same hard things resisted her back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't move." The man behind her said: "Otherwise, your best result is to spend the rest of the 50 years in bed."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha and Besib have encountered the same problems as her. Small pistols can be easily hidden in the sleeves of the jacket and even in the wide palms, under the control of the casino guards. Other gamblers simply couldn’t detect what was going on here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You won," Ivan said with satisfaction. "But our gamble can go on."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took an old-fashioned revolver from his jacket pocket, six-inch, and the surface of the gun body was treated with imitation lacquer, smooth and bright like a mirror, brown walnut handle with finger groove, pattern very beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I prefer this gambling," Ivan said. "I like it more than Baccarat." He used his right index finger to point the wheel, the runner. The gun body was popped up, and the inside of the bullet slot was empty. Ivan took a yellow bullet from his pocket and stuffed it into the bullet slot: "We need six people, fair," he turned the wheel, "I am here. There are already three people," he pointed to the two female companions around him: "Dear Sir, now you need to choose, the three people you bring - which two to choose?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
