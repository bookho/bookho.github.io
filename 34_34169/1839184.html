			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, Chegal really loves his son, even I can say that he used to love Meyare." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins said: "What makes this emotion reverse to another completely opposite direction? My dear son is the nature of mankind..." The child is a contradiction. He (she) is both a continuation of his life and a competitive enemy. Almost every parent is like this. When they see their blood continues, they will be filled with joy. And comfort, but when they grow up, they produce inevitable envy and hatred. The youthful and energetic daughter often makes the mother taste the neglect and coldness, and a strong and sensitive son will directly threaten To the status of the father... The latter’s hatred is completely normal and justified – but they must and must reproduce the offspring, because the other impulses that are deeply rooted in the human body, and they also need to prove – Dozens after death For centuries, the descendants of their children and their children will be the best example of his existence.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;??, this is why humans are tirelessly One of the reasons for seeking longevity. But this is another topic that we will not discuss today.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ancient Roman father is the happiest, twelve copper watches Under the law, the father’s rights have been the most and most clearly identified. The original meaning of the word “familia” in Latin is a bunch of slaves – as a parent, the father has the right to dispose of any family member, just as he can dispose of any one at will. A family property, undoubtedly, a son or daughter has a higher status and treatment than a slave, but in essence, the two are not much different, a father can kill his son (daughter) with impunity as A slave is dead (although not every father will do this), and their strength and majesty are so great that every member of the family is frightened and frightened. Nothing is nothing.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;This right Wei is really refreshing, but unfortunately, it also produces love and affection, especially the indifference and hatred between father and son.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The god of the sky, Uranus It is strictly forbidden for his wife Gaia to give birth to a child. Cronus casts his father with a scythe and kills him. Uranus cursed his son before he died. He will repeat his mistakes - Cronus fears He swallowed every child born to his wife until Zeus, the youngest son who was hidden, dethroned him with his brother, and in the subsequent war he seized him into the hell of Tartarus, but the same Zeus was also predicted to be killed by another, more powerful son, like a projection of the gods in the world, and more than one Roman emperor was killed by his sons... Caesar, who is more than a great meritorious deed, of course, is the emperor’s exile and killing his son, but this is obviously not worth recording, because in the Roman mind, this is in accordance with law, norms and morality. Like no one In the intention of Tiberius to give Caligula a glass of poisoned wine, even if the latter is not only his adopted son, but also his grandson - this situation did not improve until 52 BC, stipulates that all parents or sons Those who accelerate the death, or accelerate the death of other relatives, are subject to special punishment; by the year 212, Emperor Caracalla announced that the citizen law only applies to Roman citizens, and that citizenship gives all free people in the empire, that is to say Status, relationships and ethnic groups no longer have strong chips. The growing geographical area of ​​the Romans, the connection with the outside world and economic activities, as well as the rise of Christianity, all broke the foundation of the original family system. The status of blood relatives gradually replaced the clan. In the late imperial era, the inheritance system became more and more Based on the bloodline, various related laws have also produced a clear bias. The son and daughter have received further attention and cherish. Although the father still has the authority to say that, but fortunately they have no need to worry about their own at least. life safety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a pity that this does not mean that the cruelty and ruthlessness of the patriarchy has been completely curbed. They have changed a way to appear, or put on a layer of sacred coats instead of the fog of emotions - King Owen of Sweden He has sacrificed nine sons so that he will occupy the throne for a long time. The Semites also had the tradition of offering sacrifices to their sons. In the middle, Abraham had intended to sacrifice his son Isaac to God. Their successor, Ivan IV, used his cane to kill his son in a violent dispute. This example was later interpreted by a later generation as a tragedy caused by mental illness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fathers who do not have the above-mentioned noble status and grandiose reasons are attacking their descendants in the name of God, using firewood, or a whip or a fire stick. Either something else is at hand. The more a father is cruel, the easier it is to arouse the child, especially the son's reverse. He is afraid of the violence of the elderly, but he also envy and longs for this power. He always looks forward to his father. As soon as possible, aging or even death, so that he can seize his authority and wealth early. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in modern times, most fathers are still reluctant to let go of this long-standing fatherly authority, and try to reverse, interfere, or simply raise objections. My father will still be hated by his son... When I was working at the Mayo Clinic and Medical Center, I saw more than once that the joy of regaining my freedom due to my father’s death vaguely overwhelmed the grief from blood and affection. On the contrary, when the son dies, the mother's pain must be greater than the father. It can even be said that many fathers will consider other children when they determine that their son's condition cannot be recovered, even if they do not exist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This statement may cause many people to feel uneasy and doubtful. In fact, the curse of Oedipus is always entangled in the human soul, boy sex The first object of impulsiveness is often the mother. The first object of hatred violence is likely to be the father. The father and son are almost born enemies, although they are threatened by morality and law, or compromised with blood and long-term relationship. The emotions brewed by the father--the father will suppress the hatred, the son converges on the ambition, and wraps the real poison with the false pulse, and slowly and concealed the sinful spikes in a long time. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the absence of peace. "Sasha added.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the case of peace," Dr. Hopkins nodded: "If necessary," he opened. In the palm of your hand, softly said: "They will kill each other, although they may indeed love each other deeply. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you say this, there are many things that can be explained - for example, how does Meyare know the true identity of Besib? Given that all the insiders have concealed this secret for ten years - Chekale is not young, but still strong and powerful, as an abilities, he may be able to live for another 50 years, Mayaray Already in his thirties, he is young and active. As a future "Tang", he is very qualified in any aspect. He is always in awe of Chegal, even if the current "Tang" may be murder. The man of his father and mother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the monitoring of countless pairs of eyes, Chegal can't ruin this outstanding heir without any reason, and the eccentric laws and ethics of Poseidon does not allow him to do this. Do - the accidents of the previous generation can never be extended to the next generation, the order to scribble the roots can not be used on blood relatives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He released the news, and sure enough, Meyare was as self-righteous as a frightened eDonkey, he first sold Chekale To the "institution", a wonderful edge ball, even Chekal had to make a gesture of approval - he announced that he would not pursue this. Yes, Meyare did not deal with any of the people. The nominally semi-official “institutions” are more similar to a acquiescence of mercenary organizations – people on Poseidon Island often deal with such characters, sometimes employed, sometimes hired, and not surprising at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Celegal stayed in the "Institutional" special hospital "Babel" for half a year, and must admit that if there is no Hopkins father and son, The date he came out may be delayed a lot, and even worse, he will never come out. So he didn't lie, Hopkins was indeed his savior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He returned to Poseidon Island, so the top is not happy, Meyare, although he did not leave the handle on the face, but since he has opened his mouth If you don't bite, then you are exposed to your most deadly weakness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changalle arranged Sasha to Besib, which is almost a warning sign. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mey Reid is up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the middle of Chekal’s heart, and in order to be foolproof, he also throws another big bait in time. He is the one who loves Besib, far more than that given to Meyare. But this love is obviously not enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha does not think that the current Besib can find this, but there is always one day, he will understand what happened this night. At that time, he must have been strong enough to mature, and Chegar, even as an actor, is too old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, everything is so obvious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So," Sasha asked: "Can Bessib still survive?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "If he is stupid," Hopkins replied: "I want to, but I can't guarantee that it will last too long. And in fact he is a smart boy, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha thought for a moment: "I will make him stupid."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition," he went on Said: "We are not like that, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......The eyes of Dr. Hopkins shine in the darkness: "Of course," he solemnly The thing said: "Sasha, we are not like that."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Hopkins is more than just a father, just like Sasha is not just a son. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins once again observed Sasha in detail - he can see many people in Sasha, his, Catherine, he Father's, his mother's, Catherine's parents, the most is still Sasha's - his dearest little sister Sasha, the purple eyes, the white little teeth, the blond hair and the rose lips, though As the age grows, the bulging cheeks and chin gradually disappear, and the contours of the facial features are sharper, sharper, and the legs and legs become slender... Then, he will become a low voice, tall, and long on the chin. Beard - but this does not affect Hopkins's trust and love, the younger sister Sasha died before changing teeth, and she is like a seed, she fell in the child / palace of Catherine, She chose what she wanted to hide and shelter – a safe, happy and warm place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seed sprouted in the fertile land, and eventually he would become a towering giant tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha resurrected on his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
