			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The members of the "Masoyye" of Poseidon Island will use "own language" when they are necessary, that is, communicate with each other in black language - "everything is normal" Things are going smoothly; I wish Hepton’s little beauty "Happy Birthday", which represents the transport of smuggled goods or drugs, the ship called "Little Beauty" has arrived safely in Hepton; implied once with the name of the song with time The exact moment of jailbreak activity; "drunk" represents unacceptable; "dirty things" are gold; some people say to a prison gangster: "Give you a sapphire." Don't misunderstand, this is not to make him good. Dressing up, "Sapphire" stands for parole in black, meaning that the mob is not far from "wake up" (released from prison). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The northern gangsters also have their own slang words. When they say that they want to get some "sherbet", they don’t go to the restaurant, but go to the hunger, because "fruit "Dew" stands for blood, and because of this, murder or serious injury is called "wet hand" by them. People who "wet their hands" will need a lot of "lubricants" (money) to "tour" (escape) so that they don't As for being "clawed" (arrested), he was thrown into the "emperor's palace" (prison) with a "bangle" (handcuffs). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people in the south and the north certainly can’t say together, although they have similar parts in their slang, but who will go to close their own enemies? It. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Peter can’t just confess his doubts in this way. The priest is a shameless, daring guy, but he doesn’t want to change himself. Become a free radio station that everyone can listen to. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fr. Peter asked Olosa’s mosquitoes, actually asking the northern nephews gathered here, his fears are nothing wrong, the arms calculated in containers, There are also a large number of mobs who have been called up. Even if there is a guarantee, who knows if Mrs. Crowe will suddenly go crazy? The answer to the priest is for both money and northerners, and they are about to fight with another region. If it was misunderstood by "Masoy", it was really dangerous and ridiculous, and then Father Peter tried to ask how long the war might last, and the priest told him that the priest wanted to know the cause of the war. . Hey, this is not within the scope of ordinary news, and selling this news is likely to provoke Mrs. Crowe, if the people of Poseidon want to know, go and investigate, anyway, they can’t emerge from the mouth of the priest. Come, as for the so-called effective time, the priest extended it twice, and someone asked him to shirk it - because the war would break out in three months. But he didn't lie, because the news will be known in three months, let alone half a year later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The news that Constantine gave them was. Forty-eight hours later, he will bring them 200 million yuan worth of diamonds - the payment is 100 million yuan, but it is better to change these diamonds into money than the San Diego family. On the face, the handling fee is very low. But it must be. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to make full use of the manpower, Besib and Sasha were arranged in a two-bedroom family suite, when Father Peter returned, two The boy is in the small meeting room... well, doing homework. They went out of business this time, brought a suitcase of textbooks and homework books, and a few dozen papers. Father Peter really wants to see what the northern shackles, who are secretly checking their luggage, will look at when they see this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father and Besib said today, "You can go out and play," he said. "We didn't get the money before we were all Safe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are large groups of mosquitoes outside, I don't know why, Besib's blood is particularly attractive to them, but like most boys. If you can choose between writing homework and going out to play, they will definitely choose the latter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We will go out tomorrow," Sasha said. "Do a reading exercise today."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Father Peter shrugged when he saw Besib, spread his hand and said that he could do nothing. He has not tested act and has not tested sat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am definitely the poor worm who has to do my homework while doing business," Besib said, but he just complained a joke. "Do we read the book?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"See the school’s required reading," Sasha looked for. "I brought it, look at this. Ben, very suitable,."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The story of the devil?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Almost." Sha said that he had read the book in his father's memory when he was six years old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How are you feeling?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not very good," Sasha honestly admitted: “A lot of people will feel like crying when they read this book.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib looked at him. "I thought we should read a more relaxed book, given what we are doing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha is looking for another At the time of this book, Besib suddenly changed his mind - "No," he said. "Let us read that book."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This The book has only 130,000 words. Besib and Sasha looked at it by head. It is not so much a book describing the devil. It is better to say how to describe a group of teenagers. The book that fell into a demon, the whole book presents a dark, chaotic and desperate scene, from shallow to deep, and finally thick like a dirty swamp - the main character Ralph was saved at the end He has not been killed, and other living children can return to civil society, but - is this really over? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They were so elated when they killed their companions," Besib said. "They killed three people and put the wild boar and companion’s head in the pile. On the end, I can finally go home with a good end."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So we will be creepy." Sasha said that if it is the temperament of resoluteness, dare to obey The doctor’s suggestion is that the captain who killed all the people’s squadrons on the island, he will certainly not hesitate to kill all the children, just like those who are already out of the army, those children are just Only the beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha bowed his head and flipped the book: "You said they killed three people. I remember only Simon and pigs?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And Ralph," Besib said: "Ralph is dead."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He changed his position Lying down, put your head on the legs of Sasha, and put your legs on the armrests: "Forget it, let us think about the place where we are happy. It’s no big deal for a group of children to kill a few people. Saying that there is a nuclear war in the world, how many people will die, millions, tens of millions?" He said with a sigh of relief: "Guess what I thought? Sasha, we ruined Abby's children's boxing match, but Constantine took over and we saved a few thousand people, but they brought them hundreds of millions of arms. The war broke out. Even in a small area, how many people will be because of those metal boxes. What's in it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is exactly what 'those people'... Hope." Sasha said, he looked at the table. The scrambler, the small red light above, flashes, indicating that it is working, ensuring that no conversations in this room will be eavesdropped: "Do you know why there are so many regions and countries willing to join the federation? Because of the federal At the beginning of its establishment, a bill was established, any rights not granted to the federal by the federal members, and the Constitution does not prohibit them from owning these rights. They will, as always, belong to the federal members and the rights of the people - the federal constitution for the region and the state Whether it is possible to leave the federation and remain silent, the regions and countries that have joined the federation have never given the right to secede to the federation. Therefore, once they want to leave the federation, they can be separated. This is legal, and the federal can neither impose sanctions. Nor can it stop the use of force by public opinion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
