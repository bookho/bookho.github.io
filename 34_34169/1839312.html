			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie’s gossip is still accurate. After a brief lunch, they rested for half an hour. The head of the team came over and announced that the boys with the Fly Fishing Medal could Participate in the afternoon fishing activities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because these two schools are adjacent to the Grand River, there are still quite a few people who get the Fly Fishing Medal, and the rest are only three-thirds. If not, they will go with the instructors to the nearby bushes and woods to peel dry moss, collect the burning branches, pick wild berries and look for mushrooms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two new volunteers, the residents of the original small village, arrived at their campsite at around two in the afternoon with a dozen fishing rods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They even took the head of the group, a total of three adults, standing in the flow of the riverbank in the order of the head, the middle, and the tail, the boys put on the water pants, keep The necessary distance, standing between them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remember to shout when the fish comes up," said the head. "Attention to your feet, look up at any time, bow your head and see where you have gone," he Twisted the eyebrows and said: "It is not allowed to go to the place where the water can not pass above your waist, and it is not allowed to stand on the prominent stone!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baoer. Douglas snorted. He is at the very end of the second paragraph, relying on him is a volunteer, Besib and Sasha are arranged in the first paragraph, close to the head, Charlie with brown eyes and a second, ahead of the third volunteer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are squid, squid, squid and squid here." The head said: "We have received a total of three permits, each The license can catch four squid and squid, squid 16 to 18 inches, squid 13 to 15 inches," he patted the equipment package at the waist, "I will help you measure," he said slyly. Thanks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, there is a limit to the amount of fish that can be taken back. There is almost only one person, if anyone exceeds this number. That means someone must return empty-handed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The river is gentle, the deepest places where the volunteers have already passed, determined that only the adult's chest, the position of their flying fishing water is not over the knee. Even so, standing in the clear, untouchable stream of water, you can still feel the sharp thrust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heads and volunteers are empty. The children looked at the fish and they looked at the children. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fly fishing, the style of Besib and Sasha is completely different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishb doesn’t like to walk, he stands on the shoal, letting the water hit his calf, he is inside the fishing rod brought by the new volunteer A metal full wheel, butterfly brake system with one-way bearing was chosen. The flying line uses the rocket line and has a backup line. His gesture of waving the fishing rod was firm and direct, without a little fancy—stretched by a straight line of fishing line, and then the sharply pulled fishing rod made a “whistling” sound in the air, with a pointed tip like a rocket. The name of the flying line draws a letter "q" in the air - the river continues to flow forward. Can't see any difference, Besib walked two steps forward, concentrating, the floating white bait was floating on the dark gray-green water surface... It was an exhalation effort, a small cluster of reversed water splashes. Come out, swallow the bait with one mouth! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The fish is coming!" he shouted, and several of the fishermen approaching him immediately closed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a big fish. Besib's fishing rod immediately bent and squeaked, the flying line straightened, the fish slammed out of the water, and slammed into the water, Besib turned the fly fishing wheel to release the line, the fish on the river Fluttering his body. Pulling out a white wavy line, Besib took the line, the line was getting shorter and shorter, and the straightness was frightening - the fish was pulled away from the water, and Besib grabbed it. Sitting on the stone and taking off the hook, the head went over and gave him a measure. The luck was really good. A 18-inch fine scale scorpion, blue fish skin, black spots with a small yellow circle outside, belly Snow white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want to continue?" The head of the team watched the boy put the fish in the fishing rod on his side, saying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They returned to their original position and Sasha has been re-released Line, walking forward, waving the fishing rod skillfully while walking, flying from right to left, flying to the left shoulder, bypassing the back from the left shoulder, turning back to the right front, the bait spinning around him in the air, like acrobatics or The ribbon in the dancer's hand is as beautiful. The head of the group stared at him to see if he had walked through the prescribed waterline. He stood near the groin, the rotation stopped, the flying line was pulled out, and the bait was like a real moth or scorpion. Flying over the ground, a big mouth that was as greedy as before was swallowed up and swallowed it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very different from his appearance, his treatment is more violent than Besib - he didn't even give the prey too much to struggle, only one back and forth, the unfortunate fish was high with the flying line Flying, almost squatting on the head of Besib. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, his echo of "the fish is coming" swayed back and forth between the valleys. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a squid. But it’s a pity. The size doesn’t match.” The head said, check the fish mouth: “You are a rude little guy.” He shook his head. Hold the dark gray cone fish in both hands and put it in the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It immediately shook his head and fled lively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have not waited for them to squander enough, and suddenly there was a shout in front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s Charlie, the thin boy is struggling to move in the water, holding the fishing rod in both hands in the direction of the current. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the front of him about thirty feet, the water is boiling like a pot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a big fish." Besib said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Charlie followed the line and followed, he also looked at the side and waist, to see where the water went, and the stones surrounding the water surface. His whole person was leaning back involuntarily, and the hat fell into the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fishing rod was bent into a u-shape, and the fish was out of the water. It was a big fish, and the silver was shining - the water had already reached Charlie’s waist. He is still insisting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly slipped under his feet, and the whole person fell into the water, there was just a height difference, the river was tumbling, and they could only see the roots in the white water. The fishing rod still standing stubbornly above the water. The volunteer standing at the front is coming over, but he can't catch up with the speed of the river for the time being. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Abandon the fish," the volunteers in the village shouted: "Give up the fishing rod."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Bishb gave the fishing rod to Sasha, Charlie was going down the river and would pass them in a few seconds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head suddenly reached out and held his shoulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has an obvious anxiety on his face, but his eyes are very firm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a stone not far away, the size of their tent, the fishing rod passed by, and then one hand stretched out of the water - was swallowed by water However, the fishing rod was still raised high - the next moment, Charlie suddenly emerged from the water, he stood up, walked to the shallows of the river beach, while walking, while turning the flywheel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good guy," the head shouted with joy: "He is closing!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie was on the line, Sasha and Besib gave him the position. As he walked closer to the river bank, no one helped. He finally pulled the big fish up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fish is almost as long as his entire upper body, black back, but not squid or squid, even if it is size, it is destined to be Put it back, but Charlie didn't feel frustrated, even after he couldn't catch a fish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flying fishing is extremely labor-intensive. After about two hours, the event is over. The Boy Scouts who collected firewood and moss have set up a bonfire, and the Boy Scouts are solid. The wok was taken out. The fish caught today was cut cleaned and put into the pot, added with salt and pepper, and the mushrooms found. The delicious taste is almost unprecedented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib and Sasha once again checked the campfire, rubbish, inside and outside the tent, and urged the team members to spray the insecticide before going to sleep. Very popular with the team members, because the smell is very good, and the insects are much more resistant than the pungent insecticides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When everyone wants to sleep well, someone else has an accident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie was rushed out by Boa. Douglas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was barefoot, wearing only vests and shorts, his hair was unkempt and he was embarrassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The volunteers in the village have already gone back. There are only instructors and heads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
