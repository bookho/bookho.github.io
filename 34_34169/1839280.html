Hopkins said, with a whimper, he looked down at the cup, and Hufu nervously groaned. Rub your fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That must be a terrible nightmare." Hufu said with sympathy, he touched the residue of the glass when he moved his feet, the glass fragments were on the floor tiles. There was a harsh sound between the plastic soles. "I am sorry, Hopkins, I thought I smelled the bitterness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is indeed bitter Hopkins said that he stood up from the wicker chair and touched a piece of crystal with a red thumb: "Do you think it can be restored?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huffman looked at Hopkins with suspicion, and shook his head a little slowly: "No... Of course not, I will lose you one."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins is not sure if Hufu knows that this is an antique crystal glass from the Bow and Glassware Company, each worth $1,750, which is equivalent to his weekly salary - But it didn't matter, Hopkins lowered his head and stared at the pile of expensive pieces for a while, making sure they didn't jump. After re-bonding, I breathed a sigh of relief: "Please wait for me for a while," he said, then walked through the room and into the bathroom. Five minutes later he returned to the terrace, and Hufu packed the pieces. He picked them up, gathered them together, and placed them on the linen mats that were originally stacked under the wine glasses. The fragments were not fascinating by the warm sunshine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sit, Hufu." Hopkins said that his face could not see the traces of tears, his voice was soft and calm. With a little sadness, it seems that it was a heart-wrenching nightmare. Hufu shook his head. "The principal asked me to inform you." He said: "We have been going for a while."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Inter-school football league?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Besib said: "From the next Start on Friday, before Thanksgiving."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about Halloween?" Beppe asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We will hang enough pumpkin heads on the football field," Besib said with a sigh of relief: "And the players' trouser pockets are stuffed with candy, and the referee wears a black robe and a sickle."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you do with your homework?" This is Sasha asking, he just came out of the bathroom, and the towel was on his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pray." Besib replied bluntly: "The Virgin will answer me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "How many games will there be?" Beppe asked with great enthusiasm: "There will be many people who want to see it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the second game, the league is a point system.” Besib said: “I hope they don’t want to see how my nose is swollen or break my arms and legs.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Every year, the league will cause a concussion of 43,000 to 67,000 people." Sasha added: "I think this is the most worrying thing."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bessib screamed at him, "I’m glad you recovered,” he muttered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Concussion, fracture, and even the most severe visceral rupture or the spine was broken, the latter half of the sputum, the heavy died on the spot." Hufu said "This is inevitable. Everyone will be injured in every game."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The team of the Grande team?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Poor old John fell yesterday and broke, before any of the players." Hufu said: "This is only temporary, we will find other people to replace him as soon as possible - - Just a season, dear. We have seen your resume and certificate, you are qualified for this position."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about children here?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Temporarily taken care of by your assistant physician," Huff shrugged. "This is the only way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins was silent for a while, just when Hufu thought he would refuse, he nodded: "Okay." He said with a sigh of relief: "Tell me, we ? & Nbsp;; & nbsp; & nbsp Where have to go "<br <br /> & nbsp />;"White Salt City."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishb said: "It is our first stop." He looked at Sasha with hope: "Prosperity, vastness, scenery Beautiful, fresh air. People are kind."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you mean?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I mean "Bishb said: "Even if you don't want to cheer for my first battle, you can at least play and go to the football game."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishb is eager to put an entire Mexican bean roll into his mouth, simmering with a barbecue sauce German sausage. It is coated with mustard and ketchup for a rich and exciting taste. A group of young men and women in white blouses and black trousers/long skirts walked by him. They are well-proportioned and beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you think?" Besib said to the people around him: "This should be a good place, but I always feel a little weird."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't like it here." Sasha said lazily, he had a cup of grapefruit juice in front of him, and a piece of specialty ice cream was given by the boss next to the grapefruit juice coffee. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warmth of the rose scented from the middle of the two boys, the sun was shining, the sky was clear like a shit plate, white building Behind the clouds-like redwood trees, the tower-shaped tower is exposed, and the top of the tower shines with golden dots. The buildings on both sides of the road are neat and tidy like a children's toy house. The vehicles on the gray wide road are spotless, and occasionally you can see a small motorboat behind the car (a big lake near Baiyan City), the car. The people inside, both men and women, are ruddy, smiling, and sometimes you can see a dog sticking out his head from the window and vomiting his tongue to you with ease. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It reminds me of the town." Sasha took a sip of grapefruit juice slowly: "I told you a little... yes, that is That town, a group of supervisors or future supervisors."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib remembered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh," he said, "I am sorry, I didn't notice this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't matter," said Little Hopkins. "I'm just complaining. You know that I'm not in a good mood recently. I don't like it. It doesn't matter if I come here. I don't want to come here because I like it." He poked the pink ice cream carelessly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of people slowly passed through here, they seem to be still in the last century, everyone who enters their line of sight can get a smile and a brief blessing of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"True image." Sasha muttered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishb didn’t talk, he ate three bean rolls, and after five sausages, he seemed to understand something: “I know it’s weird— Sasha, there is no 'bad person' here." No jealousy, no tramp, no, no idle, young girl who is swaying everywhere, you can't even see a guy who is not dressed neatly - even the capital of the western continent may not be able to There is such a "clean". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The supervisors in Baiyancheng account for 50% of the total population. I mean the kind of conviction," Sasha said: “Honesty, sincerity, chastity, kindness, kindness, and doing good things for all people – this is their creed. Anyone who is a supervisor or who may become a supervisor can get their selfless help... In their teachings, laziness is also a great sin. So... the unemployment rate in Baiyancheng is very low."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It sounds very good." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The real situation is indeed very good," Sasha said: "If there is that president, the employment rate of the entire Western continent can be raised to the same level as Baiyancheng. Maybe he can be re-elected for ten years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe this is really a good place, just not for us." Besib drank the last bit of grapefruit juice "I have to go back before the coach roars over the entire White Salt City, together?"<br /><br />&nbsp;& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No," Sasha said. "I am going to look around."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha Hopkins wants to see The place to see is the sanctuary of the sect, which is a gorgeous and magnificent church group like a snow-capped mountain. They have stood in the center of Baiyan City for nearly five centuries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
