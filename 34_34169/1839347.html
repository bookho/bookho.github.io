			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Constantine asked them to continue to torture the young man who was on the verge of collapse, and he and others rushed to the remote village where his face was like The person splashed the liquid nitrogen, and the dough became an ice shell. Just a little bit of force can be used to uncover the hot, bloody, complete one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yelena’s younger brother has been patient and dare not say that his sister has stolen the dog’s things for the entire eight years. And Crovin’s son is only six years old. Cautious Constantine certainly had his entire set of procedures before acknowledging the child, but Yelena was a nurse before she became a thief. She knew many doctors and accompanied several of them to sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They turned the cabin where Yelena’s lover bought it, and did not find Yelena, nor found a diamond. Her lover did not know. Trace - the mobs began to disassemble the floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orlosa’s house is very strange, from the outside, whether it is cement or wooden house, there is a distance from the ground, they They are all long-legged. The reason people do this is because the grounds of Orlosa are time-sensitive—on the permafrost that never melts, harder than steel, is a four-foot-thick topsoil. In the cold weather of ten months, the highest temperature is only minus twenty degrees, mixed with soil, the topsoil of sand and ice is almost as strong as the permafrost, but the temperature rises to more than 20 degrees. In the months, the surface of the soil will melt, become loose, or the house will be too hot, and it will turn them into unbearable mud. The destroyed foundation will make the house deform, skew, or simply Collapsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the aborigines and new immigrants of Orlosa will build a house with dense piles and hold the house up high. That's why you can't see more than seven floors in Orlosa and the surrounding area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the pile foundation and pile foundation, it was sealed. The floor frame is on the top of the pile foundation, and there is a large space between the floor and the permafrost layer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They quickly found Yelena, and a young man. The permafrost layer, which is always 8 degrees below zero, keeps the body intact, but it doesn't look like it died four hours ago. The thugs asked their neighbors, the neighbors were an old woman, and in such hot weather, she wore a skirt and a woolen headscarf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to do about this?" she said with vigilance: "The two are good children."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We found their bodies," the mob said. And got out of the pocket, the police badge, the real badge, he worked in the police station in Orlosa. Also works for the Cloven family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old woman was blindfolded in her mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When was the last time you saw the woman?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The last of June A weekend.” The old woman said: “I remember very clearly, because my son invited them to join us in Ensa and the festival.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old woman’s son from the door The back came out, he was on the upper body, wheat-colored, shiny skin. Muscular, with hair scattered, with the unique low forehead of the Aboriginal people, collapsed nose, thick lips, black eyes sharp like an eagle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you know what relationship they are?" said Constantine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The relationship between husband and wife." The old woman’s son said poorly: "They took the ring that only the married person can wear and showed it to me." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh. They all know that they are laughing at you, Constantine Crowe, the heir to the family, but just a poor worm that is being played by women - they screamed these two in the living hell of Cloven The next year's goods are called husband and wife, but they don't know the woman. The daughter-in-law is his, Constantine Cloven, her lips are his, his tongue is his, his neck is his. The chest is his, the fat is like a mare's butt is also his. Everything is his, he is her king, her master, her god - he ordered her to breast augmentation on the first day of watching Yelena, because her pair had a 36d chest against Constance Ding is far from enough - and since she was selected, the things that are fascinating are no longer hers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She went to her, brought back a pair of basketballs so big, she held them, like holding a pair of bombs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How much is the big rabbit called Constantine’s heart, he kissed them, bite them, leaving deep scalps, also He left the scratches on his nails and he used a whip to pump them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did she let the garbage do this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, they lived like a husband and wife in this tattered hut, and it’s just stupid to think that Crowton is almost laughing. The woman’s momentary rise, she sneaked here, mixed with a garbage, completely do not consider if he was discovered, her parents, her brother, her, and the little hybrid of unknown origin Like, she is so selfish, indifferent, and he can't change her gratitude and admiration for her love and charity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what a decent thing to mix with these two stinking pieces of rotten meat? A group of indigenous people, barbarians who migrated from the East, whose concept of marriage was limited to diamond-studded rings—they didn’t know how sacred and solemn the couple was, they used to live in a dwelling, they loved adultery, or they Chaos lun and hybrid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not a proverb that says so, the people are in one place, and the beast is more willing to stay with the beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few minutes later, Constantine found all kinds of excuses - he could frame them in connection with this diamond robbery, or they could instruct those young preparations. The mobs stole some "white medicine" to plant, or concocted a series of corpse cases, and then indexed the line here - these barbarians have their own festivals and sacrifices every year, he can let them accuse them of evil Killing while killing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This way he can erase his shame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, this is almost impossible, not the problem he can do, but the power of the Cloven family in Orlosa has not yet expanded. To the aborigines who can fight these embarrassing and cruel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the residents of Orlosa, the aborigines accounted for more than 50%, and they have lived here for hundreds of years, they are familiar with this, Love here, good at using everything here - no one wants to drive them away or put them in jail, but these aborigines are both united and intelligent, even if they only rely on intuition, they can also know those from Where are the inland people strong and weak, just like the wolves facing a large group of wild reindeer--when the aristocrats control it, they cut off the supply line of grain and coal; after the nobles were driven away, they started Destroy the heating pipes and wires, and they can still spend a long winter without relying on them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
