			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose of the Virgin Mary is less than a week later, although the sun is no longer so hot, Poseidon Island and the surrounding area are as warm and humid as ever. The olive groves entered the harvest season, and women and older children walked into the woods and picked a string of burgundy fruits in the fragrant air. They were piled up in baskets and transported to the mills. Within one day). In order to maintain the unique and wonderful original flavor of the local olive oil, the processors insist on the old slow, seemingly inefficient pressing method - the cleaned and picked olives are mashed by a mill and hammer and fed into the press. The plate, then press the olive juice with a squeezer, and finally use the oil-water centrifuge - this is perhaps the only modern object in the mill - to separate the oil and water, the bright oil needs to be filtered before it can be loaded into the dark Glass bottle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Men are responsible for crushing, shipping and selling. The women of Poseidon Island still adhere to the tradition of hundreds of years, in addition to going to church, their own fields, once a week of market, "docile daughter" and "quiet wife", "responsible Mothers rarely leave the line of sight of their fathers, husbands and sons. They are always busy... The house is cleaned every day, the orchards and livestock need fine care, and the men and their clothes must be clean and body On the face of the face, the children's appetites are better than a meal – they don't have the desire to be free, and they don't have the strength – is it better to sit down and eat a cup of cheese or hook a lace? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the most generous and tolerant head of the family will occasionally travel with their own family, but more men will choose to go home? Bringing gifts, this is enough for them to be content. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be mentioned that they are not as ignorant and ignorant as the outsiders imagined - "Tang" Chegal is an enlightened person, Poseidon There are schools, libraries and networks. If they have satisfactory academic performance, they can also get rich scholarships. It is enough for her to complete the entire university under the supervision and help of her father and brother. One is from a certain sea god island. Female writers in remote towns have even won worldwide literary awards. But as Sasha saw in the past few years, the women of Poseidon, as well as the men, seem to have never been dissatisfied with the doubts about the existing life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They stayed in the house, bowed their heads down the street, prayed in the church, wrapped their clothes tightly, put their hair up or combed their hair, Married women will wear a headscarf, and their eyes will never look directly at someone for a long time. It is a recognized, frivolous and rude behavior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it is conceivable that when a girl who is almost completely different from them, the exotic girl will appear in the gravel, the oyster shell paved roadway and the white sand beach, how many boys will be curious The eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially she is still so beautiful--and bold, John Carson’s daughter doesn’t seem to realize how outdated she is from here, at first, That is to say, after two or three days of horror, after uneasiness, she explored the nest like a chicken that had just grown feathers. When John Carson and his friends and subordinates were busy dividing, dissecting, extracting, and analyzing the three years or four ages they had received in the shallow sea, his daughter’s attention and curiosity had been The attraction of the sea god islands - for the girls who lived in the federal capital of the Western Continent for the first 15 years, in any case, it is like the island that stayed a hundred years ago. Mysterious and interesting - the blue ocean of jewels, the white sandy beaches, the black reefs, the verdant olive groves and vineyards, the orange houses, the mottled walls, the rugged gravel roads, the wells in the middle of the town square. The Madonna, which is everywhere, reminds people of the three bells that go to Mass... It’s all like a little hook that hooks the girl’s heart... well, if all of the above is not enough, then there is More fascinating things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qizi has never seen such a boy before, no doubt, beautiful, his appearance is not only outstanding in men, even women Several can match him (including those that Chiz saw on TV and pictorials); he is very good at water, in the sea, like a dolphin, or a shark, because sometimes he looks fierce ——The teenagers on Poseidon Island are more violent and aggressive than the boys in other places. Their wars are not limited to the land. The sea is also one of the best battlefields for them to establish their respective status – the order of entering the water, (just as literally The meaning of the meaning of the time, the joke of provocative gestures or a heavy talk of not talking about light and light ... can lead to a fierce and thorough battle. No matter which time, the boy did a very beautiful job. He is good at speeding up and slowing down. He lifts his arm around his enemies and grabs his neck. Then he squirms like a crocodile biting an antelope. If there is a reef around him, he will put his opponent on the reef. On the other hand, let those sharp shells replace the knives to tear the flesh of the victim and the victim. If not, he will smash the other into the bottom of the sea and submerge the unlucky with the sea sand until the latter is comatose due to suffocation or surrender in time. gesture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once they were very close to Chiz - Chiz couldn’t be sure they didn’t really see the back of the reef or didn’t care at all, she only knew the winner was swimming It was only a few feet away from her when she opened... Chiz knew that it was an illusion, but when he swam through the reefs she was hiding, she did feel the amazing heat clearly, she thought she was sure It is like a lobster that has only been thrown into boiling water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He glanced over her and the sea was clear. She saw his eyes. At the beginning, she thought his iris was dark gray-blue. When he left, her heart was calming down. In her memory, she was surprised to find that it was a rare, wonderful color between the blue and the purple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She also saw that he used a harpoon fishing, which is definitely worth buying a ticket, the whole process is like a camera shutter, sharp The harpoon penetrated the dark blue lid and body of the long-finned squid. At least 30 pounds of prey were in the final struggle. The blood polluted the surrounding water. He reached out and raised his eyes, his eyes calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His body is as tight as a fish, full of strength, shining in the sea, and Chiz can't control himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the ethics of the Western Confederation, Chiz is a good girl who is clean and self-satisfied. She stubbornly believes that her own virgin body must be retained until adulthood. But she also dated the interested boy. Watching movies, eating ice cream, dancing, hugging, kissing, etc. is not strange to her, but she has never had such feelings and impulses. "A good boy." Chiz said to herself, she is determined to try it, do nothing, and watch the baby slip away from the eyes is not the habit of the Carson family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She did not mention this to her father, John Carson, Chiz knows that his father must be opposed, she does not know why she is smart The father will hold the same view on most of the Western Confederacy in this matter: everyone on the island of Poseidon is a mob or a guy who is about to become a mob. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes and heart of Chiz, Poseidon is an old-fashioned tradition, but also a peaceful and peaceful place, she walks through the narrow small in the morning mist Lanes and steep streets, tracing black wooden doors, painted wheels, roadside alcove of the Virgin Mary carved in stone or wood, daisy and roses hanging under the window and on the wall, kindly women and taciturn The man...no robbery, no, no murder, she walked peacefully in the robber's lair without any hindrance and harassment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chez Carson didn’t know that just three years ago, the road under her feet was once reddened by the blood of human blood, the rebellion of the heirs. As well as the leader’s turmoil in the entire island, the aftermath remains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chiz crossed the square, she is going to take action today, and she must do some preparation before the action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The side of the square is occupied by the church. There is a small market on the side of the church. The main products are fish, some vegetables and fruits, pickled products and wine, only in the morning. Open, the fog is gone, it is over, the buyer and the seller are almost all locals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The marinated olives are arranged in a round scorpion, one next to each other, densely packed like a sunflower disk; slender sea otter Silver-stained, sardines with bones removed, black sea urchins cut open, five- or six-foot marlins, tuna and squid are cut into various ingredients and neatly discharged onto ice. The huge octopus, shells and lobsters are stripped clean at the buyer's request; the corners are crowded with spices and vanilla stalls, and several old women hang their necks around their necks, piled high in them Goat cheese made by yourself - there are only a few women in the market. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qizi did not notice this - the fruits and vegetables were arranged on the steps of the church, and the benevolent God and his agent did not seem to care about his residence. Temporarily separated by a businessman. Round headed eggplant, tennis-like onions, big red tomatoes, black-and-black raspberries, golden pears, nectarines with a seductive butt... they sway a layer of white marble Stepping, the girl looked around and found what she wanted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She bought some lemons, the price is very affordable, the buyer is a young boy, very embarrassed, almost dare not look up at her. Compared to the young girl from the local island of Poseidon, Chiz’s wearing is unusually arrogant – basically a conservative version of the bikini. The well-developed chest is completely outlined by the fine and elastic fabric, limbs, shoulders and waist. With the abdomen exposed, the light brown hips cover the undulating skirt - better than nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old woman selling goat's milk cheese shook her head when Chiz left the market with a small paper bag containing lemons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now is a good time to eat oysters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People on Poseidon Island will not eat oysters like the people on the mainland, dig the oyster meat out of the shell and wrap it in flour to fry or throw It is considered to be an extremely sissy practice to cook in a creamy soup with mushrooms. They only like to eat raw oysters. It is best to just pick them from the reef and send them directly into the mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
