No matter what comes up, the old Tom has the confidence to move his finger back half an inch in a moment, and a guy can open a big hole in his or his head or chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s me," the cries shouted as there were seven or eight steps left. At that time, his head had not even surpassed the end. The line formed by that step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Tom is relieved, he is over sixty years old, his hearing and memory are not as good as before, but he can barely use this sound and the image in his head. In connection, he lowered his muzzle and let it rush to the floor: "How come you ran here? Is the school okay?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Basically solved The guest answered politely: "The mayor is a bit worried, so let me see if there is anything I need to help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No need to help. "Like all the old men who refused to accept the old, the old Tom raised his beard: "It's just a sick groggy woman and a six-year-old child! Besides, isn't John and Richard still below?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you think they have to do, they don't care when they play cards, even if you want to cut their heads, just don't It’s okay to mess with their cards.” The stranger said sourly, and walked slowly, first without a hat. After the shoulders, chest, and then the thighs, calves and feet, he stood in front of the old Tom, a little uncomfortable to squat: "You be careful," he said dissatisfied: "The gun is easy to escape. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Tom moved the shotgun again, and the finger was transferred from the trigger to the gun: "The coward." He took a sip and came to him. Behind him, it seems to be studying the door lock: "I warn you, kid." Old Tom said: "Don't move anything. When you are going to deal with the tiger, do you feel ashamed when you deal with the tiger? Who is the first to succeed? Yes, this is the rule." He wanted to stand up from the chair and turned to threaten him with a shotgun, but almost at the same time, the same heavy blunt thing knocked on the back of his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man fell forward, and the blood quickly flowed out of his white-skinned hair. He instinctively raised his hands and covered his head: "God. God," he shouted, and fell to the ground with his own shotgun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time may be a little hesitant, but when the old Tom squirmed forward and shouted for help, the murderer suddenly woke up, he ran over Once again, the weapon was raised. The next few times were more and more powerful. It was more and more determined. The steel axe used to cut the grapes was heavy and profitable, but the murderer used an axe to beat instead of axe. Cut, it first interrupted the old Tom's fingers, the palms, and then the hard skull, one after another, until the blood was splashed with the murderer's black long boots, the turbid yellow eyes protruding from the eyelids, The whole face was also tilted to one side and lived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gasped for a while, spit two times on the body of the old man, whispering a curse: "The coward!" Then temporarily drop the axe and grab the old Tom's The jacket, dragging him from the ground, opening the door to the utility room in the hallway, throwing him in with the dirty mop broom - in the process, maybe some action is too rude, then The shotgun was really ignited. It slammed and smashed a piece of square wood flooring with the foundation below, and scared the perpetrators. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accident made him whisper a few words, and finally calmed down, no longer heartbeat and a burst of cold sweat - he walked over to pick up the axe, aiming at the door latch and the lock on the door Cut down - this old lock is easy to slash, but it is very strong, he took a lot of effort to open the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young woman who was wanted by the agency was leaning on a makeshift bed. Unfortunately, she did not wear pajamas, but instead A white-necked thin-skinned shirt with a pair of maroon jeans, the corners of the shirt have a knot in the waist, a pair of black ankle boots under the pants, and the children around her are neatly--like Waiting for him, this thought flashed in the murderer's mind, and the more intense desires and critical needs were re-covered: "Bring the child, follow me," he said: "Unless you want to die Here, they told you." He said to Catherine, satisfied that the young woman had a look of surprise and fear on her face that was no longer so swollen because she had broken two meals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned like a western movie hero, looking at the back with his eyes, happily seeing the pretty blonde beauty clutching the child The hand swayed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should have been done this way, he thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was the first town resident to perceive the existence of the institution - the stupid woman trusted him, loved him, and took care of his identity and situation without hesitation And he is also a fool, actually closed her mouth because of her tears and pleading, he thought that he could at least get a pure wife, but the result, I do not know when to start, her money, beautiful Clothes, expensive jewels and fur are gone, every woman and child in the town can sing and enslave her freely, and every man in the town can enjoy her youthful body - except he! Because he is her lover, oh, it’s alive, he has a free biaozi lover, the most ridiculous thing is that he is not qualified to go to bed with him, because he doesn’t have a fixed house and work, he can’t help her. And shelter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even the old Tom, because of the daily dinner, can successfully become her guest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has nothing! Why can't he call that phone? The most unfortunate thing is here. When he used the toll-free number at the hotel, he was inadvertently heard by Mrs. Alan. She reported to the mayor, and the mayor summoned all the townspeople - for the best interests, they forced him. I handed over the phone number, or I drove him out of the town. He didn't want to go. He stayed in the town for the rest of his life. He was born here, baptized in the church, committed to the church, went to elementary school, middle school, and worked here. He thought that he would continue this way in the future, until he died, buried in the public cemetery behind the church... He is really a fool! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He could have taken the woman away, just like taking the woman now, how to toss how to toss, enjoy it, get tired after taking it Go and change a lot of money with the agency! He can travel around the world, and then find a beautiful, well-equipped, nursing home with competent doctors and cute nurses to spend the last few years in comfort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the real life! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine is about to vomit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She tried not to touch what the so-called savior had touched, but the emotions of the other party were so strong that it was like wearing no gloves Just put your hand into the internal organs, the feeling of dirty and sticky always wraps around Catherine's skin, it is difficult to peel off, but fortunately there is Sasha, the child's little hand is holding her neck, like mint liqueur The fresh scent comes from the soft, wooly hair, rubbing her neck and cheeks, and Catherine can control her resentment and hatred – at least not letting them appear on the surface. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sallow flake fell off Catherine's face, and she raised her hand and covered it slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the oatmeal and quiche that Mrs. Alan sent attentively went into the sewer, the sand with a melted oil pastel and a box of expired eyeshadows found from the bottom of the closet Give Catherine a must-have morbidity after eating deer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since that day, their food has been generously donated by the mice - God knows that Catherine first saw Sasha sitting in the black-pressed rat When the group received their offerings seriously, they almost couldn’t stand their own screams - but it must be said that these mice are quite capable, except for olives, cheese, pies, bread, nuts, They can also be packaged in milk, cream, whole fruit, fine canned caviar, small bottle of sauce... She and Sasha actually eat better than before in the past... as long as they can ignore cleanliness A silent wailing in the brain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These mice will turn their heads and dance when they dine... obviously to entertain Sasha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What surprised Catherine most was that these ashes, slick and slick animals were able to go to everyone in the town to follow Sasha’s orders. Personal personal belongings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The items they searched for were touched by Catherine one by one, feeling the emotions above, happy, happy, joyful, joyful, relaxed, gratified, sad, scared, upset, Tension, distress, depression... But the most is the desire and malice that is as sharp as acupuncture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha’s request is: In addition to desire and malice, it also contains “嫉妒” things, and then he picks out the belts, wallets, Cufflinks, etc. should belong to male carry-on items... held in your hands, contemplating for about five to ten minutes, the originals are returned to the mice - these "handled" items, Catherine can also touch without touching I feel that the above emotions have been forcibly expanded and strengthened... If the previous emotions feel like a magnet, then it is a real magnet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not hard to imagine that these dark desires, which were vigorously promoted and purified, would create a terrible and crazy poisonous wine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine clasped Sasha and forced herself not to pay attention to the brown smudges on the floor of the hallway and the pale hand that came out from under the counter. The index finger stretched straight, as if the murderer was accused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is an accomplice, or a mastermind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s going to be dawn."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The murderer’s executor said that even under the golden streetlight, his face was still pale as if he were in a black and white film, his fingers twisted on the buttons of the coat. Move, hiding his axe inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get on the bus," he ordered rudely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opposite side of the street, parked a 50% new black slope-shaped car, Catherine just hurriedly, even the specific shape of the car could not be seen clearly, Was forced to push up by the man behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man jumped into the car, the ignition started, and the car complained loudly and suddenly slipped forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the engine is getting bigger and bigger, the speed of the car is increasing again and again, and the town gradually shows its full appearance in the rearview mirror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
