			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie stood in front of the door, her little nose shrugged, something in the air made her feel a little uneasy, the little hand removed from the door handle, she Turned around, once again through the living room, from there back to the restaurant, the kitchen, open the back door, just like a kitten familiar and quietly slipped out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corridor behind the house is black and the moon shines on the water of the swimming pool. It should have been as bright as a mirror, but because Mary Kent has several consecutive The unintentional relationship of the week, with a thick layer of algae on it, if it is daytime, you can see it green as a new lawn - but this has nothing to do with Anne, so she regrets standing on the edge of the pool Man, Dolores Kent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little girl with a unkempt hair is barefoot, her face is gloomy, her t-shirt and jeans are all over, crumpled, and the thumbs of both hands are inserted In the trouser pocket: "Where are you going?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where am I going to have nothing to do with you." Unhappiness is just passing by, a child to Anne The plan didn't form any hindrance. She tightened her backpack and walked out from the shadow of the corridor. The moonlight of the fluorescent lights made the children's faces clear. Anne saw Dolores, and Dolores saw it. Anne's: "You can save your mind, Dolores," Annie said in a kind and disguised tone: "I won't stay here again." I have a better place to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dolores took a sniff and made a loud voice. "Mom is telling the truth," she said sadly. "You killed." Our younger brother."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not us, Dolores, just yours." Annie responded coldly: "And I suggest you not to bring Mary. If Kent’s words are true, people will send you together into the madhouse.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dolores looked at her as if she first saw Anne Kent, or It was she who tore her chest and jumped out of the body with a long-horned devil. "...I know, I know you did it," she stammered and said, "The spices are what you suggested. And vegetable juice, which you and Mary said... I can testify."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, you go, you can testify." Annie scornfully said: "They can't prove anything. Those things I found from the Internet and the book, according to the above statement, whether it is Basil, Hu , thyme or spinach is a lot of benefits... and I just suggested (she added the pronunciation of this word), I never stuck Mary's neck to pour spices and vegetable juice... Yes, I know now, They will be detrimental to pregnant women and fetuses. I will remember, "The girl like a little fairy in the moonlight smiled viciously: "I like new knowledge, do you think, Dolores?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tears flowed out of Dolores's dark eyes, and they slid over the cheeks and infiltrated into the bear's round neck shirt along the neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" She choked and complained: "Why are you doing this?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "This thing has been a little bit thin with me..." Anne was going to take all the cadres out as she used to, but she suddenly stopped, just like every crime before the devil was in her young Like the flames lit up in the soul, a thriving malice erupted from her chest, unstoppable: "Can you not move your brain so much?" She said softly: "I suspect they are already Condensed into pieces, you have to use a hammer to knock on the point - Dolores, you have a bad parent.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They don’t know how to use themselves reasonably The limited resources in hand - moving home, changing jobs, inheriting a waste farm that is thousands of miles away and useless - paid more than one million inheritance taxes, they can't even afford it A new car, and Mary Kent will actually be pregnant at this time! They didn't even think about you, and I, St. Thomas Church Elementary School is not cheap, Dolores, let alone those extra courses, my dear sisters, piano, calligraphy, painting... you don't think they are free Well - maybe you don't think it would matter if you go to a public elementary school, but I don't want to. In the children's welfare home, I have had enough of those dirty, dirty slums! I chose Kent because they made it. Commitment, a lot of things, they promised me a lot." Anne sighed regretfully: "They can do it - Dolores, in all fairness, I like Mr. Kent and Mrs. Kent, in some On the aspect, they are better for me than for you. Of course, my own efforts have played a lot of roles in it. Dolores, in any case, you have to admit that I am more than happy." She shook Shaking his head: "Unfortunately, they have made such an impulsive, reckless decision - this family can not afford three children, especially one of them is a baby, whether it is Still something else... I originally wanted to solve this trouble quietly." The short boots kicked on the wet grass: "That's best. When the farm is released, Mr. Kent's work stabilizes, Mary. Kent returns to the workplace - a veterinarian's income is not low, and now the embarrassing situation can be greatly improved... Dolores, your wheel shoes can buy new, you can also travel to the west, camping and horse riding... ...the ones you dreamed of."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't want those." Dolores shouted: "I only want my brother!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few birds flew out of the trees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s really noisy," Annie licked her lips. "You are disgusting with your heart," she said happily. "You dare to swear to God, you really Don't you feel happy when you know that there won't be a second child to snatch your mom and dad's love and attention?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dolores With her eyes wide open, her tears suddenly stopped, as if she had been scared back by the words of Anne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne squirted a breath into the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have been," Dolores said, very low, with a nasal sound, if Anne is not close to her, she must not hear: "I have been," said the girl at Kent's house: "I always think..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are my sister."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dolores rushed over to Anne, and always guarded Anne quickly retraced, side, and more Lores rushed, her body was hung up, but her hand was stalking everywhere. It grabbed Anne's backpack, and Annie lost her balance. The two fell in one after another. Swimming pool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The water in the pool is cold and cold, sticky, exudes a disgusting smell, and it’s too late to prevent it. Dolores swallowed a few mouthfuls of water, but fortunately she I was good at swimming, a few times floating and sinking, and finally came out of the water. She breathed fresh air, her eyes were burning, her feet were slamming... The turbid pool twitched and the little girl waved her arms hard. The pool wall was full of moss and aquatic plants. She couldn't hold it. She turned to swim in the water, where there were handrails and steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was covered in water, and she climbed ashore and squeaked in her ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Help me!" Someone shouted, the voice seemed very far away at first, and when Dolores dug the water in her ear, she found the sound. The source is close at hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie floats on the water, she looks worse than ever, she is desperately waving her arm, trying to catch the pool or swim near The water inlet is always sinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dolores remembers that Anne would swim more than herself, but the latter seemed to be tired of the beautiful dress and booties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold-brown eyes turned to Dolores, "Save me!" She cried out, "Help me, please!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dolores got up, she hurriedly turned around in the garden, couldn't find the pickpocket, and finally she found a rubber hose next to the pump She pulled one of them, pulled it out, and then held it about two or three feet, and extended her head to Anne, who was still in the pool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne cried and grabbed the life-saving straw, and she slowly followed the water pipe to the pool, and Dolores was able to meet her. , extended his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dolores’s hand was held tightly, and Annie raised her face and smiled at her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a crocodile biting a deer or a cow, Anne tightly wrapped her body in a beautiful dress and tumbling violently in the water, Dolores was her Curling and dragging down, even when it was too late to make a scream or figure out what happened, Annie held her breath and slammed down. Her hands clasped Dolores, she skillfully rolled in the water, she could It was said that the power beyond the adult made her easily gain the upper hand... After a few seconds, she let go of Dolores, who was already a little dizzy, swam up, and then stuck Dolores with her hand. Neck, press her down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even a child, the power of struggling is great, but she can’t touch Annie, Annie smiles in her dark water, she is ready Add a force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you still have a pain in your arm?... I think it must hurt very much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The ghost made it worse, and Streif’s words suddenly appeared in Annie’s mind. Her injured arm was as painful as a hot iron burn. She opened her mouth and water poured into her throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne wants to forget about this, she has successfully forgotten it just now - but this time her psychological suggestion didn’t work at all, her The arm was getting more and more painful, the pain got into the bones, flowing along the bone marrow, and she wanted to climb up the shore as soon as possible, only to find that her body was completely controlled by the pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
