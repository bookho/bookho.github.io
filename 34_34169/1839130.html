			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary. Kent’s head creaked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I have never heard of these things," she heard the harsh voice tremble back and forth between the cold glass and the wood. "The doctor did not say I haven’t seen it in magazines yet.” Her children have no problem at all! Once every three months, once every three months, four weeks after seven months, and once a week after nine months, she has never been absent - respiratory movement, muscle tone, fetal heart rate, fetal movement, amniotic fluid volume... ...maybe some numbers are not as good as they are... but they are just not what they want! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not surprisingly, very few people would pay attention to this kind of thing, and as I said before, you must take a 'big dose'...you Is there really no place to be uncomfortable?" Streif didn't seem to notice how rude she was. He stood up and leaned forward slightly. A pair of dark gray eyes were slightly down, and Mary reached out and blocked the abdomen. But I can still feel that the line of sight is passing through her palms, skin, fat and muscles... It directly penetrates her son. The palace feels like a real feeling that makes Mary tremble: "Bulgar," By the time she didn't consciously cling to the chair, Streif blinked. "Okay, okay," he comforted softly. He used this when he was Dr. Anthony Hopkins. Tone talk, this tone can well calm those uneasy emotions, just like stroking a bunny's hand, warmly, broadly, softly... gently touched up: "You definitely don't need Go to the hospital?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&n Bsp; "No!" Mary Kent was shocked, and she was ashamed of the rudeness and irritability contained in this answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, nothing, Mary, how about a cup of black marian (coffee, brandy, rum, syrup)? We can make him less Wine and ice, add more syrup."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary wants to refuse, but the action waiter has accepted the orders of Streif. But in three or five minutes, the black liquid was brought up, along with a free piece of chocolate. "This is for mom." The waiter said that his face has a rather prominent Caucasian character. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Italians love moms." Streiff made a gesture: "Drink, it will make you better."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary. Kent still did not go to the hospital after all, she put doubt and uneasiness together with coffee and chocolate Into my stomach...maybe too much, her stomach becomes heavy and oppresses the palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wholeheartedly wants to forget everything she just heard, but they are always whistling with the ominous imagination, she can't help but think of those fennel, cinnamon , star anise, pepper, pepper... and the delicious food that was made with them, and the first Anne who provided her with this recipe... she almost laughed at her own thoughts. How could she think that Anne is interested? Anne is just a child, a child who is less than ten years old. Even Mary Kent knows that spices and spinach juice can't appear too often in pregnant women's menus. How can Anne know... even if she knows that Why is she doing that? Letting herself have a miscarriage is not good for her at all. Yes, Mary almost wants to break her head and has no reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie won't do that, she knows she is a adoptive child, Mary and her husband will raise her and take care of her, but they will never be like love It is an unchangeable fact to love her like her own flesh and blood. It is human nature and instinct; not to mention the little babies, they also have Dolores. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dolores is a good boy." Streif said, while driving the car. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary was a bit confused at first, but she immediately understood: she might have inadvertently said the name of Dolores. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s amazing," the mother smiled a little: "Mr. Humbert always complains that Dolores is too stubborn and difficult to control. He prefers Anne. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Annie is also a good boy," Streif agreed. "You are a good mother, you have taught two." "Excellent child."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you." Mary shook her head tiredly, talking about her two daughters, her mood became better, "No, can't say Two, you see, Anne is not Dolores... You should have seen Annie's resume, we adopted this little angel more than a year ago, she has almost nothing to worry about, I have not been able to teach her What she doesn't need, she can make her own bed, do personal hygiene, comb the scorpion, match the clothes, do the homework, and help me do a lot of housework..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, I am not referring to this." Streiff stopped in front of a red light. "What I want to say is, Anne's heart." The state... is very good," he said in a hurry: "Know that an older child will show his best when he or she enters a adoptive family, and everyone will do the best for him. Everyone is in a room, happy, no quarrel, no indifference and cold reception - a veritable 'honeymoon period' built by the two sides, very beautiful, isn't it? But pay attention, this perfect and fragile glass Heaven will become a kind of pressure, they will have a sense of fear, they are afraid that they will break this wonderful thing... they can’t be tempted, they are cautious, they are wary, they don’t believe that others will allow them to make mistakes, fail, or Showing negative emotions such as depression, jealousy, hatred, etc... and because of this, they are difficult to integrate into another family, school, community, they are always out of place."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I think I am a bit impressed with this." Mary said when the car started again, she glared at the temple: "I remember applying for adoption." Nicole has been on this course. "She had almost forgotten it completely, Anne Kent into the milk as fast as a smooth integration into the coffee before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Straef’s little finger tapped on the steering wheel and patted a piece of music in his mind: “Yes, most adopted orphans. There is such a problem, but as far as I can see, Anne does not. She behaves like a real Kent family. Although her class and work are very good, she will be spoiled, angry, and proud. I will compete with Dolores, quarrel with her and even play a small conspiracy. If there is no explanation on the resume, I don’t think anyone can think of her staying at Kent for a year. So I have to say Mrs. Kent, you are doing very well in this regard, very good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Playing... What little conspiracy?" Mary sighed, "More Is Lorez blaming again?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Children usually have a competitive behavior." Streiff responded with an understatement: "When it comes to it, Mrs. Kent, if you like, you may wish to pay more attention to Dolores than she did - she used to I complained that she suspected that you and Mr. Kent no longer loved her and turned to love Anne Kent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary widened his eyes in disbelief," She said this?” After waiting for a positive answer, she raised her lips angrily: “It’s just stupid and hopeless!” she commented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am her mother!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
