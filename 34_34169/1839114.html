			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s really good.” The leader of the action team patted the shoulder of the “anaesthetist” with a kind of force between the boss and the friend. Can't be gentle, but it is never reminiscent of a sudden attack: "If you don't have us, we will have a big loss today."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anesthesia The teacher blinked and tried to control himself not to step back to avoid the closeness that made him feel alert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you talk to me?" The leader smugly grabbed his neck (the anesthesiologist thought, came) and lowered his voice: "How do you know where the guy will appear?" The intelligence team had already lost the target before they arrived at the scene. What was even more troublesome was that the hunters almost copied the prey to the prey - if there was no anesthesia Teacher's words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I read his information." The anesthesiologist said: "Just a guess."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "...hey, yes." After a while, this can be said to be the old hunter of the organization's own members, and let go of the anesthesiologist's shoulder: "You are a smart guy," he said: "Redouble your efforts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The anesthesiologist barely smiled: "Thank you... can I go to the toilet?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temporary action group celebrates this victory in a well-known local bar, where the bar’s wine and food are It's superb, the decor is unique, the compartment in the toilet is even more spacious than the hard seat box of most trains, and the lower half (below the waist) is covered with dark green tiles with ancient blue fabric wallpaper. The door is dark hardwood, decorated with lines, the toilet is white, and the toilet paper is placed on the brass tripod on the side of the door. Hooks - the compartment door handles and the same material, they are a standard ball, hollowed out in the middle, the button used to lock the door in public is like a eye without eyes, staring straight at each An alcoholic who enjoys a visit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The anesthesiologist swayed into the compartment, turned around and quickly closed the door, then slid his pants as quickly as possible. Sit on the toilet... but it’s too late, he has wet the whole piece and a part of the trousers. This makes the 36-year-old adult man both annoyed and ashamed. The worst part is that he has no way to do this. Since Alija, just think of the guy, the cold is like an antony of Anthony. Hopkins, the anesthesiologist can't control his bladder. "You can't go on like this." He said to himself slyly: "You can't..." He found a cell phone in his arms - the one that was originally sent in the poppy seeds. There are several dozen caller numbers stored in it, but there is only one caller. There is almost no outgoing number. He tried to reverse the game, but no one answered or was out of service. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The anesthesiologist opened his legs and slid in from the bottom of the toilet compartment. The inside of his thigh was hot and cold, and it was full of ugliness. Goose bumps. He stuffed the phone between the gaps in his legs and hung it over the dirty urine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as he releases his hand, he can get rid of the devil, even if it is temporary. He held the antenna of his mobile phone and let it dangling. If that Anthony Hopkins was hiding in this mobile phone, how good would it be, he could take the damn change together with the small eDonkey. Throw it into the smelly toilet, then press the flush button and rush them into the septic tank, and jingye, the stool and the urine will stay together, and the sewage truck will be pulled into a can and finally put into the sea or It is deep buried... This is an unbeatable wonderful place, and it is very suitable, suitable for the right, the appropriate bark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Got it, a voice in his head straight throat, you won't be willing to see how much he brings to you! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the anesthesiologist admitted that without Anthony Hopkins, even if he participated in many other tasks, he might not be able to get so much. Money, honor and respect, these, especially the last one, he almost never got it - he used to be far away in a safe place (such as behind others), be careful (not timid) and secure The goal is to solve the problem. Of course, this method is not only inefficient, but also easy to incur other people’s disgust and cursing, and even sorrow - especially when being robbed of prey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He used to think that he would go on like this forever, but Anthony Hopkins’s visit allowed him to see new opportunities – this is already on the agency’s list. The top ten ghouls proposed a good deal that was difficult to reject. The anesthesiologist provided him with all the information related to the "Babel", and the Lithuanian count and the descendants of the Italian Viscount, a pair of psychology Learning and sociology have a very high attainment, like high art, often participate in the appreciation of drama, elegant operas played by operas and large symphony orchestras, using the brains that no one can match, to analyze each object targeted by the organization (each The information can make him taste the taste from the head.) He can guess what they eat, what they drink, what they like, what they are used to, what kind of bed-going objects they will choose, what kind of car they will use, what kind of words will make He is nervous, angry or relaxed, looking for what kind of goal to start, why, what kind of action or discourse can make them timid, confused, out of control, revealing their feet... and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The anesthesiologist tried it with trepidation and it was hard to let go again. No, no, not that he was from a person in the morning (night) The neglected coward becomes a hero or a prophet - this change was almost exclusively known to him at first, but it was so wonderful - he no longer flinched, hesitated, and he felt like a heart before every action. A poor candidate who wants to copy someone else's papers, he is now well-informed. Ha, he even hopes that the exam questions can be difficult, because in any case, someone will prepare a clean and tidy correct answer for him. All he has to do is fill them in the space. Then take a beautiful "a" from the head of the organization. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He certainly knows the ultimate goal of Anthony Hopkins, whose beloved little son is receiving the most thoughtful "reception" in the "Babel Tower". The anesthesiologist knows what it is, if he is a father, he will desperately want to save his child who is less than the legal age from the standard spiritual hell, Anthony Hopkins The action is already slow - but standing on his own, the anesthesiologist still wants him to be slower, because as long as Anthony Hopkins begins... no matter whether it succeeds or not, his exams are no one Can pick up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this is a matter of time, the anesthesiologist has a hunch, and the cooperation between the two will come to an end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third night of the anesthesiologist’s return home, received another new Mission, Midnight, Anthony Hopkins called, the anesthesiologist sent out the information on his hand, the next night, the anesthesiologist enjoyed his other box of poppy seeds, got the Huo Special email from Dr. Pukins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After an hour, the phone rang, and Anthony Hopkins first politely asked him if he was satisfied with the analysis report and got a positive answer. After he was silent for a while: "...I remember you said..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The anesthesiologist smoked his nose for unknown reasons, he sat on the toilet There is a laptop on the knee, and the phone is stuck between the shoulder and the ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You said," Anthony Hopkins said: "Even if you are a dead person, you have to go through more than three inspections before you can enter the 'Babel Tower,' right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Yes." The anesthesiologist thought about it, he did say this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can feel the smile on the other end of the phone, "...thank you, sir, thank you very much, you did give me a lot of help," There is a small pause at the end, "...then, then."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh...yes...yes...will come again." No, he I don't want to meet this monster anymore. He is very satisfied with the distance between the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I only hope that the person can be satisfied too - the anesthesiologist pulled the shirt in front of the shirt, covered the thigh, and read the analysis report again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may be the last one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brown rock stands quietly at the junction of the three states," The architecture of the institution is like a faded crown, firmly stuck at the top of it, behind them is a vast expanse of gray wasteland and bloody red sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two-digit elevator is like the tears left by the candle, clinging to the smooth surface of this huge rock, they go up and down, stay up all night, for this People in medical institutions transport a large number of protective hygiene products, drugs, various medical equipment, daily necessities and even raw and cooked foods, and transport out discarded medical supplies and medical equipment, human tissues, limbs, and organs that are discarded after surgery or pathological sectioning. And so on - because of the special nature of the organization, these elevators are large, firm, stable, and set up a number of intelligent modules such as airtight, direct, first aid, etc. according to the inherent needs of general hospital elevators. You will also have the privilege of accepting at least 3 inspections during a short journey of nearly 100 meters - sometimes you only need to pause for a while, sometimes you need to stop in the middle, open the package according to the guard's request or show you in front of the probe. I don’t know what it’s all about, but as long as there is something wrong, the elevator will immediately become a real cell. Or the execution office of the death penalty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tom took a sniff and reluctantly opened the zipper on the large plastic bag in front of him - a full-faced adult man’s body exposed to the snow Under the light, all his hair has been smeared in the process of corpse disinfection, and he looks calm, his arms are placed on his chest, his legs are straight, and the man’s words are turned to one side. I found out that he was all naked and white. Just like the pharaoh in the pyramid sleeps in its golden coffin, both dignified and solemn, Tom's fingers rubbed his skin, the stiffness and The coldness made him unable to stop shaking. "Look at the salary," he repeatedly cheered for himself: "It’s just a dead person in the salary, it’s no big deal. God..." According to the regulations, he can’t Don't go on, although the fingers are shaking, the heart can almost jump out of the throat at any time - he has been touching the other's ankles, making sure that he is not able to feel the beating of the blood vessels in the neck of the body, underarms, and at the base of the thighs. - in the big thumb On the toe, the signboard of the corpse, with the number, weight and height, and some features, Tom carefully compared it. "Yes, that's it." He said, eagerly pulled up. The zipper completely separates the preservatives and the cold, peculiar smell of the corpse, and then waved to the guys in white clothes – move it away! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two veterans behind him laughed awkwardly. "It's not bad." One of the guards came slowly and patted the new man's generous and bearish back: "But you have to learn to control your embarrassment earlier. We often have this kind of "goods" here." He shrugged his shoulders: "In fact, I always think that the electric baton is much better than the finger. Just look at the ass, press the switch, as long as he has a tone, he can scream and jump, and It’s quick and simple. Those who “inside” disagree, they think that current will destroy these important medical tools. Really,” he lowered his voice: “This test always makes us feel like we’re going to Become a corpse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
