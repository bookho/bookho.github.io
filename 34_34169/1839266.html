			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s really a joy," Ivan laughed, his voice loud and dull, like a thunder from the eyes of a blind man, he Open your hands and make an exaggerated welcome gesture: "Brave lady, very brave. Please sit down... Thank you very much. Then," he looked at the boy: "There is still a seat, who is coming?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine heard the "very grateful", her face could not help but white, she vaguely felt that she had done something wrong again - but she did not have time I thought more, Besib and Sasha loosened each other's little fingers, and Sasha blinked at Besib and went to his father. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No!" Catherine shouted: "Wait a minute... wait."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I Wan Hao had a sharp chin and spread the palm of his hand. The radiant eyes like a crocodile showed a cold and stubborn look: "What's the problem? Dear," he pointed to himself: "One," Then there is the black and dark female companion around me, "two, three," and then pointing to Hopkins and his son and Catherine: "One, two, three, one shot per person, very fair." He paused. The finger clicked on the air: "Oh," he said suddenly and suddenly realized: "Maybe you mean identity?" Catherine certainly does not mean this, she wants to say that Sasha Hopkins is not yet adult. He shouldn't be involved in this cruel game, but Besib. Bissau, who is standing next to Hopkins, is also underage. Catherine doesn't like Besib, but she can't say anything. - Let Besib replace Sasha to die, he is a disgusting bad boy, a futuristic mob, unfinished Criminals, at least now he can still innocent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't worry," Ivan said. "I swear that I didn't let a little punk or a squatting scorpion. In the gambling game - the beautiful lady, the one sitting next to me is you... what is called, oh. The object that the agency is looking for, like you, an actor, your goal, He smiled smugly: 'I think my identity, can still be compared with Mr. Hopkins, maybe even focus? You see? As for this beautiful and lovely child, Mr. Hopkins, You have a good son. I also have a good daughter," he grabbed the yellow-haired girl's neck and forced her to her side. The intimate face pressed against her face: "Do you think we are like? A little, or a lot?" Her mother said this, a few years ago, when she brought this little monkey to me, she said that she was exactly the same as me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins noticed that the face of the gambling manager had become a bit strange for a moment. He looked through the information given by the red hair Judah in his mind - the blue shoulder Ivan used to enjoy when he gambled in Paradise Palace. The tortured object is indeed based on the free pimple provided by Paradise Palace. But the two women he brought were not pure furnishings. Whether it was yellow hair or black hair, they had been treated by Dr. Heaven Palace doctors - of course, not a cold or dermatitis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I feel like people like us don't want to have offspring," Ivan said. "It's too much trouble, too disgusting. But I am a magnanimous Man. I took this little bitch and raised her for three years.” He suddenly pushed the woman away and said it correctly. Girl, she almost fell off the stool, she did not react to Ivan's words, the expression on her face was mild and numb. Ivan did not give her a look, and extended two fat palms. I patted it on the greeny table: "Okay! I think we have wasted enough time, dear Mr. Hopkins. Let's get started - I will announce the bet - a shot per person But if you want, you can pay for the bullet, a bullet of 50 million."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accountant opened his mouth, he did not know Should I announce this bet loudly – ​​the gambler onlookers has almost been cleaned up, and here are all smart people. When I find that the atmosphere is not good, few people will come back again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The supervisor has to be calmer and calmer than the bookkeeper: "I'm sorry," he said to Ivan. "I really want to ask you." Is this a high stake?" This is a euphemistic question, because Ivan doesn't even have a banknote or a stack of chips. He must come up with a bet equal to Hopkins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivan sniffed his nose, "Vodka." He said, "Yes, 200 million," he used the barrel of the revolver to point the opposite side of the table. Four people: "50 million people per person, four people, a total of 200 million. Do you recognize this price? It doesn't matter, you have to think which is not worth it, feel free to tell me."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think the price given by Mr. Ivan Sergeyevich is still reasonable." Hopkins said, "Please give me a call."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The phone was quickly brought in, the bank’s action was fast, and after verifying the password and identity, a 200 million payment was transferred to Ivan’s account. At that time, Ivan had not even been able to drink a vodka. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Starting with me." Ivan said that he took the gun and held his temples without any mud. The thick fingers were tucked into the trigger hole. He pressed the trigger without any effort. People heard " A bang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivan’s eyes widened. He put down his gun, picked up the glass and drank a big bit: “Lucky.”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Next." Ivan handed the gun to the black-haired female companion, sweat came out of her hair, gathered in the forehead and cheeks, and then along the contour of the face Downstream, gathered in the neck and lower jaw, she is not used to using a gun, let alone holding a gun at her head - this is probably no one can get used to it, she barely lifted her gun after grinding for a few minutes, right Have your own head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I suggest you put your muzzle in your mouth, like Hemingway," Hopkins said with tenderness in kindness: "If the muzzle It’s very likely that you will only get rid of the skull or a part of your cheeks. The facial nerves are very dense. Dear, you will hurt very much, and you don’t want to die in a short time.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black-haired female companion, that is, the abilities who cast an angry and disdainful slap to everyone, pulled the trigger, the gun body shook violently, the muzzle shifted its position, if the bullet In the right place, her end may be as miserable as Hopkins predicted - but fortunately, she did not draw the deadly spades (in the playing cards, the spades represent death) ). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gun of the walnut handle fell from her hand, and Ivan caught it dexterously and in time: "It’s your turn," he said. : "May you be lucky."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silver weapons slid to Hopkins, Catherine grabbed it first, and she took it I fired a gun, pressed against the temple, and pulled the trigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gun didn’t ring, Catherine’s fingers moved, and Hopkins immediately raised his hand and gently removed the gun: “One shot, We have to obey the rules."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivan smiled happily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hop Hopkins took the gun and shot himself in a careless manner. The silver python was still silent, hiding its poisonous teeth. Well done. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
