			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This mobile circus name is not known, but its time of appearance is very appropriate and timely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third Tuesday of July is the martyrdom day of the town’s main saint St. John’s, and all the town’s residents will attend the big for him. Mass, the Holy Communion, and a few children will complete their “firm beliefs” in this mass, then a three-day, three-night celebration, of course, in this town with strict conservativeism. There will be no unrestrained feasts or too much arrogance and forgetting, indecent performances and dances, so the only thing that can be used as extra entertainment is to watch some old movies with a small projector installed in the small auditorium of the school. This has always been the case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, from the circus that was introduced a week ago, and the circus that the circus made when entering the town on Monday - the horn and the accordion, Bongo and flute, elephant, a young girl in a gemstone tights riding on an elephant (for the eyes of a small town resident, wearing a black long-sleeved high-necked collar in her tight-fitting tights), looks ugly tall Camels, zebras with black and white stripes, lions in the iron cages, violent lions, tigers, clowns on the ball, little poodles, monkeys and widows waving around the balls The dog singer, the soft body acrobat who twisted the whole body on the float... all got a huge, warm welcome is not so strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The children’s discussion of the circus was particularly enthusiastic. Mrs. Alan’s younger son came over and discussed with Sasha almost every day until Mrs. Alan’s constant urging and Shouting is only going back to school - the Sunday School is a converted stone-built castle. According to the rules that it was created, all students must stay in it, even if their home is only distance The school is less than ten feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sassassed a sigh of relief, never experienced it personally, you absolutely can't imagine a boy who would have an 80-year-old woman who would have the skill to fight back and forth. Repeated twenty-one camel's nose, thirty-four elephant's eyes, eight monkey's nose and at least fifty times the lion's bloody mouth and claws how to catch the iron fence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stairs creaked, the door to the attic was pushed open, and Catherine’s sloppy golden head emerged from the stepping board at the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha cast a questioning look, Catherine looked a little uneasy: "Mrs. Alan needs me to look at the store," she hesitated and said: "So I think I can't take you to the circus." The speed of speech is fast, and the eyes of pure sky are constantly looking around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha stared at her for a moment: "It doesn't matter," he shrugged and opened the book on his knees: "I didn't really like the circus." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine didn't relax immediately, she leaned over her shoulders, held her hands on the threshold, stared at the sand for a while, and finally spit out a helplessness. Long gas: "There is always a chance in the future." She smiled reluctantly, climbed up and walked into the room, kissed Sasha's little head, her lips and fingers were cold and terrible - her heart fell It is not difficult to guess, Sasha thought, he believed that Ariawu's "docile" Mori and the crocodile had left a very deep impression on his aunt. In this case, she did not let herself approach the beasts. In order to avoid any "emergency"; especially since I left Ariau, I have never mentioned my father, or have to leave - she must think that she is thinking about the law all the time. Things are good to take the opportunity to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, at least for now, he hasn’t moved his thinking to this direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine hasn't noticed until now that the town is actually quite interesting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the circus’s coming and performances are expected and many people are looking forward to But before that, the mass is the real highlight and the top priority. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of masses exceeds that of the circus, and in the eyes of Sasha, the long skirts and hats that are still used by people who have been wearing the last century are so solemn. Men and women, there are about ten people who want to hold a conviction, young girls in white, and the cross held by the priest in the hands of the priests, and the fun of the singer sings along the way is far better than the fun. Elephants and monkeys. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Guardian finished the verse and began to retell the great deeds of the saint John St. John. He used Latin, and despite the constant mistakes, Sasha was barely able to Understand, um, a pretty... meaningful story. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up and cried a Catherine, who was clutching his hand and walked forward. She had a white lace-up bonnet and her hair was wrapped in it. The black scarf on the outside, the white turtleneck shirt is covered with a dark brown long skirt, the feet are flat-heeled shoes with the same color as the headscarf, no makeup on the face, no nail polish on the fingers, except for a symbol of widowhood. Black iron refers to the whole body without ornaments, but whether it is a face or an expression, it is full of the serenity and tranquility that makes people laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She seems to have lived here for a hundred and eighty years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha does not know whether he should translate the sacred deeds he heard and repeat it to Catherine... The great St. John is a mercenary leader, he is in God. The purpose of saving the town that was threatened by the robbers and the enemy, the town residents were very grateful to him, but they searched the whole town and failed to find the property that could match this credit. Some suggested that: "Let us kill him, and then he will be the master saint of the town." All the townspeople, after discussion and voting, felt that the idea was very good, so they did it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Catherine likes this town, which was confirmed by Sasha long ago, although what she can get here is only heavy work and meager Income, as well as those that make Sasha very uncomfortable, full of assessments and whispers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She seems to use this as a clear and pure spring that can simultaneously elute the body and soul. Oh, maybe even the past that can't wait to be abandoned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha looked at the saint puppet who was carried on the shoulders of the people and decorated like an angel Gabriel, dressed in a Chinese costume and holding a sword. He thought that the great St. John would not like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people sang hymns, the mighty, happily carrying the cross and St. John’s walk around the town until those who participated in the conviction The children were exposed to the painful color because of the fatigue, and they walked into the church after the footsteps. Everything in the church was ready, the linen on the icon had been uncovered, and the linen on the altar was The golden candle glows on the white candle, and the incense in the fragrant boat has been lit up, warm and sweet, and the sweet scent fills the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole mass cannot be said to be as formal as the Roman Angels Cathedral, or it can be said to be second to none in this parish, Sasha and Catherine are arranged in In the last row of seats, Mrs. Alan and Sergeant Aaron were next to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
