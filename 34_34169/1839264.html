			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishb quickly calculated his mind, plus the original 10 million gambling, Ivan has won 50 million in succession. Up and down capital, while Hopkins's stakes are around 15 million. On the surface, Ivan, the "blue shoulder", has a big advantage, but in essence, it is just one or two bets - if the dealer's bet is still 10 million or more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bookkeeper raised his hand: "100,000."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The onlookers are involuntarily There was a strange look in their eyes. In their eyes, Ivan Sergeyevich, who did not hesitate to pull the bet to the minimum amount, because of a loss, couldn’t be courageous. He still had a lot of chips. And cash, right in the middle of the green gambling table, he does not have to be so conservative - directly affects the excitement of the show, several guys hidden in the crowd whistling whistling. Ivan Sergeyevich is indifferent to this performance. His elbow is on the edge of the gambling table. It is as short as a toy robot. The pale fingers are crossed, the thumb is up, and the bookkeeper is licensed. At the end, he first turned his cards and then watched the bookkeeper turn over Hopkins's cards - I don't know why, this time the bet is small, but still only Hopkins is a side house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The bookmaker six o'clock," the bookkeeper announced in a straightforward, faint tone: "Beside the house, eight points, next home wins." Waving the pole and setting aside ten pure gold chips on the chip hill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next Ivan announced that the bet was high and low, but the highest was only one million. He and Hopkins each had a win or loss. Hopkins's winning face is relatively large, the reason why it is not comparable to Ivan, but also because the latter has previously caught too much oil in other side homes. Ivan lost after losing twice. The sixth time the bet was reduced to 100,000 and people began to whisper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, he wants to take off," Besib said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you say?" Catherine grabbed the railing in front of her, and the place where she repeatedly rubbed was rubbed with silk gloves as a mirror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ivan? Sergeyevich is not an idiot," Besib said. "I think he knows where Hopkins came from." Mr.’s true identity, most of today’s gambling is coming to Hopkins and Shaun Battier behind him – I think his original plan was to let Mr. Battier eat a Dumb loss - nothing can be more enjoyable than this, I mean, not only jumped out of the trap, but also managed to bury the trap people - the problem is..." He observed the people around Ivan: "The goddess of luck seems I didn't want to always sit next to him, noticed. He showed a very surprised expression when he lost the 10 million, just like seeing a fish lying on the plate jumping into the sea and leaving... After that, he has been tempted. He is not sure that he will win. On the contrary, if he does not reduce his bet in a timely manner, he is now likely to have lost."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ivan is a cautious person. After discovering that things are not under his control, he will brake in time." Sasha said: "He has won enough today."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The dealer is nine o'clock." The bookkeeper said that ten gold chips were returned to the pile of hills. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins doctors easily caught a glimpse of the rapid passing of Ivan’s eyes, he regretted that he did not invest more chips, short fingers Lifted up, Ivan first licked his lower eyelids and topped his own temple. He turned his neck and let the bones out of Gragra's voice. He seemed to have lost interest in the gambling. But there are still three pairs of washed cards. He has to play the three decks at least, otherwise no one will ever be willing to sit on the table of the dealer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ivan stretched out a finger, and the waiter around him immediately leaned down and listened to him, very quickly. He brought a plate of spicy fried squid and a large cup of clear liquid, and Hopkins's sharp nose opened slightly. He smelled a soft creamy scent and an authentic vanilla flavor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a veteran gambler, Ivan certainly does not let alcohol numb his brain and nerves during the gambling process, and "Tianqiu" spicy oil Deep-fried squid is a special kind of snack. It can't be eaten immediately when it is in front of the guests. You have to wait for five or six minutes, waiting for the lemon sauce poured on the squid to penetrate into the fish thoroughly. - But you can't let it go too long, and after a few minutes, the cold squid will become soft and tough, and it's not good at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, Ivan is a quick fix, Hopkins can imagine that he will continue to cast the minimum amount in the next three cards. The bet, winning is good, and losing has nothing to do with it. He just waited to end the game. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the bookkeeper once again issued a card, Hopkins reached out his fingers, his fingers were much longer than Ivan, and also There is no heavy hair, and it is like a plaster or marble painting model placed on the green furry table. The dark gold underside playing cards are quietly lying in the middle of his wrist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there any problem?" Ivan said: "My hand?" Hopkins looked at his hand, not long, you can say He just let the line of sight stay on the ring for a while, but the ring on the finger can be said to be a very sensitive sign. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This ring makes me feel a bit familiar." Hopkins said, picking up his own card and looking at it: "I seem to have seen this style of ring more than a decade ago, it is also on the finger. He nodded to the bookkeeper: "Replenishment." Then he turned to Ivan: "Slightly different, the ring is four thorns - you see, your ring has only three thorns." Ivan's face suddenly was a bit uncomfortable. He refused to make up the cards. The bookkeeper opened the cards according to his request. Five points, Hopkins. It was six o'clock, Hopkins won, and Ivan seemed to wave his hand absently, indicating that the bookkeeper would start the next game as soon as possible: "Is it in Las Vegas?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where is it?" Hopkins slowly picked up ten tight chips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That should not be me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not for you, although that is also a northerner. Hopkins said: "At that time he was still a young boy, his beard and hair were soft, his eyes were brown, and there was a cross-shaped plaque on his forehead. He said it was the trace left by the angel after kissing. His lucky charm."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is better to say that it is the guiding target left by the devil." Ivan whispered: "He won from here. A big sum of money goes back..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have to say that the opposite is true. Compared to you, his luck is really bad." Hope Kings opened his own card. This time Ivan won, but Ivan’s mind seems to have disappeared from this: “Don’t he win the game with a smooth win, and almost let the casino close?” Ivan glanced at the glass of wine, and a large portion of the spicy fried squid had turned into a dark brown. He pinched it, put it in his mouth, and chewed it out loud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unless there is a second Mr. Niu in the world (Northern Saying. The cow is called Cloven)," the bookkeeper sent for Hopkins. A new card: "It's really a stubborn calf," Hopkins said in a pitiful tone: "He lost all his money. Tables, jewelry, and clothes, except wear On the body, when he walked out of the casino, he only had a bare bottom."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How much did he lose?" The deal was completed, but Ivan Not eager to see his cards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"1.7 million."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Impossible!" Ivan said: "He doesn't have that much money."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But he can charge," Hopkins said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ivan stares at Hopkins. His eyes are dark and flashing with unclear light: "You seem to know this very well, Mr. Hopkins."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is nothing strange. "Hopkins replied: "It is me who won him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Shawn Battier, who looked at the monitor screen, laughed and ate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accountant and the casino supervisor asked if Ivan Sergeyevich would go on the next game, Ivan Sergeyevich Hesitated for a moment, but still agreed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can I ask?" I don’t know when to return to the red hair around Shane Battier, Curious said: "Mr. Crovin is Who?” Like a significant person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A northerly." Battier said that his face still carries a strange smile that makes people feel cold: "You may be against him." Not very familiar, he has not entered Las Vegas for more than a decade - but maybe a few more years. You can see his name - on the 'we' list, he is at the top. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is the son of the current northern leader, a energetic, ambitious, thoughtful and troublesome character." Battier held out his little finger and licked it. Chin: "His father and Ivan Sergeyevich's father competed with the leader's seat, hehe. As a result, you can see that the Cloven family won, Ivan's father died, and he was also assigned. In the fringe, but in the past two years, the Ivan school has started to move again – so Kloin found him again and gave him this errand. This is a good job, dear, safe, not easy to go wrong. And you can also raise a lot of money with 'good luck'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kloin really lost to Hopkins?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
