			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aria, in the Amazon, the first forest hotel was originally a 6-story wooden tower built on high stakes, backed by the forest. Facing the river, the rainy season is like a water tower, and in the dry season it is like a castle in the air. After the expansion in 1994, it became a more authentic forest hotel with eight wooden towers. The largest tower is 7 stories high with more than 80 rooms. The sixth and seventh floors of each tower are deluxe suites, and the most luxurious suites occupy a whole floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the tower, the Ariau Hotel also has 9 sets of superior rooms scattered in the jungle, which are hidden from the outside in the huge canopy, as if directly Built on the same tree. Each superior room has multiple bedrooms and swimming pools for families with many children. The hotel also has a wireless broadband Internet computer and communication signal enhancement equipment, and the mobile phone conversation is very clear. Therefore, even if you are in the depths of the jungle, you must not worry about losing contact with the outside world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because many tourists are afraid of viper and do not dare to walk on the ground, Ariawu Hotel has also set up more than 10 kilometers of aerial elevated road bridges, most of which are asphalt On the pavement, only one or two kilometers is a wooden bridge. These tourism projects include boating on the forest, jungle walks, watching Wang Lian, fishing piranhas, catching crocodiles at night, visiting the "riverside" family and Linzhong fishing village and so on. Adventurous visitors can take part in adventure tours such as night camps and feeding puffer fish. Tourists accompany the tour when they travel, and the only means of transportation is the boat. Only the Ariau Hotel has 5 yachts, more than 10 motorboats and more than 20 motor boats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three k,...sorry, I won again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guards In the lounge, Joe happily dropped the cards and hand-picked out the pale greens from the chest pockets of several constantly cursing colleagues. The banknote with Mr. Andrew Jackson’s head came: "I really love these." Spicy baby! Oh, don't be so depressed, I invite you to drink beer tonight!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You damn miser! You are the most today At least we won two hundred dollars, but we only want to invite us to drink beer! Well, I have to take over!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the losers complained that they stood up I checked the gun in my waist and made it squeaky. The person next to me sneered: "Calm down, don't take the fire and kill Joe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "You idiot, be careful!" Joe snorted unnaturally: "Go to the succession, you have been late twice this month, and will be fired again!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young guard continued to complain, but he quickly reached the door. In Brazil, a well-paid job like the Ariawu Hotel Guard is not so easy to find. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened the door that was not strong enough, but unexpectedly saw the object of his succession standing in the door pale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Damn!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was shocked and he cursed loudly: "What? , Ram, what happened! Have you seen the ghost? Why didn’t you come back after the time to take over?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the people in the room stood They got up and pulled out their respective pistols. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The word tourism, depending on the destination, has a thousand meanings, some places are supernatural, some places are warm and romantic, some have a long history, there are Modern and modern... The story about Amazon is that it is a life of nine deaths. It is said that there are nine dangers lurking between the jungle and the water: crocodiles, poisonous snakes, poisonous insects, piranhas, infectious diseases, drug dealers, guerrillas and hijackers. You never Know what happens next minute. In particular, Ariau, a luxury hotel in the depths of the jungle, is both a paradise for the rich and a favorite place for the guerrillas. In order to continue this lucrative business, the owner of Ariawu gave the military a lot of benefits, so the hotel not only had different kinds of firearms, but even the guards, but also the characters who retired from the actual combat troops. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I really saw the devil!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ram grabbed his throat and said: "Do you still remember the little girl? Her father took What did she live in in the superior room of No. 6?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened to the little angel, did she come out like the pretty guest you provoked last time? Is the 10mm caliber 'Corte' aimed at your 'small head'?" Joe shouted impatiently: "I have warned you! As long as those damn guests did not make something similar to the hotel. Don't worry about selling things, even if they put their heads in the mouth of the crocodile? Aria's rent is paid!" He gave the young guard a look, the latter helplessly Shrugging and pulling Ram into the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are five minutes earlier today, Ram, you have to return it to me next time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;He said this, then walked out of the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give a glass of guarana to Ram! (Note 1) Count it on my account!" Joe patted Ram's shoulder with a wide palm: "Good. Sit down and say, Ram, don't be astonished like a big frog."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I, I saw the girl, she and da Together..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God, because of this thing, that sir? I already knew, 'This is Miri, my nanny. "" Joe vividly imitated the tone of the little girl, and the other people laughed. "No big deal, the snake is her nanny. For several years, her father assured us that it would not leave Room 6." he comforted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't understand, that's da! Not (蟒水)! da can't be domesticated by humans, it's only the devil! The devil, the devil They are the devil!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" OK," Joe said with a smile: "We know that you are not a coward, you are a little afraid of snakes, oh... ...a little bit." Joe leaned closer to Ram: "I suggest you go back and take a good rest, yes, take a break."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He straightens his body, Leaving the poor Ram, and walking out of the lounge, the moon on the Amazon River seems to be able to swallow this small tower. He looked at the moon for a long time and spit on his feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"××! I have to tell the boss that he has to change someone!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... ..............................<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I am going to sleep, go back... Hey," Sasha grabbed a Komori. The tail of the donkey, "I don't want to climb into my clothes. I won't be allowed to get into my blanket later. My father will see you will take you to make soup. Do you know the meaning of making soup?" The cute little girl tried to make a sly expression and said to the Mori group who almost drowned her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go, let's go, I will be here tomorrow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Underneath, the dark green, like the vine-like Mori slowly loosened the entanglement of each other, one by one, and returned to the dark jungle along the tower, although they did not want to leave this strange, warm creature... ...but there is a voice telling them that the order of this creature cannot be violated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
