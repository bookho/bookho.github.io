			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After six days, Jesus took Peter, Jacob, and Jacob's brother John, and went up to the mountains in secret. Just changed in front of them. The face is as bright as the sun, and the clothes are white as light. - Mark's Gospel<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is bright and silent, its speed is so fast, fast is like an idea - clouds, rocks, Trees, buildings and all kinds of creatures become clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The darkness leaves, dawn comes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether it is day or night, it is the window that always opens in the rain and snow, and naturally it cannot block the intrusion of thin mountain fog and icy air. A regular bell rang, it was the bell that called the people of Strange Jacobs to make the first public prayer. Stefan had not heard it for nearly two decades, but in childhood and youth. The habit of being forced to create still has some residuals, like the sharp small linen thorn in the collarless shirt stabbing his skin. He did not resist them, but obediently put down the pen in his hand and squatted in the wet. Slate on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When praying, he closed his eyes, fingers crossed and clenched his fists, his forehead pressed tightly against the backrest of the seat, describing the construction of St. Benedict The relief of St. Maldin's Church imprints a clear mark on his hot, cold skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stefan’s prayer was not as long and cumbersome as people thought, and he didn’t even wait to hear the end of the bell and stood up, his The Lord has heard his words and given his clear instructions as he did before. His eyes are clear and his mind is clear. He knows what he has done before, knows what he is doing now and -- doing something in the future. what. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He returned to the desk and wrote the letter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will go directly to the Prime Minister’s deacon, the first assistant bishop of the hall, which is often referred to as the “black bishop”, in the hands of Rattle Blue. The letter may be a big surprise, and it must also include the usual sense of the teacher, the shepherd and the guide of Stefan. His baptismal priest Romero, now the bishop of the Holy Land of St. Luke, is very likely to be the assistant bishop of the future provincial archbishop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun came in from the only window in the room, illuminating Stefan’s fingers, a little bit of mineral ink on the little finger’s belly, peacock in the sun Feathery blue-green. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest did not notice, or noticed, but was temporarily not interested in paying attention to this small problem. He stood in front of the window, where he could overlook the east side of the huge mansion and part of the north and south sides. The courtyard was empty. . Yes, now Strangya is still doing morning prayers - in addition to the usual singing of hymns, day classes and prayers, but also listening to the "sage" Jared's guiding speech. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the morning air is too cold. So these words filled with mystery, horror and threats (actually just a mixture of ridiculous delusions, a few words in the Bible, and a few ambiguous tremors) were recorded before dinner the day before. Jared has a dedicated recording studio and two full-time staff members responsible for this work, and Jared is forced to allow the latter two to take a short period of professional guidance in the world of the devil, he is very happy The two brothers did not fall in the uncontrollable time of the "sage", after several years of close surveillance and careful estimation. Jared generously awarded them the title of "elder". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the illness worsened, Jared, who hasn’t recorded a new song for more than a year, has a huge headset and listens to his voice with satisfaction. Hong Liang, how clear, it is like ringing the morning bell of heaven in the chest - as before, he likes to listen before everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not available that night. Because the recording has to be dealt with, with the vast sacred background music, the noise and broken sound are repaired. In some places, speed up or slow down, increase the echo, make them sound like a person is talking, but an angel or even a god is calling or singing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the morning prayer, it was the time when Stronga received the instructions. The sound engineer did not give up the right to early prayer, so they must start earlier than anyone in order to arrange everything. Sometimes it has to be wanted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Stefan’s “return”, only the sage Jared can pray in his prayer room, which used to be his own privilege. Stefan’s sorrow made the sage angry, but the time passed, and now Stefan is not the little boy who is crying and arrogant. He has strength, has his own ideas and ideas, and has rights – not just It was given by the Supervisory Board. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A long-awaited grey geese came in through the window, and Stefan tied the letter enclosed in a small metal tube to his feet, gray The geese quietly licked the feathers and jumped out of the window in a quirky posture. It could be said to have fallen a short time, but as it is estimated, a warm airflow lifted it up,<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although not the first time," said the Pope, "but I still have to say, dear Rattle Blue, this is really wonderful." Extreme." He was sitting in the warm garden, the sun was shining, then suddenly a gray geese fell, it seemed to want to land on his knees, but the place was too small, and finally it had to retreat It broke into a fountain a few feet from the Pope. At the age of 72, St. Paul XVI, who looks like an ordinary but cute little man, became wet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...but I think, squat, or I should ask him to change the way of communication." Rattle Blue said, wiping with a large dry towel The Pope is as white and soft as the sheep's hair and a beard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why, I think this is very interesting. Child, I am old, need a little surprise."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "But I and your guards were frightened!" Rattle said, "It’s dangerous because they don’t know if they should lay a bird that is clearly directed at you. They can carry There are too many things, in addition to letters, there are many, such as micro-liquid explosives, or Bacillus anthracis - even for safety, I think that an e-mail that may be intercepted is better than one. The birds that will be hit by poachers or curious children are good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope licked his head and revealed a mischievous smile:" But the problem is, let him do this, it’s not someone else, it’s me.” Then he wisely added before the thick assistant eyebrows of the first assistant bishop in the main hall: “Of course, I will be in the next one. The letter tells him that he doesn't have to go any more - he can write to me in other ways, like Say. My r (microblogging)."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am telling you, Your Majesty, your other..." The first assistant bishop was not easy Swallow the words "Ideas": "The idea was supported. An hour ago, the religious court has already made a ruling. Focusing on your social media account or your official website can make the believers get a big fight - especially needed The point is that they must be your followers, rather than letting the birds fly away." (Note: meaning is the message on r, but also has the meaning of barking)<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good description, dear Rattle Blue." The Pope stroked the gray geese who had only been lucky on his noble knees. Its feathers are very dry, and the place is warm, plus thousands of kilometers have been flying before. So it closed his eyes and fell asleep. The Pope bowed his head and lowered his voice. "I think I might be able to add a small speech after the mass of the day after tomorrow - a small urge."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Is there your social media?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“No, not just these.” The Pope felt the warm little guy, it was in his arms. The sweetness of sleep, the stomach with the breath together, his fingers on its wings, smooth feathers in the sun a circle of small ripples, life is always worthy of awe. He thought, "I hope they can use all, whether in the traditional way - confession. Spread doctrines and oral scriptures, books, pictures, or those less traditional - video, animation, blogs, WeChat, Websites...etc., as long as people can hear and see. Rattle Blue, although I know that the process must be difficult and rugged - at the beginning, it will be overwhelming, embarrassing and even angry - I know that there are still people who think that the Internet and mobile phones are the creation of the devil."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The children are always impatient. They need and want to receive There are too many things, so they can't really understand and be familiar with them. They can't even sit quietly and have a meal. But we can't just shrug our shoulders and watch them slide over the abyss. The speed is like that. Fast - this is not a reason," he continued peacefully. "It is not a reason. As a shepherd, guiding the Lambs to the right path is their sole responsibility. If you fail to do so, there is no doubt. Jobs - even as the movie assumes, Satan directly slams his feet on the concrete floor of a hospital corridor, which is also our sin and can never be forgiven."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, the servants of God's servants fell into a short meditation. After about six or seven minutes, he looked up. "Tomorrow is Friday?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Your Majesty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can I have some squid custard?" The old man asked hopefully Road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...If you promised that you wouldn’t sneak into the kitchen and add too much cheese to the fish... I think it should be ok. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You must be temperate, wake up, because your enemies The devil, like a roaring lion, is looking for someone to swallow;" - 伯前5:8<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the current "sage" Jared is a passionate People with power, glory, and desire, even if they are close to each other, the meeting twice a day has never stopped. There are a total of 72 elders in Baiyan City, responsible for various affairs. They come in batches and in small rooms. Meeting with Jared alone, Jared cares about everything, no matter how big or small, and there is always only one person who can make a decision - himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
