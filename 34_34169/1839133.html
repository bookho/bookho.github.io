			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't understand what you are saying." Annie repeated, her face was more flat and stiffer than her last tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Streif stunned his head: "I have a friend, a friend who has a good relationship, he works in a semi-official department, that department The name may have been heard by you - agency, Anne, agency," he put his fingertips in front of his lips: "a place that is not very flattering, but it is undeniable that there is almost a quarter of it covered. The information of the earth - the feeling of his own, I can regularly enter their non-public website, see, I got these names from there, there are a few photos, it is a pity, can not show you now You will feel very familiar, isn't it? Fanta Wharton? Ah, it doesn't matter, you don't have to rush to deny it. As I said before, I am just a curious person, you have to listen to it. Da. Wharton's business? Listen, there is no harm."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fanta Wharton, when she first appeared in the agency's record Only seven years old, born in a middle and lower income class, father is electronic The staff of the garbage collection station, the mother is the housewife, Fanta is their only child, she is beautiful, gentle, clever, likable, teachers, neighbors, relatives all praise her, parents are proud of her She went to school at the age of six and took several prizes and medals for herself in the first year. It can be said that a perfect little princess - except for her extraordinary family and parents, they took out all of their own Savings and wages, but still not enough to buy her expensive ballet skirts and dance shoes, piano, violin, not enough for her to go to the international summer camp, travel camping, let alone go to the theater to participate in performances or participate in private tutoring classes... but Fortunately, she has an old and rich old aunt. Miss Wharton has no children, no husband, no temper, and has been living alone in another state. At the time of Fanta Wharton’s Christmas at the age of seven For the first time, she accepted the invitation of Fanta's parents. She met the child and liked the child... She hopes to adopt Fanta Wharton and promises to give Fanta's parents a big one. The money...but she was rejected with no mercy—these were written in a letter, and one wife sent it to another wife, full of complaints—she thought that the parents were not lifted. Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but she doesn’t have to be disappointed so early, the Wharton family is at Easter, that year should be April 22, and it’s a terrible In the fire, Mr. Wharton was seriously injured, Mrs. Wharton died, and their little daughter... she was safe and sound--because she was not at home...when her parents were taken to the hospital, she had already taken the trip to her aunt. The public coach of the state where she lived. She knocked on the door of the old aunt on the morning of Easter, and separated at noon. No one knew what happened. A neighbor found a poor old man at nine o'clock in the evening. The aunt fell under the stairs and her body was already stiff. She found Fanta Wharton on the fourth day. She stayed in a women's monastery. She said that she didn't know 'I don't know' about everything. Don't understand ', ie Someone pointed out that she saw her out of the residence of Miss Wharton, she still did not change her original intentions - for her parents' loss, she was indifferent, no matter where she looked, she could not find a trace of fear and sadness, and later welfare Institutional staff found around $400 in cash and Wharton credit cards in her backpack. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, Mr. Streif paused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne Kent closed his mouth and said nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Things are man-made, things are in the sky." Streif continued: "This is an oriental proverb, I think this makes sense, Fanta Wharton It’s not bad, but she’s obviously inexperienced – humans are always eager for something that’s hard to reach, and the things that are delivered to the door are shunned, a bad, irreparable common problem. Well, Fanta Wharton is at least After reaching a goal, she smashed the poor and ill-advised parents. After spending more than a month in the child welfare agency, her custody was transferred to a distant relative, where she changed her name to Angela Cluj. She, the name she used for a short time, because her adoptive parents' youngest child, a six-month-old baby with a comminuted skull fracture, hospitals and child welfare agencies suspected that this was because they were negligent and even abused. Suspected children - they checked other children and found the scars left behind by beatings in Angela Cruise and another child, although the latter child insisted that this was the result of Angela’s fight with herself. ...... But Angela provided a counter-evidence, and people took the latter testimony. Two of the still-lived children of the Cruise family were sent to the child welfare agency, and their parents were jailed... Angela Cruise After a few months, I was adopted again. The adopter is the Rapp couple. They are older, have no children, and want a little girl with one heart and one mind. They have been preparing for a long time and have applied for many times. This time they finally got their wish, so Angela. Cruise became Lili Rapp again. She stayed at the Lapp family for more than a year. When everyone thought that all three people would welcome their own happiness, the Rapps met again and again, I don’t know. For what, they took too much sleeping pills and couldn’t sleep... So Lily Rapp returned to the Children’s Welfare Institute for the third time, where she was examined and treated by a child psychologist for four months. Later, the latter announced that the former had been restored because of the sudden death of the adoptive parents, and became the latest adoptive father of Lili Rapp. He gave the little girl a new name, Nina.gp. In the month, he was stabbed by his new adoptive woman—the knife was really clean and beautiful, and it was like a veteran from Sicily.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The animal that was made was a pimp!” Anne Kent blurted out and bit her lip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Streif patted the palm of his hand gracefully: "My dear Anne Kent," he asked with a sigh of relief: "You still insist on it now." Are you just thinking about a harmless little adventure here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie twisted her lips, revealing a mature sneer, lifting her chin: "I don't know what you are talking about, I just come to play, and you are instructing your dog to attack me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fanta Wharton is expensive." The doctor's slender fingers crossed the Arabic number "6" in Greek, which is a "vi". "The amount of her reward has reached six million yuan. Among them, 700,000 yuan came from her distant relatives, the Cruz couple. As a lesser-spirited party, Mrs. Cruise was released on parole one year later, and she tried to find herself. Children, but one of them has been taken to Canberra by the adoptive parents, the other died in an accident at the child welfare agency... They have lost their children forever, and the Cruises decided to take the house, stock and car, etc. In short, all the more valuable things were sold, in exchange for a total of 700,000 yuan, to repay Fanta Wharton to the institution, regardless of the life and death; the other 300,000 paid by the Rapp’s nephew, he inherited The heritage of the couple It is not an accident to insist that their death; Mr. Gp proposed a million yuan, if it is a live Fanta Wharton, and can hand it to his hand, he is willing to increase 500,000."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne Kent waited, but this time Mr. Streif closed his mouth: "Who else?" Anne Kent asked: "You said that there are six million yuan. So, at least there are 3.5 million who are there, who is that? Which bastard?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Exchange it," Mr. Streif Say: "Let us meet each other's curiosity, tell me, Anne Kent, starting with Fanta Wharton."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...the old lady I want to adopt Fanta Wharton," Anne Wharton hesitated for a moment, then replied with a pleasant reply: "This is a good thing, Fanta Wharton can get better, and her parents can get it." A lot of money, they can regenerate a child. But they just don't want to."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ms. Wharton, she is a rebellious, saying The unbelievable old guy, obviously she said, 'If you don’t have parents, I can adopt you.' It’s obviously what she said, but she can call her if she is there. She is not willing to adopt Fanta Wharton. Also, she is a little hybrid possessed by the devil."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And Cruise, Cruise, you can imagine, just earn income, A four-room apartment, a small scary Japanese official car, three children, three children! So they want to adopt a fourth, they can't even provide a separate room! ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
