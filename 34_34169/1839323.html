"You almost killed him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry." Sasha said that he knew his behavior was abrupt and extremely risky, Lila’s ability to him I have seen it for myself, and Dr. Hopkins has also analyzed for him. Lila’s ability is quite promising – although it seems to be suitable for magic – floating and penetrating, but At all, her ability should be to change itself and the structure of the material that it can reach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly adding a person - Lila is likely to miss Charlie in the floor of the baptismal hall by miscalculating the strength she needs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability of the action group member "Abel" in the organization is similar to that of Lila, but his ability is not intended for "Ghoul", more accurate Point out, "Ghoul" thinks that he is at the wrong use of the ability to use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In exchange for organic matter with life and soul for inorganic matter--" Dr. Hopkins said: "Yes, it looks beautiful, some say, As long as he can provide him with enough living things, he can exchange for endless precious materials, steel, gold, bismuth, bismuth, red silicon borosilicate, peptide phenanthrene, bismuth... can it? In theory, it seems, but Let's see, can he really do it? No, the trader who hides behind Abel's ability is an out-and-out, old-fashioned and stupid miser - 'it' is calculating the converted object. At the time, never accumulate, and never take anything other than energy into consideration.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You give him a million mice, he only once Can you redeem one, change one rubber ball at a time? Do you need one million rubber balls? What can one change in one's life? A pistol, a shield? A crystal sculpture? Or a set of stainless steel Kitchenware? Of course, you can also give him a third of blacks or Jews, that He may be able to open a very good supermarket chain?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or give him a blue whale? How many grams do you think he can change? How many blue whales are there?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
