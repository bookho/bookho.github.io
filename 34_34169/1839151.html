			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If we want to do something, then we must be in front of the hurricane," under the bright white light, the man in a gray coat A projection screen with a large wall turned around and said, the outline of the island, the terrain, the surrounding waters and the island's buildings - restaurants, workers' quarters, tools and storage rooms, cellars (depicted by dotted lines and shadows) More than half of it is mapped between his chest and the lower abdomen, not far from the island, and the reef that protrudes from the sea forms a mossy green spot on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, no doubt." Another person whispered: "The devil testified, we really should do something." He used impatiently The platform boots are beaten by a famous dance on the smooth ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ginger-colored eyes are as arrogant as the vultures overlooking everyone in the room - he is a tall, burly warrior with about four points One of the black bloodlines, the refractory combat suit is covered with the latest in-use interceptor body armor, which is in addition to the original front and side ballistic protection inserts, but also in the deltoid, ankle, groin and throat. The addition of protective modules, which are hidden under the dark, ballistic fabric, such as the Gothic body armor of the fifteenth century, are raised in a block--the wearer becomes more courageous Even a bit horrible, when it is still, it is like a granite statue used to commemorate the world war. When moving, it is reminiscent of the adult Kodiak brown bear (three meters high when people stand up). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you have any opinion on my plan?" The gray jacket accurately grasped the voice and the owner of the sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strong mixed-blooded bored open his hands: "No, sir," he said. "The plan sounds perfect, and there are instructions on it. He said sincerely: "This action swat (the special equipment and tactical squad) has to listen to hrsf (_FBI hostage rescue team), yes, yes, I am very clear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But if you have any ideas or suggestions...Speak it out and say it right away." The gray coat said harshly: "Now is not the time to play tricks or passive absenteeism. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I know this is not good, it is very bad, the person in charge of the new York swat still has an uncontrollable emotion uncontrollably - oh, that group of quail eggs Plus low-ranking bureaucrats, what do they think is the action group? Can you add ingredients to the dishes at any time? Hey, man, my pizza needs to add one more cheese - hey, man, we think you need some support! Hey, we found a new boss for you; hey, do you have any thoughts? Oh, your mood is not right! Hey, you may need to go back to school to study! God's broken! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He held out a finger and scratched his neck: "The snake can't have two heads," he snorted. "I don't have the right to set it up, whether it's an action plan or something else, although I do have a problem. - Well, you are sure of our intelligence...no problem?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;armed forces, combat terrain, firepower configuration, hostage status, on-site intelligence, suspects\ The evaluation of the psychological quality of the hostages - they got information about the ealf organization and several suspects, not enough, the radical animal protection organization is very loose, the contact between people is almost by email and phone, they just Like a group of ubiquitous mosquitoes, hey, people are puzzling, when they want to move the real thing, they will sneak away, no, you can’t catch them, you can’t catch their handles and Tail - Even if they did go too far this time, the police still can't clearly identify which people are involved, not to mention their identity, composition and possible weapons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kaijia provides the plane and structure of the island building, New York City has found the island, the island's adjacent waters and traffic details, but no one can know the island What is the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the negotiation, ealf allowed one (only one) of the people they designated to go to the island to confirm the hostage situation, an old Chinese, although he also has eyes, Nose and ears, but an ordinary person who has never had any training can get something worthy of use from this short ten minutes? He couldn't even tell the assault shotgun and the automatic rifle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the hrsf team used an incredible way to make swat - they invited a psychic, yes, a psychic, though he was like An ordinary person, but he claims to be able to attach some of his senses to others - he can see every detail that others see, hear every voice heard by others, and understand every feeling that others receive. . He attached to the Chinese, went to the island, and brought back a lot of information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the composition, orientation, mood of the ealf members to the position and physical condition of the hostage, as well as the weapons used by the criminals, the means of imprisonment and disguised as a suitcase bomb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grey jacket didn’t talk, he lowered his head and pressed his glasses. “This time the source of the information is really special,” he looked up, his brown eyes. Straight to the corner of the room: "But I can guarantee that we can trust them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man sitting in the corner heard the words and gently lifted his lips. He opened a cigarette case and grabbed the candy from the inside and stuffed it into his mouth. The rich sweet smell could be heard by special action personnel standing outside the house. What a childish move and hobby, but he picks up like a well-trained Wall Street person, as long as he puts a leather briefcase in his arms to send him to any stock exchange or financial institution. Go to work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pandora's Box, which was opened by ghouls and his children, has caused many people's misfortunes, including those in the largest hospitals in the organization, that is, " In the Tower of Babel, he became the "head" of the top leader. He was seriously derelict. He was picked up by the upper class of the organization and kicked into the action group. This is nothing. He did it a decade ago. He is confident to climb up again, as long as he can build enough credit to get the little birds that escaped from the cage one after another. Perhaps not enough, but this is definitely one of the necessary ways. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person in charge of swat sniffed, "I hope so." He said that if there is more time and the weather is not so bad, maybe he will stick to it. Other more reliable methods to obtain, at the very least, verify intelligence, but the current situation is no longer allowed to delay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is the negotiation?" In general, such incidents are best solved with silver bullets instead of bullets, and negotiators will work hard until the last minute. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They refused to negotiate." Gray coat replied: "This is one of the important reasons why we must put the rescue plan on the table."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that we only have to do it," said the head of the swift swinging his elbows up and down to make a gesture of "hurry". "How much time do we have?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not more than an hour," the gray coat raised his wrist and looked at his watch: "May 16 minutes, maybe longer, those Chinese promised to meet ealf The request has been put into action, this is the first request of ealf, but I don't think it will be the last one. The last time the guy made eleven requests."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The golden shark fins were removed from the sealed glass showcase and warehouse, and the ealf volunteers were ready for enough gasoline , firewood and burning places, they piled up these expensive and even priceless ingredients, and then ignited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The golden red flame gradually flourished, the smelly smell and the black smog filled the dark gray world. The wind was very strong. Mars was like a small fish, followed by a string, and swam quickly around people. Going around in an attempt to ignite hair and clothing, volunteers have to step back and step by step, some of them applauding. Several other people turned on the computer and directed the camera at the burning site for live broadcast, which was a requirement of ealf members. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of Kai and Xu are also on the scene, and their losses are the most serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several women couldn’t help but cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kai Yongping tightly held the mother’s arm and bear the weight of most of her body – the two of the biggest Tianji wings are her dowry . “This is nothing to do,” he said indifferently. “In the factories of Germany, Spain, Portugal, Northern Europe and North America, the shark liver was refined into cod liver oil, shark liver alcohol, shark skin was made into leather goods, and cartilage was made. Osteogenic powder, the market publicly sells the entire shark meat, every household in Sri Lanka will use salted shark meat to make meat chop, Canadian fishermen catch a lot of dog sharks every year - they take off the meat and sell shark fins to us - here People eat bears, bison, deer, goats, grouse, salmon, and thousands of wild scorpions and horses are killed every year to make dog food cat food. The hard-to-count animal skin is peeled off. Into the clothes, but who cares about these? This is their tradition, rules and customs." He shook his head slightly: "We are condemned, hated, degraded, just because we prefer part of the shark instead of All - but our traditions, rules and customs? No one cares, no one wants to know, no matter how many years we have been here - we don't belong here, here It doesn't belong to us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't have to be sad." He lowered his head and put his lips close to his mother's ear: "Traditional is not so easy to die." He even A smile appeared: "The shark has not been completely extinct - we can always get it back - the mother, there is a saying that is good, under the reward, there must be a brave man."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(To be continued)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorry, sorry, the recent work is too tight, and when I came back, I could barely get up with my waist. Half-month work overtime without a rest day, even the axis turns - is this really a day of people? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One day, the leader asked me innocently: "Why don't you like to work overtime?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;</div>
