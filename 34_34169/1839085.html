Single bottom, single deck, horizontal frame structure, equipped with imported outboard machine, the operation is extremely flexible... Do you really need a driver? Gently patted the ship's side and looked at the guests in front of him. He carried the light, and the beautiful sunset of Amazon outlined the bright outline of the thin and tall body, just like the colorful mosaic glass icon in the church. On one shoulder, one of the biggest Mori he had ever seen, while the other was occupied by a little girl wrapped in a soft wool cloak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, thank you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guest replied briefly, then extended his left hand to the foot On the side of the ship, Mori looked at the field not far from the laziness. He put his head on the empty deck and squirmed the belly that was still full of fat. He was tempered like a man for a while. I climbed into the back seat as beautiful and comfortable as a luxury car. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a big guy, isn’t it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The administrator said to himself, Watching the guests carefully put the little girl on the side of Mori, although Joe repeatedly said that he would not give any advice on the behavior of this guest, but he could not help but open his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Are you sure you want to go with your child? The night is the time of the giant spider activity."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the jungle in the night is much more terrible than the giant spider, but he thinks it's best not to mention too much things that even make adults scream and wake up in a nightmare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guest stared at him quietly for a few seconds, and when the administrator thought he had changed his mind, he smiled very softly and said: Thank you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;........................<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The engine of the yacht is low The roar, steadily through the silent waterway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the light is dim, Hopkins still sees the very fresh white wounds of the vines and trees that are entangled in the waterways. This is the place where the hotel often takes guests to explore and fish. The obstacles below and above the waterway, whether it is underwater decaying roots or plants on the water, will be cleared regularly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black skull of the triangle has been placed on the knees of the sand, and the pink tongue is spit out, and the familiar particles of moisture are shrinking on the tongue. When you go back, it rushes into its sensory nerve along its nose aid (a pair of small cavities in front of the mouth, composed of sensory cells), a smell that is completely different from the substances that humans like to use, such as cement and paint. Let it be excited, especially when a big frog that is single is swam in the water, not far away, its muscles suddenly become tense and raise their heads high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not here, it knows that your home is deeper and darker than here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the night falls, the waterways are getting wider and wider, and when Anthony sees a large piece of Amazon water lily that climbs to cover almost a few miles, they The large flower, one foot in diameter, has been completely closed. The flowering period of this kind of water lily is extremely short. It blooms in the evening and emits a scent. When it is night, the flowers are closed. The next day, it is still not open, and slowly turns into pink. It opens again the next evening. This time, it is closed. It will not be opened anymore. Because this can avoid auto-pollination. The aroma that emanates on the first night attracts insects, which bring pollen from other water lily, so the flower is about to be fertilized; but after the lotus closes the petals, the insects are kept in the flower for 24 hours. The next night, the beautiful prison opened the door again, and the prisoners left on their own – the insects were covered in pollen while they were staying in the flowers. At the same time, the flower turns into a gorgeous red, and the aroma is gradually dissipated. It no longer has any attraction for insects, so the insects set off to find another white flower. The pollen on the body can be used for the water lily. insemination. The flower that completed the mission was withdrawn to the underwater world until it changed into another form. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony steered the yacht and slowly rubbed the edges of the watery lotus leaves with spikes through the water that was completely occupied by them. Under the tight seal of numerous huge blades of six feet in diameter, there was no plant. You can get plenty of sunshine and air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha leaned over the body and dropped one hand into the water. At night, the temperature here will be reduced from 40 degrees Celsius to 10 degrees Celsius, and the river will become It was cold, and a giant squid about three meters long was worn under the tiny hand, and then walked back. This legendary tyrannical giant freshwater fish seems to like this game very much. It has been repeated several times. Until Sasha put his hand back in his cloak. However, Anthony knows that it is still very close, because with the ability of night vision, he can see the sharp and long head of the behemoth from time to time, the blue metallic back, the bronze side and the edge. Bright red patches of bright scales. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The yacht re-entered into the narrow, undercurrent that was covered by the jungle, and the dense tropical plants occasionally touched the heads of Sasha and Anthony, sometimes needing to bow, sometimes You need Anthony to use the sharp long knife that you carry to open the branches and vines. In addition to the continuous bird songs in the forest, from time to time, there are strange kinds of strange sounds. It is difficult to tell which kind of creatures are making sounds. In the darkness of the bottomless bottom, there are shining eyes, which are crocodiles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the eve of the night, the crocodiles are surrounded by the yachts, like the ancient Inca rituals guarding their supreme rulers - Like the Son of the Sun, but they did not try to climb the yacht, but marched along the ship in the dark water, only a small albino crocodile jumped into the cabin, after being swayed, it was again Go back to the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then there is the old friend of Sasha, the Mori, they are not as polite as crocodiles, they hurriedly climbed to the branches above the waterway Then, when Sasha passed by, a slamming sound fell in front of her, or from the crocodile forced out a narrow passage into the yacht, and soon, Sasha was full of complicated patterns, no Stopping the twisted "belt", this situation has been a little better until the huge scorpion with a personal class name slams up and sweeps them all out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony turned off the yacht's engine, jumped out of the driver's seat and sat next to the little daughter, her body exudes a light, thin white gold glow. The calm and quiet look seems to be an angel in human imagination. Anthony didn't know what it would be like to sprinkle in the eyes of animals, but one thing is certain, they love her and they are a little afraid of her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He relaxes his body, lying on his back, his right hand holding the weak body of Sasha, even if they are above, there is no tropical jungle. The black small group of mosquitoes smog around the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the water is particularly clear in this quiet environment, all this, and six years ago, Anthony Hopkins was holding a full moon. Little Sasha sneaked into the jungle when the ordinary people were scared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;....................................<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack exclaimed exaggeratedly, this handsome man with a good appearance in the faint morning light of Amazon re-applied the old tricks played at the airport, to each passing by The man waved and showed his white teeth, especially when the beauty passed, his smile was even more charming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Catherine stood at the front desk and silently filled out the passenger registration form. Her face was blue--the people I saw were very understanding, after all, that It is too odious to have such a beautiful wife who dares to seduce other women in such a bright and honest manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your room is Room 407 of Tower 3, this is the key to the room. You can leave your luggage here, I will call the baggage to help you immediately."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The receptionist at the front desk smiled awkwardly and handed a silver-white door card. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, that..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you grinding?! I am fast Exhausted! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just Catherine wants to take the opportunity to ask if he has seen an Anthony Hopkins with a blond-eyed little girl When I stayed here, Jack, who was still glaring at the beauty half a second ago, grabbed the door card agilely and rudely, grabbed her arm and said loudly: "Let's go back to the room first, what will happen? Say!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack has been dragging Katherine onto the trestle that connects the tower to the tower and stopped. There are not many people here in the morning. He leaned on Katherine's ear and said with annoyance: "What are you doing? Idiot!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am at..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caceline only said a half sentence and realized her mistake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will drive you through the car for a whole night without knowing the target? Well, will you? You say!... ...damn, can I be so untrustworthy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I never knew what you were doing, and you never said to me, how do you trust me? You!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey? You...well..." Jack suddenly dropped his shoulder like a deflated ball. "This is my fault. ..., but Catherine, we are not, our goal is not to listen to people who will slap their hands on the wall of small drug dealers, you can not do this, understand?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand...Sorry, I won’t do this next time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine feels that her blood is already All concentrated on the cheeks, she held her fists hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't have to say sorry," Jack said with a sigh of relief: "After all, you were just an ordinary person who didn't know anything about it..." I am not right... you are right, we should go that trestle!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inexplicable topic shifts let Catherine look up, Jack quickly Kissing a kiss on her cheek, with a very low voice: "It is the goal, don't be nervous, don't look back, let's go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine’s heart jumped completely uncontrollably. She originally wanted to go straight back to the tower where the reception room was located, according to Jack’s words. The two feet violated their will and turned in the other direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the morning mist, a tall, handsome gray-haired male is leisurely walking towards the center of the trestle, his high-necked black plush sweater fits and considerate Under the small square, four bronze buckles, meticulously embedded in the embroidered safari that only aristocrats can wear hundreds of years ago, are perfectly matched with his long body; the little girl he is holding in his arms is tight Holding his neck, the blue-violet eyes look like chromic anhydride, the crystal of chromium trioxide in the smog - chromic anhydride, namely chromium trioxide (commercially known as chromic acid, molecular formula cro3), in dark red or dark purple It is a crystalline or granular crystal, easily soluble in water, and the aqueous solution is acidic and is a strong oxidant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
