Young women are an abductor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine and other people and Sasha's situation stabilized, and found a suitable opportunity, at the convenience of the hospital, got two tubes of lidocaine (local) and a small scalpel, managed to remove the tracker in the earlobe in the bathroom; on the night, after the doctor’s patrol ended, she stole the sand from the pediatric ward, and the two were attached to the hospital. After the small garden was replaced with two sets of casual clothes and shoes purchased in the hospital supermarket, Catherine hugged her, just like any mother with a child's night clinic, and walked out of the hospital in a hurry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine took out all the deposits in the bank of Manaus, most of which she got after working in the institution, she was happy not to have a movie There is often a plot in it - her account is not frozen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that she went to buy a mild hair dye and a degreeless contact lens that only changed the color of the iris, whenever and wherever, the blond purple eye of the sand It always leaves a deep impression, and she is not the type that can be forgotten. (She is a little proud of it, but it is really troublesome, especially now). After doing this, Catherine carefully chose a family hotel, the kind of hotel that still uses the written name rather than the computer to register the guest name, so that Amazon or the “institution” can find her through the hotel registration list connected to the network. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hotel, she excused Sasha to be unwell (as it is), did not go out to wander every day like normal tourists, but stayed at the hotel to read the newspaper: she I am very happy. I saw in the newspaper that there is no Jack’s name on the death list caused by the Ariawu fire. He is a clever guy. Catherine thought that he would leave earlier than anyone else. Mori and the fire should not What effect on him, but she can guarantee that Jack will never choose a woman to be a partner in the future, unless she is Ruth regeneration (Note 1). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even Ruth couldn’t look at his sister’s children, and his only relatives fell into the hands of the devil and continued to live their days, regardless of their own time. Such a hard-hearted heart, even the big Lila (Note 2) may not have. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine did not find that she was subconsciously finding reasons and excuses for herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She thought too much, didn't notice that Mrs. Alan, who was walking in front of her, stopped in front of a cheese stall. The young woman who had slammed almost knocked her down. If it wasn't for the latter, because of years of hard work and nutrition, there was plenty. The food piles up with the words of enviable muscles and fat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Catherine~" Mrs. Alan shouted Catherine’s name, and her tail was slightly prolonged, indicating that she was dissatisfied, but not angry, after receiving Catherine’s apology. She did not care to put a piece of cheese with orange-red rind outside, and the cream inside the creamy yellow was sent straight under Catherine's nose: "Eat it," she ordered, of course, "You haven't been there this morning." Have breakfast."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cheese tastes mellow, full of aroma, sticking to Catherine's teeth, and she bites the second bit, and she is amazed that Mrs. Alan is going to lettuce. Walking over the stall, she glanced at the owner of the cheese stall. It was an old man who was cutting his goods with a knife with a finger length, and then ate his own breakfast with red wine. I don’t want to look at them with my eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine embarrassedly grabbed a piece of hard-skinned cheese that looked good and had a blue-green pattern, but found that it could not be used to calculate the price and weight. Any kind of instrument, she stood so stupidly for a while, feeling that the cheese in her hand was fast, and the old man who had finished eating a row of cheese finally turned his compassionately from the cheese to this somewhat small face. Girl: "What do you want cheese to do?" he asked unknowingly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...呃," Catherine felt the problem was strange, but she had to answer: "Eat."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man glanced at her with a scornful look: "Mozzarella cheese," he pointed to a light-colored cheese: "made of buffalo, suitable for making pizza; Parmesan cheese, He turned to another golden-colored dairy product: "wipe into crumbs, as a condiment of Italian pasta, soups and other dishes, and can also be made into delicate desserts, which are very good with pears; Ma Shijiapeng Cheese, used to make tiramisu; also made with goat's milk, salted soft cheese, used as an appetizer, you just eat soft cheese that I washed with wine, more suitable It is used for breakfast and after-dinner snacks. Now you are holding blue cheese in your hand. It has a strong taste, a wonderful topping for baking vegetables and pasta, and a cheese platter."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His tone makes Catherine feel that the first two decades are simply vain, most The old man picked up a few pieces of fresh cheese and hard unripe cheese for her, because both of them are one of the few cheeses that the "new beginner" is better at. Each piece of cheese can be said in his hand. The weight and tone are conclusive. Catherine didn't dare to doubt this. God knows that she is just embarrassed to eat such a large piece of free cheese. She used to try it in the city supermarket, but it was always a small toothpick. Not so delicious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the embarrassment of the old man "you still have to learn more with your mother", Catherine carefully put the crumbling cheese into her basket and chase it. Mrs. Alan, who was squatting in front of a tomato stall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you think of this tomato?" Mrs. Alan frowned. "When the tomato here has not been ripe yet, this should be from the outside." She grabbed a tomato, looked at its stem and buttocks, pinched it, sniffed it, and ruined it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine felt that the tomato was very good, bright red, plump, and the stalks were still sap, and it was seen that it was just picked in the morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but Mrs. Alan did not need her help, she decided to take a risk to buy a little to taste, Catherine also bought a little, the old man of the cheese stall did not say Wrong, she came to study today, although Mrs. Alan is not her mother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She and Sasha came here five months ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine spent a few days in the city of Manaus for her new documents. The past that is unbearable is not without its benefits, at least she is now using it - she uses a computer to contact a forged documentary expert who is said to be very reliable, and then remits photos of herself and Sasha, as well as certain cash, about seven Twelve hours later, she found her and Sasha’s birth certificate, medical insurance, passport, driver’s license, and marriage certificate from the international postal parcel (according to her request, Sasha was her and another unneeded The common marriage of a man) and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The future destination is Catherine's decision, although it is in a hurry, but she thinks this place is definitely no better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She never traveled here before, or asked and investigated this place. Regarding the information about it, Catherine was from the classmates of the university and the dormitory. The girl named Miranda complained endlessly in Catherine’s upper store after she turned off the lights at night, complaining about her conservative parents. The omnipresent neighbors and the nosy of the elders, and this backward town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is located in the other small towns of the state, adjacent to the valley, on the mountainside, and between the other towns are surrounded by vast forests, fields, and large areas. The land that people have developed relies on the natural soaps, various oils, shampoos and skin care products for Manoske's cosmetics companies, such as lavender, geranium, sage, vetiver, cedar wood. Essential oils such as oak moss, peaches, apricots, etc., sometimes use their cores and leaves. The people here are basically believers of the sects. They can't tolerate lies and concealment. They like the unchanging traditional life. They hate outsiders, or anything foreign. There are only bakeries, cloth shops, butchers, post offices and Cafes, a rudimentary family hotel, no ready-to-wear stores, supermarkets, bars, cinemas and wireless networks, only one sheriff who seems to be embellished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine came out of Amazon (before she did not forget to put the tracking device into a suitcase full of customs labels), went on A ready-to-wear shop dedicated to the believers of the sects, bought half a dozen black dresses and headscarves, flat shoes, and took care of themselves, properly and properly, and cautiously, silently, many people They mistakenly believe that she is a believer in the sect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she arrived in this small town, she went straight to the small hotel that was explained by the top-floor roommates for numerous explanations. Mrs. Alan greeted her with vigilance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Katherine told her that she was entrusted by Miranda and came to visit her relatives in this town. She brought them a pass. A recent photo of Miranda that was disguised but definitely not recognized by the people here, and a short note that was vivid and vivid, she was not suspected, although she could not provide Miranda's recent contact details. But I can see that her family has great joy for photos and letters, as well as her "friends". They surrounded her and listened to her describing Miranda's life outside, lest she missed even a detail. (Although Miranda's grandfather and father have been disdainful, and entertained her and Sasha to have dinner and provide accommodation - this is a very rare thing for the people here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the husband of the husband, Catherine, who had nowhere to go with a child, lived in the Miranda family until she found a copy of Mrs. Alan. Work and live to her because of the need for work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you like this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Alan interrupted Catherine’s memories again. She held a big brown-shelled egg: “This is the best for boys, one early, one late, and healthy.” She put the eggs in the basket: “You The family's Sasha is all good, and the body is too empty." Her family has three boys, each of whom has the pedigree of cattle, wild boars and monkeys, and Catherine's children, probably because they had no fathers very early. For the sake of it, quiet and delicate is like a little girl who does not leave home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, of course." Catherine smiled and rubbed her eyes: "Of course."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Yes, Sasha is a boy on the birth certificate. Because this is the case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Alan looked at Catherine in confusion, because the smile on the face of this young woman became strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She remembered her first small confrontation with Sasha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine was really surprised when she saw the "Men" sign on the hospital bed, so in the hospital, she gave Sasha Bringing a small bib and shirt, a cap, and before leaving Amazon, Sasha had no objection to Catherine’s men’s clothing for him (now it should be “he”), but in that supervisor’s special clothing In the store, when Catherine entered the fitting room, he chose all the skirts for himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I thought you knew you were a boy." Catherine remembered holding her arm. The first time I knew that Sasha was a boy, she didn't mention how angry and lucky she was - Sasha is only six years old, and it should not be because of this psychological and physiological irreversible influence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Louis XIV also wears a skirt before the minor (Note 3)." The six-year-old boy raised his eyebrows, and before that he remained silent. Does not exist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So he died three hundred years ago." Catherine eloquently said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha found that he didn’t know what to say. In fact, the biggest reason he wears a skirt is his father, Mr. Anthony Hopkins has always loved him. Plus, Sasha doesn't think it's a big deal to wear a skirt to keep his father's mental state stable. He has always knew that he is a boy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You don’t need to wear a jacket with i.am.a.boy. (I am a boy) with a sequined patch. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last two took a step back, Catherine gave up the sequined jacket, and Sasha gave up the skirt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Catherine," Mrs. Alan broke a fresh juicy cucumber and handed half of it to Catherine: "Taste the cucumber." You should also stop the uncomfortable smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine learned to sprinkle her eyebrows, no wonder Mrs. Alan told her not to go out for breakfast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Slightly bitter." Mrs. Alan: "Not in my hotel."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two continue Going forward, the basket did not contain cucumbers that did not match the taste of the hotel. The woman who guarded the cucumber stall did not reveal a trace of unpleasantness. Catherine told herself not to feel guilty. This is the case. Every stall owner has to accept the housewife without mercy. Carefully selected and tasted, don't taste it yourself, how do you know how to be good or bad? If you feel comfortable, of course, some people will buy it. If you feel bad, it is normal, but if you are too careless and arrogant, you have to get out of this market. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Alan is like a hen with a chicken all the way forward, and tastes olives, lettuce, peaches, rye, jam and cheese in the east, and there are more and more things in their baskets. Finally, Mrs. Alan decided to buy some more olive oil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a lot of people gathered around the olive oil stand, next to it is an old truck, like other stalls, the rear of the truck is stretched The activity table, the event table is filled with sparkling glass wine glasses, fresh red rose wine in the glass, men and women around the cup, and enjoy the gift from the Son of God. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Mrs. Alan immediately decided to take a look at the new wine, she took Katherine walked over, and everyone can see affectionate hellos. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Catherine know quite a few, precise point, she did not know of very few people, which thanks to the work she received from Mrs. Alan there . <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Although Mrs. Alan hotel was open, but there will be very few tourists visited the town, everyone has a home here, so the main income from the wife of Alan On the first floor of the grocery store. She sells spices for cooking, tea, sugar, salt, envelopes, toilet paper, detergents, needles and other daily necessities, and she and her family live on the second floor, the way the store is upstairs and downstairs. The best and worst thing is that you don't have a break at all. Whenever people need something, they will force you to knock on your store until they get what they want. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Alan tried to make this store the best, every kind of goods was neatly arranged, the wood cabinets and glass jars were clean, sugar Salt and tea are always wrapped in one pound and half a pound. They don’t delay the guests’ time. It’s such a good shopkeeper, but because the doctor warned her that if she can’t keep a good sleep, she might have life. When you are in danger, you have to put your needs in the second place. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; can imagine how sad she was, but this time, Catherine took to the sand ...... she thought that she played a role in prayer to God. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Katherine Mrs. Alan live on the second floor, near the stairs, while the wife and Alan sand is staying at the third floor to be easily disturbed. “Children, like the elderly, need a long, good night's sleep to be healthy,” Mrs. Alan said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The task of receiving customers and delivering and withdrawing money according to the order basically made Catherine work, and the work was not hard, but Catherine felt very happy and relaxed. . This job quickly integrated her into the town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a clean and unimaginable place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aria's everything is like a nightmare, and there is no trace in a blink of an eye. And "ghoul", "black ritual", "institution", Mary, Jack, and even their own abilities are all stored in the most secret corner of the brain. If it is not necessary, she will not re-enter them. Released. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "Good morning, Mrs. Alan morning;." Good morning, Sergeant Aaron "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp. Ok, Catherine.” The young man, who was leaning on the truck and tasting the new wine, smiled and nodded to Mrs. Alan and Catherine and toasted. He is not tall, has brown hair and black eyes, the face is square, and there is a pretty sexy gap in the middle of his chin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like his name, this sheriff who was transferred not long ago was a good old man with a good temper. Catherine knows that the most recent joke about him is: The foreign, grumpy guy saw that he was giving a ticket to his car, so he rudely asked him: "Don't you have anything else to do?" And he replied: "It seems to have been So."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
