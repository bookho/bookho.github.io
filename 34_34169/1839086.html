			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After encountering Anthony Hopkins, Catherine was uncharacteristically silent, and she walked back to their room with a sly look, mechanically showering, changing Clothes, swallowing too late breakfast and too early lunch, and finally Jack was shaking impatiently to wake her from a semi-coma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing? Catherine." Jack frowned, tightly, as a change in state, in the bastard The bastard has been dealing with members of the organization for more than three years. His sixth feeling is not inferior to any slender and sensitive woman. From a few days ago, no, since the task was received, his intestines and stomach have been falling heavily. The feeling of discomfort has intensified, and now almost let him vomit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We must leave here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bad premonition asked him to ask again five minutes ago After a little "friends" in the organization, some information that was not clearly available made him very uneasy - no, there is no definite information to explain which one is true, even if he has extracted his own brain. The 3D image of the character was converted into a password image and sent back to the organization through the Internet. But so far, there is no comparison of successful photos. There are only two possibilities. One is that the kid's bastard is just an innocent idiot, and the other is that beautiful. The face has undergone a facelift – the main client is a high-precision mechanized facelift of the perpetrator. It has very little modification to the facial muscles and skin, but it can change the places that are too personal, the height and inclination of the bridge of the nose. Degree, the width between the eyes and the height of each other, the unevenness of the lower jaw, the contraction of the cheeks, etc. In short, in the scanning comparison between human eyes and computer crime records, these small changes It will play the biggest role, so that those who are too shy to open those patrons from out of sight close feverishly. At the same time, because of its relatively small and accurate modification, even if it is changed many times, it will not make the client's face stiff and rigid or the distortion and relaxation of small muscle bundles often occur after some cosmetic surgery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best thing is that it is safe and secret, ha, this is not to say that it often appears in a dark and narrow alley. The major hospitals in every metropolis have this profitable project, and then a large number of legal provisions guarantee all the rights of the client and the surgeon and the assistants. Well... according to the normal route, you can't see any records, ask There is no evidence of anything, unless you are willing to step into the ranks of the perpetrators - not many of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than one agency member complained about this, but unfortunately, those real big men are as urgently needed as criminals, so whether it is a country or an institution, Only this deformed sanctuary will continue to exist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, its cost is also quite expensive, and it is too expensive for a normal society to put it into the normal mind, so it will not be Ordinary people, no matter what the meaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bastards are for the action group to deal with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After meaninglessly for a while, Jack found that his thoughts had reached a considerable distance, and he almost wrinkled his eyes. Together, this is not a good sign. The inconspicuous tracker is just like honey attracting the bears to attract the death--"We should go." He said that the action group has received confirmation information, and soon Will come, it is reasonable to say that they should wait here, identify the target and then leave, but restless, Jack decided to throw away the damn Anthony, Hopkins, and possibly a bonus - no doubt this guy It won't be a baby. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your own safety is the most important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I don't want to go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Catherine!" God, what is it? What kind of demon is tempted to want a little girl as a partner? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can go first." The little girl said hesitantly: "I think I still have something to confirm."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack’s eyes narrowed and his arms were on his chest: “You are an IQ free...” He paused and swallowed the unspeakable noun, gently Ground, prolonged the voice: "Do you think we need a partner? And, first, before a bad guy is slaughtered by his own tracking object, his partner may be able to find a chance to send a signal or something; Second, it is also very likely that a git-funder accepts a sum of money, then closes his eyes and lets those sinful deaths slip away from the agency’s fingers, or generously The people in the action group are thrown into a trap, if there is enough money...not that this has not happened."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You see," he continued Road, erect a finger - not the middle finger - to stop Catherine from opening: "If I am separated from you Two days later, people found a part of you in the belly of a crocodile, or on a branch... I was finished, because I couldn’t tell you why you were separated from me, and I actually agreed. Even The agency failed to find out if I accepted the bribe. No one will partner with me anymore. I can't get the job, I can't get it, maybe I will be killed by a stranger as a traitor."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine swayed his head stubbornly. "No, I have reason, I can call my head and let me stay."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing!" Jack angrily grabbed the girl's arm: "Well, I am leading this action. If I say go, I have to go."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine angrily expressed opposition, while Jack began to scream, he grabbed his hand - It was the one who caught Catherine’s face. The expression on his face seemed like his arm had just been stepped on by a half-ton crocodile. He opened his hand in vain. The hand is not any trauma, clean, did not swell up, only the share of pain is crystal clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl who found out what she did was surprised to open her eyes and mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I should probably congratulate you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack reluctantly said: "You seem to develop "The skills that belong to the attack class."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry." Catherine said with embarrassment: "But I have reason."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because Catherine." Jack interrupted her words, and the voice returned to the original peace: "Your sister Catherine, you have been looking for her, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine looked at him in surprise, Jack grabbed his hair with the uninjured hand, and was very upset: "I am breaking the rules, Catherine. So you have to promise me, listen and leave." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My rank is higher than you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: "So there are some things you can't see Come to me. Catherine, your sister has been missing for several years. Before she disappeared, she was a very good woman. The last case she had was a psychological change. The guy who loves to peel off the skin and make clothes, She got the clue that she had contacted 'ghoul', and then the case broke, she got the reward, but ghoul fled - she was suspected to be related to this, you understand... she was suspended, and she was intermittently saying that she One person traces the terrible guy... What the organization can know is that the person who ghoul finally killed is her top boss, who has eaten the liver and the brain, and no one has seen your sister since that day..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
