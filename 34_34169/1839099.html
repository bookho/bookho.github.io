			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That night, the town was raining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first, it was only a little two drops. It was not even a dust on the ground, but with the wind blowing, the cold raindrops were like small steel balls sprayed by shotguns. That kind of slammed into the people, the residents of the town had to let go of half of the celebrations and ran back to their warm and mellow home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This rain will either not come, or it will be endless. Two days have passed. There is no difference between day and night. The sky is always gloomy. The rain pouring from the dark clouds is as dense as the sun two days ago. The elders in the town began to bring the young men to help the families who were unfortunately in the low places and were soaked in water. The valuable furniture was moved. On the second or top level of the impact of stagnant water, their children and the elderly are placed in neighbors and friends with idle rooms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ready." One of them said to Mrs. Alan: "Your guests can move, and the people in the town need a room." He sat down on the chair in front of the counter and squeaked it, then took up one leg and took off his boots with mud and leaves. The socks inside could not see the original color. He twisted his toes, and the blue-black water flowed like tears: "How are they? Is it still stable?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It’s not like that.” Mrs. Alan sent a tray of steaming coffee and won a warm cheer: “When do they come to take people away?” Because of the last thing, Mrs. Alan is not at ease now. A foreign woman - who knows if she has noticed something. It’s just raining these two days. Mrs. Alan’s business is sparse in rainy days, and she is forced to rest in the attic. She occasionally goes up to see some oatmeal or a quiche with deer flower. Reddish brown, twisted into the shape of the brain, the shape of the mushroom is good, but if it is not cleaned, it will cause diarrhea and coma. Sure enough, for a whole day, young women can only linger between the bathroom and the bedroom, and the beautiful face becomes terrible because of previous beatings and dehydration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On these two days." The senior screamed and sipped hot hot coffee: "You can bring a few people and send her to the barn first." Or go to the wine cellar."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't have a barn. There are several good wine cellars in the cellar for ten years."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have." A ghostly young man shouted: "I can look at her all night long." His words made the men laugh out loud. Come, they are half-truthfully asking themselves to get this power, including even a big boy who is only fifteen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope they can hurry, this is not always the same thing." Mrs. Alan shouted: "A scourge." She thought of Catherine's pair of rounds. The strong snow white ru room, like the soft and smooth skin with fine velvet fresh peach, gold wool-like hair and ruby ​​red lips, is a stomach unhappy. She plucked the coffee cups and slammed them into a bang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be stupid." The elders glanced majestly at the young people of this group: "You and I don't care, I will let Jim in the cafe is responsible for this, he has a very good cellar (men are snoring and dissatisfied). If you need it, you can go there to drink coffee (small down). Don't be too much, bear "Come on," he warned harshly. "Don't blind her eyes, don't touch her tongue, ears, don't leave holes in her. You know, if everything goes well, it will give us a payment." To create a new church, to imitate the new church of the Roman Jesuits.” His face showed a radiant glow: “We may be able to invite a holy object from Rome.”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold face of Mrs. Alan’s condensation disappeared, but for a moment she appeared as a soft and sweet side like the melted toffee under the sun: “A new church,” she shouted in the accent of hymns, excitedly Draw a cross on the chest: "Constructed in white marble, with a new bell tower and a new clock!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," the seniors must say: "So, who dares to ruin the deal, who will get out of this town!" He was pleased to see the young men bowing their heads in awe, expressing obedience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, it’s the most stable to put this woman and child directly in the only prison in the town; but in this case...they know this woman It’s a fugitive, but I don’t know her crimes. This will make people in the town feel a little uncomfortable. Second, who will solve the evil fires of these boys? They have been tired for so many days and need to relax. . Anyway, those people have never minded the slight defect of "goods", and this can be said to be a way to "punish" rebellion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, if his wife can sleep earlier, he is also very interested in going to Jim to "drink some coffee." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, they heard a scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shop that was filled with obscenity and devout desires suddenly quieted down and people were quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After another scream penetrated the heavy rain curtain, one after another, from the beginning to the end according to the rhythm of 3/4 beats, one sound farther than one, one sound More screaming than one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing," I don't know who whispered, "That is the monkey screaming."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monkey is screaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sergeant Abel took out a silver lighter from his pocket and ordered a strong, flue-cured cigarette. He smoked a little over the two days. But only in this way can we get rid of the scent that can't be squandered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The circus tents were not demolished, and the townspeople only added a protective net made of wood and iron bars to the fence. The tigers that attacked and swallowed the original owner walked around the fence. Their yellow-black striped fur shone like a satin luster under the dim light, and they barely saw the traces that had been burned before. The eyes were like good. The pigeon's blood red is so shiny, the long tongue is constantly sticking out, pink, with a hook. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Human flesh seems to be more appetizing than the meat of cattle or sheep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monkeys are screaming, their fur is not as clean as a tiger, the vests dotted with colored beads are covered with tissue and blood, and the tangled arms of the fur are caught. The railings of the cages are shaking desperately, and the boxes are framed, which makes people hate... The poodles are turning under their tails, making a weak snoring. The sheriff is not sure if they are hungry or something else. what reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The circus people were sentenced to death, and the animals survived because an elephant or tiger can sell more than a thousand pieces, one The monkeys are worth two hundred. The trained camels, zebras, and dogs add up to a large number. They can neither speak nor revenge for their former masters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the sake of economy and convenience, the animals were rushed together (monkeys and poodles were kept in cages, elephants and zebras, camels were shackled On the bar), the bodies of those condemned prisoners were used as feed for the animals by the townspeople. They were tigers at first, then dogs, monkeys, and finally hungry camels, zebras, and elephants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is to say, two or three things, the bodies of the eight people are nothing left, and they also save the burial and care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cigarette flashed a dark red shimmer in front of the sheriff's nose, like the eyes of the animals. The sheriff once saw in a book that the human eye that eats the same kind will turn red, but according to what he now sees, the animal eyes that eat humans will also turn red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty red eyes are shining in the dark tent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monkeys continued to scream and the sheriff walked away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Screaming and screaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a monkey stopped yelling, it fell like a golden leaf in the left corner of the cage - there was a pool of bedding In the clothing of fat and blood, it stretches out the furry arm and pokes out the fingers, just like a picky woman picking up the big intestine and flipping her fingertips over the pile of material, quickly, accompanied by a slight The metal collided, a bunch of keys slipped out, and the key ring also had a half finger. The monkey blinked, ate his fingers, and then looked for it in the key. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monkey can remember how humans do it - a medium-sized key with a green plastic monkey set up to enhance human memory. It grabbed the back of the key and extended the arm from the gap in the cage. The black finger with sharp nails squirmed quickly at the edge of the cage. After a few moments, the lock was found. The next step was simple. More, it opened the lock with the key and then opened the cage door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One after the other, the monkeys climbed out of the cage, they first felt a much wider space than the previous residence, then yelled and jumped On the auditorium and the isolation bar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tiger threatened to scream, and the monkeys had quickly climbed up to the top of the fence, where there was a shield that covered the nails from the gap between the boards. A monkey touched it and slammed his hand back as if there was electricity or flame on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top plate is very tightly closed, the monkeys swayed in vain for a while, jumped one by one, they jumped on the elephant On the back, scratch your ears or wash your fur for other monkeys. The zebras and camels that were isolated on the other side were disturbed by uneasiness, and a monkey broke into them. It was eager to wander around and soon found another cage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cages connected to the fence were originally prepared for the tigers. At the beginning of the show, they can enter the performance field directly from the cage, directly at the end. Go back to the cage and then drag them one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monkey who has mastered the cockroach has not hesitated to open the cage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tiger that had remained in a state of stagnation immediately stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monkey screamed, sharper than any previous one. It dropped the key, grabbed the hanging tail, and climbed to the nearest end. On the back of the elephant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The biggest and brightest tiger is near the cage, sniffing, not scrutinizing a part of the body, then part of it, waiting for its tail When the tip disappeared into the cage of the black hole, the second tiger followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
