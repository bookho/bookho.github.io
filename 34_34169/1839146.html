			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Henry immediately showed a relief, "But, but what about these squid, what should I do?" He stuttered, apparently he didn't want to Give up this accidental prize, but don't want to be guilty of theft: "The squid is a delicate thing," his two hands continually turned over and over again: "Even if you throw them back, it won't last long... delicate things." He repeated and emphasized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you keep yourself," said Streif: "Mr. Henry, after all, it first hinders your work, a little compensation, I don't think there is anything." He said carelessly, and looked at the broken head: "And it's very likely, it's just a prank - as you said, this fishing method was only a few decades ago. Popular - maybe someone just cut the head and threw it in the swamp. He didn't want to get anything from it. Just restore it as it is. Also, as you said before. You can try to drain these swamps and see what surprises there are. In addition to squid, squid and squid, this kind of fish is also very popular. These two kinds of fish are simpler to cook than squid, and the taste is different. I think You and your family will like them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Henry has a snack, his eyes are turning around in the strong light and the darkness around him. But after a few minutes, he seems to figure out something: "No. He said: "I feel that today's harvest is rich enough." He showed the kind of embarrassment that ordinary people often have: "I think it is enough," he said loudly: "I am not going to move those few." The swamp is not ready to catch the squid by that method. No, fifty years ago, it was a good time for fishermen and hunters, but now," he shook his head: "Where can we find fresh animal heads?" No? The butcher shop doesn't, the restaurant doesn't, yes, we can go to the slaughterhouse, but the radical animal protectionists will screw my head down and throw it into the swamp - because they have been yelling for animal needs and people Get the same treatment." He suddenly shuddered, as if he had thought of something. He quickly bent down, picked up the empty head, and quickly crossed the bridge and returned to the swamp that had been evacuated. "Let us Look for it... well, great," he straightened up and showed Straight the catch of mud: "My mission is complete." He said: "I will take this Put your head back Everything is restored."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did, the dog’s head was thrown back to the bottom of the swamp, and the pump started to slam again. Unlike before, they were Fill the water inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Streiff found him a little uneasy. “Is there any problem?” he asked politely, holding his hand on the bridge railing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you really want it?" Mr. Henry replied, "Squid? The two biggest?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No," Streiff replied patiently: "No, I don't want to fish. Are you sure there is nothing I need to help?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "If you can," Mr. Henry said with a grin, "Please don't say anything tonight, not only the dog's head and the squid, but also the other ones."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I won't. But why," said Streif: "Even if the swamp or the dog's head is the owner, your behavior is still legal and correct. They can't help the owner to get his belongings back. Just like someone accidentally drops a pack of cash in your garden, he still has the right to ask for it. Of course, you may have to pay for the pack of squid, but Then wait for them to prove that these lovable little things are actually produced here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Lee showed a reluctant smile: "Not only this," he said. "There seems to be more people here recently. Have you heard of it? A group of animal rights protectionists are very radical. They are said to be at the university research institute. In the arson, a bomb was placed in the hospital, and there was a guinea pig farm owner who had encountered and attacked. Someone threw bricks at his house. The grave of his mother-in-law was demolished, and the bones were gone. It’s so bad, you see, I am just an ordinary person, I am afraid of them." He made a gesture: "I am afraid that they will think that this is what I did - God knows that there are two strong and happy big dogs in my family. I am right about them. Like to be a son."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Streif nodded: "I understand what you mean, well, I will keep it secret." He added Tao: "I can swear to God that this secret will never leak out of my mouth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reassure you and me." Mr. Henry confirmed Increase the volume of the last few words: "You Too mind, I am afraid of those guys. Satan testified, I will not be happy to give the dogs a slap or cut their heads, but I will occasionally give them a foot, or cancel a What about dinner, this is no way, or how can you let them go? You also have a dog? Then you know how vicious they are, running around, biting slippers, peeing in the pool, missed Unexpectedly yelling, deliberately scaring every passing person... They are a group of ruthless little monsters, you can give them a meal, sleep with them, play with them, but also remember to teach them, otherwise they will The little devil who grew up in the tail. But those people," said the gold watch, he wiped it clean and put it in his jacket: "Look at their flyers, you have to stare at them like a nobleman." Every need - physical and psychological, well, the previous one is fine, I know that they love Wolff and meat bones, but who knows the psychology of a dog? Is it falling out of love? Stress from work? Or is the promotion failed? Still too shy to start social activities? Even if Satan personally came to the demon law, I might not be able to do it. ! He shouted dissatisfiedly: "If I can do it, I would prefer to use it on my wife. At least I can know why she didn't give me a good look for a whole month, because I didn't have her." Going to visit the mother-in-law (the old witch who raised a house cat!) Or did I ignore the promotional advertisement (jewelry store!) placed on the bedside table? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, listen to you," said Streif. "Have you ever handed over to them?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I used to work at the university's research institute. "The security guard." Mr. Henry said: "I thought it would be a calm and safe job, but I was wrong. There, on the right side of our dormitory, I found two bombs! Two!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was a little excited, it seems that the memory is really too bad for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are a learned person," Mr. Henry said indignantly: "Do you think they are doing right? Well, right?" He took the bridge Under the bar, I turned a corner and struggled across the roots of the grass and walked up. His shoes were covered with mud and moss. "Isn't human beings the master of all things? Isn't God giving humans to control everything?" Glory status? And they want us to please a dog, a mouse or a fish! We provide them with a shelter from the wind, three meals a day, clean drinking water, and companions and Doctors! - On the legal level, they are still our property 可 - but now, look, there are some humans who ask us to treat them as "people", God, then people? What about our kind?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course it’s like...food." Streiff said softly, sighingly, even if it’s so low that it’s not on his lips. Got, but Sasha heard it, he grabbed his father’s hand He found a fingertip hot, cold palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Mr. Henry was able to see his face, Streif put away a smile on his face - we are all familiar with this smile. It can make many people fear that the limbs are soft or even. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So that's it," he said. "It's already late. I haven't had dinner with Sasha yet." He looked at the sky. Nearly October, the twilight came early and fast, silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry," said Mr. Henry. "I delayed you. If possible, please come to my house for dinner next time. You will book the time." He said "It's a pity that without the damn animal protectionists, we can definitely try the work my grandfather had done. Now the squid... Do you know what price has already arrived? One pound and ten dollars, still It’s not wild, it’s farmed. Chinese people raise them in fish ponds and can grow to two feet in five years. It’s imaginable that meat tastes meager, like cotton or cereal, and there’s no wild beauty. "He said." Of course, it would be better if there was no farm, squid," he shook his head. "It used to be something that nobles and wealthy people could afford."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
