			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avery. Famo has been a little weird since he took the call. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the words of his roommate, it’s like a roast squid pie that was eaten at noon and lived in his stomach, but it doesn’t look like it’s not Happy: "What's the matter with you?" he asked with concern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My sister is getting married," Avery said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's great," said the roommate. "Is your first sister?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I only have one sister," Avery said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!" His roommate sat up from his bed. "You told me last month that she will be the next!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avery rubbed his temples hard: "She changed her mind, she decided to get back to marriage - and one, and then gave birth to half a dozen children."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I also kept the signature photo you gave me... I thought I could make a fortune after 15 years." The roommate said disappointed: "Or I can Fifteen years later, sold to her son or daughter... Mom’s black history, what do you think?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can’t guarantee that after fifteen months How, Avery thought, since she was able to lean on her legs, his sister seemed to have never walked the road who had arranged for her - she started fighting with people in the kindergarten, starting from the sixth grade I started to skip school, mixed with boys, smoked and smoked, and abused drugs. My parents sent her to a boarding school with strict management and strict management. She was politely sent back because she hooked up half a dozen students and two teachers - are women. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She left home when she was seventeen, and her father yelled at your mother’s egg while on the phone with him. He doesn’t need this anymore. He and his wife broke their hearts and lost their daughters - but Avery knew that they love her very much. They just can't accept what she did. God, the Famo family is not a rich family. There is no long history of inheritance. The original name of "Famo" means the farmer - if there is no highway that has to cross the Farm of Farms, they are now just ordinary families who are under the economic pyramid of the Western Confederation - However, the Famo family has always been clear and indifferent, and there has never been a criminal in their family. It has not appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ferrola’s whimsy made Avery’s roommate very disappointed, but his father and mother were happy. The phone was called by Avery's mother, she was very excited, she consulted Avery, is to customize a new wedding dress for Ferrola or let Ferrola wear her wedding dress - her marriage is very happy, very happy, This will be a good sign - she also has a phone call with all the good friends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ferrara's friends - those who have rings on their lips, belly and nostrils, shaved heads, tattoos and black lips have long since the mother's memory Deleted, she needs some innocent and good girl to give Ferrola a bridesmaid. The two children of his cousin were booked as flower children. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She also listed a list of guests with about 200 people, and also planned to send the bride and groom a house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avery made a face, he did not know if Ferrola would escape with her husband after learning about this series of arrangements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His mother called him to let him find a few handsome boys at the school to attend the wedding, because she was on the list of guests. I found too many teenage girls: "Who will invite them to dance when they arrive?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He invited his roommate, the roommate has been from the previous I broke free from the frustration. "I was the first time I attended a non-relative wedding," he said with great enthusiasm: "Should I have a gift?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avery grabbed her hair. This habit was inherited from his sister: "We are still students," he remembers his roommate is the pottery club: "Give them a fruit bowl and draw a bull on it. My sister likes a bull." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good idea," his roommate said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avery smiled happily, picked up the book, prepared to go to the library, their room was different from Besib and Sasha, it was a double room. There is no reception room. The two beds are placed on the sides of the thin and long floor-to-ceiling windows. There are no bedside tables, the beds are high, and there are drawers for private items. The tails of the beds are facing each other. There is a moving picture frame on the wall, students can pick it up and put on the poster or painting they want. Next to the wall is a bathroom with a shower. Next to the wall is a row of wardrobes, separated in the middle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no place to put a desk, so if they want to read a book or write homework, they will go to the library. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After moving out of the suites in Besib and Sasha, Avery’s parents wanted to apply for another suite bedroom or single room for Avery, but Avery refused. He looked at the other. The dormitory has chosen this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that time, he was very upset when he saw Besib and Sasha. In addition to jealousy, there was a kind of guilt and sadness that was despised and abandoned, especially Sasha Hopkins, in Avery’s heart, he felt that he was the first to know Hopkins, and he had suffered together and had been sinned. They should be a country, not the Besib. Than mulberry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He met Sasha Hopkins in the library, he couldn’t tell if he was deliberately picking this time to go to the library - Hopkin There is no more than Sangdi, yes, Besib. Bissand is training now, which gives Avery a little hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My sister is getting married," he said, a round blush. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Congratulations." Hopkins’s plain answer suddenly wiped out Avery’s little bit of courage, and he stood there. Looking at Hopkins, a dark-haired girl is waiting for him outside the library. He knows her. She is Lila, Hopkins’s girlfriend. She just entered Grande and went to the cheerleaders. The girl thought she used some small means that could not see the light, but there was no evidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lila holds a large, dry, dried lavender, ochre, plum and violet smudged flowers, wrapped in cotton paper. This lavender leaf is very thin and the flower spikes are short, which is suitable for making perfumes and spices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The end of the training camp?" Sasha said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's over," Lila said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the arrest of Osien Douglas for murder and illegal manufacture and sale of drugs, his dangerous plants have been destroyed and his "deep water" club has been ordered. Cancelled, but Grande retained his garden and laboratory - Mr. Nenet took over there, and he gave the small community founded on this basis a harmless and soft name, Crowris cultivation Will (Crawleys, the flower god in Greek mythology, meaning blooming flowers), so as not to touch the sensitive nerves of the school board, although the name is easily confused by others "Sunshine Weaving Club" "Old Mom Cake" Group" and so on... non-professional women's organizations such as these. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just because he had inserted his hand, Boa. Douglas’s plan had failed before he started. The black-haired, blue-eyed boy was too angry – he wanted to form a club himself – he had to join this. It sounds like a so-called sissy so-called cultivation, so that he can use the land and equipment in a bright and straightforward way - to make him even more boring, on the second day, Lila joined the cultivation committee. If the association belongs to Boa, he can certainly refuse Lila, but it belongs to Chennike. Boa did not dare to go to his father. If Fergus Douglas knew that he wanted to take Ossien to eat the rest of the leftovers, he had to interrupt his two feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha. Hopkins let Lila enter the cultivation society, is to wake up this bad little mixed ball - also see what he wants What to do, there are enough things in Poseidon Island, no need to add a Boa. Douglas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this for Dr. Hopkins?" Bu looked at the lavender that was big enough to cover Lila's entire upper body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at Hopkins, a small purple spike on the boy’s shirt pocket: "It looks like you are a little pitiful, brother." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Eat it," said Little Hopkins, handing over a small paper bag that is no smaller than a bouquet, filled with golden-colored fat fried chicken. , cheese pie, and lemon soda with ice cubes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The karaokemen’s meal today is beef, but for Besib, a forty-eight ounce steak can only be said to be “hot”. Extra food, he and Chekal. Like the mulberry, always hold the enthusiasm of fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a little nervousness in the recent coaching. Besib thought that yesterday’s training content was increased, and today it is even worse. They are more than two late. It was only after hours that he was allowed to leave the "barbeque rack". In the training of the whole team of four people running the pass, they almost could not see the ball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three people walk along the Grand River, broken migratory grass, cress and rush grass grow vigorously, the flowering period of the trumpet daffodil is long over, only the rest The dark green leaves in the shape of a clump of daggers, the golden ochre of the palms, the fleshy water lilies and the long-flowered sages with three-petal white flowers, the verbena of the five-petal florets are hot, the tough reeds in the river Derived into a kingdom, gray and yellow, light and soft, like a cloud floating on the green river. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
