			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas and Hopkins met. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grand boarding school has very strict restrictions on students going out, students want to go out of school (even on weekends), generally only these Situations - First, teachers lead them out to do extracurricular activities or competitions; Second, volunteers for small town residents must also have two teachers to follow; Third, as we have described before, outstanding students can be allowed to I spent a few hours in the town, but I have to come back on time and be safe. 4. Parents can also get the permission of the school during the weekend without a course and activities (this is almost impossible), with their children. Go out to play, take a break, take a break, eat something delicious - Grande has set up a reception hall for this purpose, the grade instructor with the parents' personal application letter and the students waiting for the parents, the parents came They must sign a statement with the student’s school time and return time. During this time, any accidental school is irresponsible. Parents are not only responsible. Shoulding the supervisory responsibility and returning to the child on time, over time or causing any trouble, the student will be warned or a note will be posted by the teacher, who will be attached to the file if they are prepared in the future. If you apply for a good university, this is very unfavorable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps God, no, more likely to be the devil's will, Anthony Hopkins and Fergus Douglas at the ends of a long table Signed, their children followed behind them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Douglas family leader recognized the boy with moonlight hair at first sight. Anyway, his purple eyes are too rare. The appearance and height are impeccable. His wife stood beside him and raised his finger to cover his lips: "It’s rare to see a child who is more handsome than our Bo," she commented with enthusiasm. "I am more beautiful than the photo, um. Dear, time is back seven hundred years, and he can be unprofitable with this face alone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If he is facing a woman like you - I don't deny this." Mr. Douglas said without changing his color: "After all, the child is still a popular entertainment at the time, and it is not strictly prohibited by law. Inside." His heart is bored, and sooner or later he will find a way to get rid of this woman... He knows that someone describes her as a blooming flower - because she is not rejected, black, white, mixed blood , man, woman, old man, child, like Flowers never refused to fly insects on the core - her greed but dirty, is simply a bottomless quagmire. He pushed her gently, using only his fingertips, as if he had to touch something that made him sick. "Good evening," he stared at Dr. Hopkins, staring at him: "I am Douglas - Fergus Douglas. Please forgive me. I heard about your last name, Hopkins, this It’s an old surname,” said Hopkins University, one of the most famous medical schools in the Western Confederation. He couldn’t help but ask if Hopkins had anything to do with it. This is a catastrophe that the lower elders will do: "You have a good, healthy and beautiful child. The teachers praised and praised us all." He reached out and said: " I also have a child who is in the 10th grade in Grande."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins smiled at the tiny white teeth, polite, he also extended his hand: "Good evening. Mr. Douglas. I am Anthony Hopkins." He looked at the people around Douglas. . <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; two men's hands in together, Hopkins's hand very cool, slender fingers. And Douglas's hand was thick and wide, and his hands were hot. They were separated when they touched it slightly. This is a bit out of the ordinary, but when they do it at the same time, it doesn't matter whether it is reasonable or not. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; ". Linda let me introduce you to Dr. Hopkins ......" Douglas said. Pay attention to each other's response, "Dr. Hopkins, this is my wife, Linda Douglas, as well as our children, Boa Douglas..." <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Linda Douglas rose slightly purple lips, lifted her up, took off her gloves and held out his hand:.. "a great honor, Dr. Hopkins" <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp Anthony Hopkins took her fingertips and lowered her head. His breath swept over Mrs. Douglas's delicate and delicate back, but she didn't touch her skin, no matter what her lips or anything else. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Mrs. Douglas could see him sort of warm silk chaos, the silver-gray hair, his gentle looked up, her eyes and smiled when His mouth is blue and gray, more beautiful, noble and elegant than Douglas's yellow eyes. His nose is sharp, his face is thin, and his thin lips are full of blood. Linda noticed that Dr. Hopkins was dressed in a dress that fits her taste – a zinc-white linen shirt, unlocked the first button, no tie, and the neckline is neat, the button is made of shells. But it has been polished to make it less shiny, black cotton windbreaker, no pockets, dull colors, trousers of the same color, God bless, no hanging at the waist, glasses case, keychain, commemorative card , or something else... the part that covers the upper is just right. His watch is worn on the right hand, the strap is black lizard skin, there is no second hand on the surface, Mrs. Douglas can't see his other hand, but It is conceivable that the ring will never be worn, but because he already has a son relationship, there should be a wedding ring. I hope there is no diamond or diamond pattern on it, otherwise everything will be destroyed. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;. Fogs Douglas hanging on his wife's waist, she quietly took a step back, but his experience before her unbridled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have to tell the truth, he does feel the threat from another male. Just like his Boa hate Sasha Hopkins, Ferguson can also be sure that he does not like Anthony Hopkins. This man has long been on Douglas's blacklist, and now his ranking has climbed to a very good high in a short period of time - almost second only to his younger brother, Osien Douglas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is really a doctor? Ferguson thought very uncomfortably. It should be that his information stated that he is a consulting psychologist. To do this in the Western continent, he must have a master's degree or above and more than 3,000 years of clinical experience, and Related professional qualification examinations and tests, the elimination rate is said to be very high, but if you are, you can get a very good position and a lot of income in society. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone has a psychiatrist, everyone in the Douglas family has a certain reputation, and the fees are high, Ferguson Douglas does not believe These will only make you sleep and look at the sun, the guy who is enchanted by ghosts, but he must have, this is a symbol, a configuration, like a horse and a yacht. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Linda Douglas smiles indifferently under the mild epidermis. The type she likes is often her husband’s dislike because he can never be his heart. The way I really like it - Ferguson is not liked by parents in juvenile and youth, because somehow his appearance and body are always different from those of the upper class. His face is red and like A Scottish brewer, when he is sunbathing a little, will become dark, which makes him like a grape. His body is too strong. It is the so-called "athlete" figure. This figure may be there. The group is stunned (the son gets an exclamation, but it is not suitable for wearing a tuxedo or a three-piece suit, because the inflated muscles will try to plug every place, no matter how good the craftsmanship is.) - Many times, Mr. Foggs Douglas was mistaken for a bodyguard or a chef by a discerning, poorly memoryd waiter. This is really tragic, isn't it?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;So When choosing a spouse, I would like to specify these items: the body is weak, pale, pure and innocent, with a poetry-like melancholy temperament. It is best to have a knight, but it is not good. The ancestors have a knight who can also satisfy these. Women have been relaxed in terms of personal assets - many people say she is a lucky one, she has less than one percent of Douglas's wealth, before she can't afford her estate - she married Forgues, all problems are solved.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
