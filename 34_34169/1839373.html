			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The computer is still a bit problematic - this chapter is in the company code, yesterday half chapter, today half chapter - less and promised will certainly make up, sorry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forgus Douglas took his son, Boa. Douglas went to the ninth grade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, he was crazy about Miss Marcia, who had a big waist. His father thought that his aesthetics needed to be corrected. He chose Boa. One, she is only fifteen years old, but she has been doing popular for three years. Her aunt is her grandmother, the pimp is her father, and she receives more than a dozen guests per night - so experienced; Douglas clearly remembers how she couldn't lie on the bed of artificial silk, the little ** and the brown ** straight to the ceiling; she smiled at the treasure and turned over Show him his hips, her hips are also unnatural, tight circles, tattoos on her back, a devil perched on the butterfly bone, the tail hangs from the spine, all the way down In the middle of the seam. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is my mark and my name," she said flatterly. "Come here, saying that it is right to find a long tail and a little devil." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Mr. Douglas heard about the incident, he smiled and sneered with thick lips, "Boa," he said: "Many will do this." Because their faces and names are not remembered, you will encounter more little devils and little angels in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said It must be done, spring break, summer vacation, Christmas or Thanksgiving. He traveled a quarter of the western continent with Boa, which made him a lot of knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forgus Douglas chose almost all of the women who had big cocks and big ass, some could be Bo's sister, some could do Boa's aunt, there are some grandmothers who can do Boa. In the pink round bed waiting for this young man, in addition to women, there are boys who were castrated at the age of **, or males were removed from surgery by adulthood to regenerate with nerves and blood vessels. Artificial **. Take a lot of female hormones and break the monster that plugs the silicone into the chest. Fergus Douglas also asked if his son was interested in trying pregnant women and babies. After getting a negative answer, he laughed at Boa. Douglas was a useless species. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one can say that Foggs Douglas is not doing enough in this respect, but his actions only once again aroused Bo's dislike and rejection of other women. He was arrogant in front of the stern father. He was obedient like a rabbit, so he did what he did, but as soon as Ferguson raised his hand, he would immediately flee to Grande and plunged into the thick legs of Miss Marcia. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He’s love for Marcia is so fast, fierce and profound, as well, when it leaves, it’s just so crisp, without a trace of it. Hesitant. Boa sometimes looks for images of Miss Marcia in her memories. The images are blurry. I can barely call it clear only the fingers that are coated with inferior nail polish. When the vines dragged Marcia like a hippo. Her body dragged to the ground as she walked forward. It is like an octopus foot leaking from the net pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that moment, Boa. Douglas’s hatred of Marcia, along with the remaining love and admiration, screamed and disappeared without a trace. They ran so far that they could not find the way back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ugly dead, Marcia." Boa. Douglas said to her in memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he is throwing a lost old shirt that has forgotten in the cupboard, throwing Marcia to a distant place that cannot be touched and searched . Single-mindedly toward his new lover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boo. Douglas' new lover - she has not studied at university, has been left for a long time or has no home, has been passed, She has also been violently hurting others and has therefore gone to jail. She is now working in an institution. For most unwitting laymen, serving such a concealed and deformed, “unfair” organization is worse than being an unemployed – even if it’s an ordinary person, it’s hard to accept it like this. A girl becomes a part of the family, and public opinion loves money. The vanity and arrogance of Mr. Foggs Douglas and the ex-wife who had already divorced him, but still brazenly used his family name and credit card, but still proud of his noble blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The news of Mr. Foggs Douglas is very well-informed, just as Boa’s fourth day of paying attention to his new swimming team coach’s “too much” He received a thick parcel with information about Catherine Stallin, with many photos, including her in prison, shaved hair, put on striped prison clothes, and looked at the camera insensitive Those few, and her coercion or voluntariness (in exchange for shelter or food) in a long-term wandering career, the set of photographs, will expose the exposed nude parts of the private part; another medical record, It shows that she has received psychotherapy, the therapist thinks she is violent, very dangerous; there is also a medical record - and the follow-up drugs, Catherine Stalin is a hen that can only lay eggs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person who sent the parcel made a mistake. This is not Boa. Douglas will go to care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He only cares about his love. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man walked through the corridor along the thick, but beautifully resembling the vulgar carpet, more than a year ago, the head of the organization and His subordinates met in this room with the ghoul Dr. Anthony Hopkins. The first time Catherine and Boa met were in this place. Catherine was almost the first when she needed to choose a safe meeting place. Time has come to mind here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baoer gently pushes the door, the door is hidden, there is no lock, he picks up the door and "Do not disturb" sign, hanging on the door On the handle, walk into the room and close the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine Stallin sat on a chair in the middle of the room, the moonlight came in through the window, the light beam projected at her feet, she wore a pair of black high heels today. Opened a deep v-shaped mouth, revealing a white, with a light blue blood vessel on the instep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She raised her hand when Boa was two steps away from her, indicating that he had already entered the first cordon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let me go a little more." Boa said, "I want to sniff the smell of your body." Catherine has rarely applied perfume. Because her thoughts will be disturbed by the smell of perfume, it is likely to cause an interpretation error - Boa said that she can smell the smell on her, but she can only smell the smell of sweat and gasoline, if the gun is opened, There are also gunpowder and sulphur flavors, or cigarettes, ketchup and roast chicken flavors that are contaminated in restaurants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can get closer," Catherine said. "Let me meet you - yes, yes, a little bit, well, enough. I can already meet you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's not enough," Boa said seriously: "I need to kiss you."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." Catherine said: "No kiss, we said yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So a hug, Boa said patiently: "Like a friend."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine endured with no scornful and angry expression, she never thought that one wanted to kill The person who died her only relatives in this world would be her friend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
