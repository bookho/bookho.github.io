			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The car fell from a cliff or somewhere else, crashed, burned out, and this is also the favorite method used by Poseidon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high temperatures generated by the burning of gasoline, the plastics that melted by heat, rubber and artificial leather, and the deformed carbonized body can annihilate almost all evidence—blood, fingerprints, Hair, spots, etc., you can not find traces of abuse or rape in them, it is difficult to find out their cause of death, even in a moment, you can't even understand their identity. Wait until you finally make a little progress - there will be a dozen people to testify that this is just an accident - your boss will give you another case, and hint that you have to raise your salary recently, you'd better get it up as soon as possible. The notebook that records the testimony, the nephew of the search for evidence, the brain of the case... The case is closed, and it doesn't matter to you, or any one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The child was determined not to be Constantine. Crovin's?" Besib asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even if," Sasha said: "Just because he has such a mother, he can't live. His mother is an unfaithful person, one, The Cloven family loves face, a leader, or a future leader who has such a birth and will be ashamed of them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems like the gang has a lot of scorpions It is noble." Beppe said that on the sea god island, men who go to work outside will have a wife, and they generally will not allow the wife to give them a baby, but there are always times when they are sparse. If it is a girl, they will give it to her biological mother and give him a large sum of money; if it is a boy, he will take him back to Poseidon Island and give it to his mother, aunt or sister to raise - must explain In any case, the mother of this child will never be related to him anymore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last one was a boy, and the identity of Besib’s mother was not so bright, but the rules of the sea gods were children with their father. A man is willing to give a boy a surname. He admitted that he is his own son. He has the same rights and obligations as the other boys in the whole family, perhaps the only difference. It is difficult for him to obtain any powerful care and help from the nominal "mother" - human nature, a woman who loves his husband, and will not be linked to the living evidence of his betrayal of himself and his family. Love. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Besib will definitely want to marry a girl on the island of Poseidon. Although Chekale has no wife than Sangdi, because of this, Besib needs more support - little Hopkins, he You can talk about love, have one or two girlfriends, but he can never marry a girl from the Western continent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Lila appeared, Bep was still a little worried. However, he soon found himself thinking more, the girl's hobby was different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this enough?" he asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Enough," Sasha said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ramie blooms throughout the year and bears fruit, but it is the most vigorous breeding season from the end of September to the beginning of October. The red and blue thorny little fruit looks quite Lovely. Inside, there are highly poisonous, black seeds, and a few metallic lustrous blue beetles mate on the deep green broad leaves. Two boys pass through the castor, and the castor leaves sway vigorously. The beetle Do not move, continue to do their big things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Men..." Beppe said with a sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They are back," Hopkins said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He and Chekal Bissand are waiting for the children in the kitchen - adhering to the "Ghoul" style. The kitchen of the house has been enlarged, it occupies half of the restaurant, the original furniture and equipment Hopkins has only left a large chopping board made of whole tree roots, which can be a small full-footed tail The sheep were placed on top and the others were all thrown away - instead, two professional stoves that could be stewed, boiled, grilled and fried at the same time; equipped with five heavy-sized pans. The colander for cooking noodles, the medium-sized soup pot, the large copper pot that can be placed in front of the lamb, and the small pot that can only warm a cup of goat milk; the old-fashioned oven with a stupid style but an amazing volume. There are also two; the knife with the black handle protruding from the stainless steel knife holder is heavy, light, wide, narrow... neat and sharp, sharp and sturdy; small wood-cut chopping board with cheese color; A condiment bottle and a spice jar calculated in drawers; two double-door refrigerators; a pantry; the center of the kitchen is a marble tabletop for cutting and kneading, which is larger than the six-seat dining table that people usually have. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to Chegal and Anthony Hopkins, there are still a few people who are commanders of the Sangdi family, iron hoes, consultants, agents Lawyers, staff officers and other important figures, as well as Father Peter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have been drinking, eating cheese, pears and peaches. The discussion of adults has come to an end, and the next thing the children have to know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins prepared a rainbow cake about two feet in diameter with white cream on top and chocolate crumbs on it, each layer inside Sandwiched with fragrant 榛 jam. Anthony Hopkins did not use food coloring when making it, and each color was taken from fruits or vegetables. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Give me a piece first." Chegaler. Bissand said bluntly, then he looked at the people inside the house, they cut Galle is very respectful, but it is not necessarily for Besib. Some people question whether Bishb. Bissau should be involved in family affairs at this age. They think that it would be more appropriate when Bishop is 20 years old. - He is still a big boy now, although he has passed the test and made two sales, but these are all done under the guidance and help of Chegaler. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Sasha Hopkins, they are equally full of doubts, maybe one day in the future, this beautiful boy will be with one of their daughters. Marry, in order to become a trusted Poseidon Islander, but that is the future thing - the Poseidon Island people can never entrust their lives and families to an outsider, even if he is a god or a demon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Celegal.Bissand knows what they are thinking, but the people here, except Anthony Hopkins and Father Peter, he Will not be handed over to Besib. Just like they don’t believe in a non-Poseidon Island, he doesn’t believe in any ordinary person. The team of Besib. Bissau is not here—he just needs to be optimistic about these people, paralyze them, ten years, or five years. Just like the parents of the family. He will send them to death before Besib Bissance takes over the scepter in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The men’s seats are arranged around the kitchen, and the children’s seats are close to Chegaler’s sangdi, Dr. Hopkins Station And cut them for them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are things about the North." Father Peter said: "We have something new."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp "Mrs. Crowe won," said the commander of the Sangdi family. He controlled the army of the Sangdi family: "The speed of lightning is too fast, the firepower of the wind and the rain is reasonable and timely. Staffing, generous buying and bribery, she succeeded, she took control of one hundred and seventy miles north of Orlosa."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Do you include that new diamond mine?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Of course.” Father Peter said: “Otherwise, the work she had done before was in vain.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How much is that diamond mine worth?" The staff asked: "I saw it worth $100 billion in the newspaper."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They can't develop it all at once, so the diamond will be greatly devalued." The commander said: "They may build a new city there, gradually in 30 years. Dig and sell diamonds."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Talk to us about the diamond mine," said Chegaler to the attorney. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will simply say it." The attorney said: "Look at this cake." He raised a small silver fork: "The earth's structure is very It's a bit like a rainbow cake, the outermost is the surface, the thickness is between zero and sixty-two miles," the fork opened the layer of cream, "the next is the cellar." The fork counts the cake, one layer, two layers, three layers, four The layer, "thickness is about 1,800 miles, and the thickness of the diamond formation is about one hundred miles. That is, the outer periphery of the mantle, outside the surface, and the deepest place where humans can drill, is only 7.5 miles. So, if you want to get diamonds directly, it’s impossible to do things at this stage – we can now see diamonds, most of which are attributed to the magma flowing down the mantle, struggling along the cracks in the magma. At the time, they carry a lot of things, including rock formations containing diamonds. It must be fast, otherwise the diamond is likely to be converted into graphite due to pressure changes during the ascent..." He paused for a moment, because There are several people whose eyes have begun to stun, scatter, and with a little bit of unspeakable pain. "In short, the eruption stops, the magma carrying the diamond forms a conical funnel, which is what we often say." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, the northern nephew got a big bobbin." Iron hoe with a "wow, I am really smart" look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attorney endured a bit: "No," he said as eagerly as he said: "The diamond mine north of Orlosa was not produced this way. It is a crater, the diamond inside is caused by the huge pressure and high temperature generated by a huge comet colliding with the Earth 35 million years ago, which may have exactly a graphite mine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then why do you want to tell us about the cheese?" Iron Taro asked in confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because it is the largest mining conglomerate in the world that relies on those packages, it uses the diamond sales organization to control the global sale of diamonds." The lawyer said that the others nodded, and they could understand. "They hoard diamonds. When they are less, they sell more. When they are more, they sell less." Commander said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But now there is a place where you can dig out more diamonds." Chegal said: "And they can't control it."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So 'those people' can't keep the mines in those big areas." The attorney said: "With this diamond pit, they will immediately leave the federal - Fortunately, that place has always been a controversial area."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So what about Mrs. Crowe?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "The areas controlled by the Croven family are very poor, very poor, or have been tossed by war. They have far fewer resources than the large northern regions - the diamond pits of Orlosa have dried up. We only saw a dredger (a special vehicle for diamond excavation) there, which was specially used for tourists to take pictures. Their coal, oil, natural gas and forests are also fast. They are the most people now.” Father Peter Said: "Even if you have the diamond mine, the Cloven family is left with only the lingering, they are "Don't dare to leave the Union."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The diamond mine," said the commander: "How much benefit can we get?" He really couldn't understand why Discuss this: "We are too far away from it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you think?" Chegal said, "Bishb, you have been there." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No benefit," Besib said smoothly: "There is only a bad thing." When everyone’s eyes are focused on him, the boy is not exposed. The flustered look came: "The Cloven family is a wow-called puppies for the federation, but if they really get the diamond mine, for us, it’s a strong, strong, hungry The wolf is going crazy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commander and Iron Taro, staff. The attorney immediately remembered the arms of the entire plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They have already got the diamond mine." The commander said: "Where do we have a way to blow up?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Only fissile weapons can deal with that big pit." Sibu said: "If we can do that, we don't need to worry about the Cloven family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We have to do something," said the commander. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Speak, listen," said the staff. "Do you have any idea? I think you have it." He smiled at Chegal. A moment: "Let's talk, we listen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have a document here," Sasha said. "I can't tell how I got it." But I can guarantee that it is real."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that the little guys are ready." The commander did not maliciously ridiculed: "I can't wait I want to see it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attorney took a copy and read it down. There are many professional terms in it, even he looks A little hard work. So he once again assumed the responsibility of translation: "They said - all the diamonds in this diamond mine have a reserve that is ten times larger than the sum of the world's known diamond reserves..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not good news." Iron Taro said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Diamond hardness is twice that of ordinary diamonds." The attorney said: "...because of this unique physical property, they are more suitable for high-precision technology. And the industrial market."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He blinked: "Oh, I seem to have understood it a bit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!" Iron smashed the road, while pouring himself a glass of wine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is buying diamonds?" The attorney asked himself: "Women."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Big mistakes." Commander complained: "It's a woman's man - look at my mother, date to diamond, engagement to diamond, marriage is more necessary, and this or that anniversary, birthday, Valentine's Day Christmas, Passover, Easter... You can't go home for dinner, buy a diamond; you sleep with a scorpion, buy a diamond; you humiliate your wife, buy a diamond; you fire up and beat her Buy a diamond... Diamond is omnipotent, it is a panacea – women are simply living for it.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...so," said the attorney. "Imagine that when women cheered for more diamonds, suddenly someone jumped out and said to them. Sorry, ladies, ladies, these diamonds are not Suitable for embellishing your ears, forehead, neck and wrist, it is only suitable for use in aircraft precision parts, wear-resistant bearings and drill bits, or glass knives."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh," the consultant shook his head sadly: "They will immediately be interested."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They can sell diamonds to the factory." "Iron Taro said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A price with synthetic diamonds?" said the consultant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iron Taro made a "understand" gesture, he was not interested in learning since he was a child - but many of the members of "Masoye" They are all "three-balls with the sub-system" (referring to pawnshops). They sometimes play tricks of Li Daitao, such as using synthetic cubic zirconia as a diamond, garnet, fluorite, emerald, red Spinel pretending to be ruby ​​and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, when do we throw this document out?" The consultant looked at Chekal Bissand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Try to get Konstantin Cloven to get the document." Besib said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He is also a member of the Cloven family." The consultant said that he is still the leader of the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We will try to bring a funny little news." Father Peter said that he did not expect the card to be played out every few days, he I have thought about changing it for something else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If this little news didn't work," the consultant said, if Constantine Cloven was not as stupid as they thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then we don't have this document in hand." Besib said: "If Constantine didn't move in forty-eight hours, we put it The message was released."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Celegal. Bisangdi never talked. He heard this and he swallowed a large piece of cake with satisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't want to know the source of this document, it's not that important," said the consultant. "But I can know, 'those people' know Is this something?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
