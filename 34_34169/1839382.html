			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bissib’s roommate is an active and cheerful black guy, tall and thin, with fluffy hair and a flat nose. The distance before the eyes can be stuffed into A palm, dark skin is like a piece of charred wood, he is really not beautiful, but still very flattering - he is very busy doing work, everyone is still busy with their bed At the time of the wardrobe and the desk, he was already cleaning and decorating the common living room and bathroom - the bathroom was cleaned by a special cleaner, but it was kept clean, and he installed a sticky type of insect repellent next to the toilet. On the marble countertop of the washstand, a glass bottle with a lead block fixed at the bottom of the bottle was placed with a few colorful sweet potato flowers. After the consent of the roommates, he still walked to the bathroom in the living room. The wall is equipped with a delicate and unique line of lights, with infrared sensors, so that the guy who gets up at night to go to the bathroom does not have to fumble to open the ceiling and table lamps, or bring a flashlight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only two slightly dry cushions in the common living room sofa, so he generously took a half-feeling velvet pillow from his room, but Besib suspected that the hand-made pillows of different colors and shapes were his mother's handwriting, and he just found the best way to expel the fluffy guests who occupied his entire bed without permission. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is called Quinta, with the same name as the protagonist, but he said the name comes from his great-grandfather, this is the tradition of black people, they give their children the same as their ancestors The name, because in their minds, the child is the reincarnation of the ancestors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So," Quinta said: "When a black man is sold as a slave and his master calls him Toby or Angelia, he is How sad and unbearable," he said, exaggeratingly making a sad expression. "But now some people have named their children Moe, Lexus and even Toyota. It's ridiculous. Is their ancestor a bottle of champagne. Is it a car? This is a violation of tradition," he concluded. "I am writing a related paper - about the loss of our culture, that's it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was disappointed to tell Besib when he introduced himself. And Sasha. He originally wanted to apply for seven bedrooms - the largest suite in the entire college building, with three connected living rooms, two bathrooms and kitchens, and men who can apply for that suite according to unwritten Manchester law. Students must each organize a dance party on the last weekend of each month. But it is a pity that he is not fast enough. Although he submitted the dormitory application form in the second week after receiving the acceptance letter, he has already ranked more than 100. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you think he will give up?" Besib asked quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How come?" Sasha said: "The dance is a compulsory course for every college student."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When he looked at us, his eyes sparkled like a deer buck." Besib murmured: "I am worried that we will become the most important part of this compulsory course." One of the references."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You want to tell me that you can't cope with this?" His golden-haired brother said mercilessly: "You want to tell me." In the four years of Grande, are you doing homework with a beautiful girl every night?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is two different things," Bu retorted: "The feeling of being a hunter and prey is a different day."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That would be a compulsory assignment," Sasha Said: "To the roommate. The students and the teachers left an impression of being solitary and autistic that it is failing - in addition, we are not good at this," he sighed, he, and Besib, Plus proficient in battle with planning, robbery or murder, but always difficult. Well, how do you say it, like a normal person, indulge in carnival and alcohol, because for identity-sensitive, this can be fatal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The biggest problem has arisen, one is always calm. The sensible and powerful leaders, whether on the court or on the battlefield, are many people who can't ask for it. So, what about the dance? Let's talk about the organizers of the ball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They will learn to do it. But before that, as an assistant and watcher, let's take a look at it for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, along with alcohol, there is nothing to complain about as a small gift to attract girls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plan, Besib will enter the Manchester football team, his score is not as high as Sasha, but Grande is in his three years of enrollment In it, he won three championships. He did not receive an offer letter, but an invitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manchester has a dead end, in all respects, the most prominent point is the football game, they will come together every year in the big school league. It’s not a football game. It’s a battle of honor between two world-renowned universities. Even the old alumni who have been away from school for nearly 50 years will take the family to watch the battle. Manchester has had a few very good players, a good captain, but unfortunately they are all about to graduate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It’s hard to imagine,” Besib said. “Like Grand, Manchester is a university!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The top three universities,” Sasha said: "But if you think that the university is so valued in its rugby league results, Grand, and other high schools, why bother to look at a football team?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Sasha relies on his transcripts and trophies, swimming competitions, special makeup competitions, drama competitions, and ancient musical instruments - this is not a game, but a simple The performance of the show, he played in the concert hall for tens of thousands of audiences, also played in the square for the bustling passengers, and also went to the prison to play for the criminals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry," Quinta sticks a head out from the door. "Do I have troubles you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp "No," Sasha said, standing up from the chair, Besib was from the bed, this room was small and could not fit the third chair, regardless of whether it was Besib or Sasha. I don't like to use other people's things, especially without the owner's permission. "We have finished."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Great," Quinta said: "Hey... Hopkins?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sasha."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sasha, can you go to the administrator? He asked me to bring a Message - It seems like something is going to ask for your help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will go right away." Sasha said, "Thank you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins walked past the black boy, Quinta smelled a cold mint flavor, he had a fashionable mother, so although he liked it The perfume of citrus and tobacco smell, but also know which kinds of men's eau de toilette will be minty, in the perfume world. There are not many mints used as raw materials. For example, the ratio of mint to the position that can not be ignored is even less, and it is also a good perfume. The biggest possibility is “water of Artisan”. "The top model masterpiece." He said in his heart: "But it's a bit wrong."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for his ** people, he likes the blues, one Marine eau de toilette. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Chegaler than Santander and Anthony Hopkins are strolling across the vast campus of Manchester as a kingdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone they meet is trying to control, not letting themselves reveal a sullen expression of surprise - more than Sangdi’s fat makes people wonder why he can Walking instead of creeping like a jelly ball on the ground, he even took a whole road when passing through some trails, and several students looked at him with concern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins heard someone discussing whether to rent a wheelchair for this gentleman, and those who disagreed expressed that it would be difficult to have a wheelchair This stunning masterpiece of humanity/nature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manchester's lawns and trees in August are mostly green, but the depths are different. The small part is turned into a bright red like fire, a yellow tinge of gold or both, and some have a gold-green, red-green gradient color. The buildings on campus look like Gothic or Georgian, some of which are modern steel structures. Outside, there are marbles that have been pickled, burnt and aged. The glass windows have been intentionally broken, and then they are decorated in a medieval way. The doors and window frames are also made of wood and black iron and bronze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They stop in front of a cathedral-like building. It is the largest of the twenty-two libraries in Manchester, with two floors, and several freshmen are taking photos with their relatives in front of the building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are eight presidents and vice presidents who have described this library in their memoirs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Hopkins met an acquaintance here, Chegal. Bisangdi looked at the black woman who came over to talk to the doctor, and he Shake your hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a black woman who looks unremarkable from the outside. It’s not so much a petite but a short fat. Wearing an orange-red suit, a small dome hat of the same color, with a jade pin, with olive-green shoes, so jumping and contrasting contrast is not good for the average person. It is very lining her dark skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is Phyllis Winston?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
