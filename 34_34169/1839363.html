			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two hundred and eighty chapters have been added to three thousand three hundred words...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** *<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it a dog?" A girl asked with timidity: "Is it still?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "If it is a dog, then it must have ten powerful fingers." Lila said coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mumbai cat is standing between the body of his wife and the child, it only screams, and the sound is like a stab into the heart, copper The colored eyes shine in the last rays of the sun today, and it gaze at the human beings, just like searching for the shadows of the devil among them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the flat-faced kitten has become slower and lighter, but it is still screaming, and the all-black Mumbai cat walks calmly to it. Look at its eyes, then the two broken legs, these two legs are torn, there is no hope of picking up, only to the doctor to amputate, and the blood is dripping, ready to leave the body chin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mumbai cat opened his mouth, as if to pick up the only living child - no, it didn't do that, it snapped Flat face kitten's neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kitten is no longer called. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lila came back with a suppressed scream, and several girls raised their hands to cover their eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mumbai cat jumped into the dry reeds and disappeared in a blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The school’s cleaners buried the mother cat and the kitten, and the blood and dirt on the boardwalk were cleaned up – the school’s guards were strengthened, especially girls. Dormitory, lower grade students are also warned that they cannot go to those remote corners or abandoned warehouses alone. The teacher’s family (the teachers living in the student dormitory and their family members) will start to confirm whether each child is at 7:00 pm. They all stayed in their room, and the library was closed two hours earlier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The school board also informed the Grand Town Bureau of the matter, and the children of Grande often saw the police car passing slowly from a distance. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even so, some timid children will still try to accompany the action, Grande is too big, especially in the late autumn and winter nights, night falls so fast, just like someone in the sky shut down the lights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second cat that was reclaimed was found after twenty-four hours. It was hung on the tree, and the upper jaw was hooked by a thick fish hook. The chest and abdomen were empty, and the internal organs that fell on the ground were eaten by rats and donkeys. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next step is a dog. A gray-colored Labrador Retriever, Labrador is a medium-sized dog, and the teachers and students have fed it, knowing that it was a healthy and responsive dog before death, but even so, No one heard the last whine of it - the veterinarian gave it a check to prove that it was half dead by a rope or an iron chain, and then poked dozens of holes by things like barbecue iron and iron. "The murderer The strength is great.” The veterinarian said, “I can pass through those holes. Do you understand? These holes are symmetrical, and the bastard pierces it.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Grand's school board is very reluctant to let the formal involvement in this matter, but things have reached this point, it can be said that it is out of control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps the arrival and investigation deterred the criminal, he stopped for a few days. On another Thursday, a skinny white cat stretched out its claws from the dirt, and people dug it out. It was piece by piece. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avery’s alumni sighed, learning life was boring enough, and now there’s another madman who can’t get through the four-legged beast. In a small dormitory. It’s too sad to have a date when my girlfriend’s date is limited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He used his eyes to reach his big roommate and walked out of the bathroom. His face was scratched, soaked in water, and the wound swollen. Also whitish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, he would recommend Avery to go to the infirmary to take some medicine. But since he was beaten by Avery last time, he is not very willing to talk to him. How to say it, today's Avery, gives the impression that it is a wet gunpowder barrel. No one knows when it will dry, and then slams all the things around him into the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avery fell on the bed and fell asleep soon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He woke up at four in the morning, his roommate was screaming in bed - Avery’s roommate was also a fan of “smart medicine” After the drug was collected, he could not sleep naturally. He could only go to the infirmary to open sleeping pills, so Avery was not afraid that he suddenly woke up and found his bed was empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The window of the dormitory is only two feet wide, but Avery can still squeeze out. His room is on the second floor. Below is a cluster of well-growing ryegrass. It is hard to see the traces of this grass being trampled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avery jumped out of the window, through the ryegrass, and ran to the woods by the river. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grande’s ownerless cats and dogs live near the feeding point, just as the tramp will be close to relief stations and churches, and they are almost unsuspecting to humans. Avery has a dried meat in the pocket on the left, and a heavy-duty stainless steel utility knife in the pocket on the right, and a golden enamel Kevlar rope in the waterproof jacket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t know why he was doing this kind of thing—he only knew that he was upset that day, he couldn’t sleep, so he sneaked away. Come out and think of the river to blow the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cow-colored female cat and her four kittens also strolled on the boardwalk, when half of his pocket was forgotten to eat. The sausage, he pulled it out, shattered it and sprinkled it on the ground, and greeted the kittens to come over to eat it - but his kindness was ruthlessly despised, the kittens and the mother cat smelled around the sausage, and they didn’t taste it. - Like his teammates, after being driven out of the rugby team, he still holds a glimmer of hope. He goes to see them with fried chicken and soda, and wants them to help say a word or two. He dare not continue. Luxury position for the quarterback, as long as he can return to the team, the winger can also do, free guard can also, even if it is a substitute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they just looked at him with difficulty and pity, without saying a word, the soda became hot, and the fried chicken became cold, no one wanted to take a piece As if he would sprinkle poison on it, he took them across half of the campus and threw them into the trash can in front of the dormitory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the class, the teacher no longer asks him to answer questions, and the questions he asks can only be answered in a perfunctory way. The students avoid him as if he had What a strong infectious disease, his friends and he said sorry - rolling your mother's sorry - Avery understands, understands that Grande is forced to leave him, those high school members and principals The consultant teacher and the director of training were humiliated and coerced by a pair of vulgar farmers and peasants. They can allow him to appear in front of the eyes. It is already the eleventh wonder of the world. Besides this, he does not want to catch a little bit. benefit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s hard to be awkward, but he has to stick to it, there’s no better school than Grande willing to accept an eleventh grader with a good character, he The results are not outstanding, leaving Grande, he can only go to public schools, where he can not apply to the university he wants to enter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there is hope now, there is at least hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He woke up in the fierce attack of the mother cat, his hands were hot and sticky, a kitten was knocked off his legs, and his mouth That is a flat-faced kitten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s crazy, he doesn’t want to be scratched by a cat, he remembers that he seems to have stepped on its belly, like stepping on a full of water Rubber bag - When the cat's belly burst, the internal organs and blood stained his boots, which made him more angry and annoyed. He caught the remaining three kittens in the grass, screwed their heads down and put them on. Next to their mother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His body is full of skunk blood, Avery had to jump into the Grand River to take a cold shower, he went back to the dormitory After eating a cold medicine, he was safely asleep for the first time after being found out of illegal drugs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then is the second, the third, the fourth...the way he is more skillful and calmer than once, calm and good mentality to let him face The routine inquiry is not flustered - if he can have such performance when checking the drug, it would be fine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avery is also aware that their eyes are still outside the school, he heard from the teacher, suspected that the tramp or addict is doing something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former rugby team smiled sarcastically in the darkness, oh, this is Grande. Grande students are not suspected, even if they have just been found to have 60% of them relying on prescription drugs to live. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He found the goal of today with no effort, a fertile beige curly cat, who concentrated on the first before dawn. Meal - a broken bird's egg, the process of catching it does not have the slightest description and description of the value. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black cat, which is almost integrated with the night, follows humans. It smells the blood of his wife and children. He ambushes on the avenue. He, but he is too big, it can only watch him escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avery went to the river and he was ready to kill the cat alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black cat is behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black cat arched his back and stared at the white neck that Avery had when he lowered his head. The cats knew how to bite the cervical spine of the prey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
