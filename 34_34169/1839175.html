			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come on, Sasha!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The children shouted like this, they are almost all The red body is immersed in the warm sea, only the neck and the head are exposed. The sea is so clear and clear that the sand can clearly see those small but densely covered in the dark brown or light brown chest and thigh. The scars - the children of Poseidon are not as pampered as the children in the city, nor are they pure and innocent - the adults here rarely confuse the children, perhaps because they never think that what they are doing is a crime It is a sinister, shameful and dirty act. Whether it is smuggling, drugs, gambling, or even arms sales, it is only work for people in Masoye, but some allow, some do not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in Poseidon Island, it has never been taken seriously. They are even worse than the Madonna of the local residents in the alcove. At least once and sincere prayer, in the face of officials, every resident of Masoye will close his mouth, just like a cast iron shell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boy with the name of the Big Devil swims near the pier. He pats the water in a place very close to Sasha. "Hey," he warmly invited: " Come, swear to the Virgin, it is absolutely energetic." He smiled at Sasha, this smile is as bright and warm as today's sunshine, without any cover, although it also has sunspots - born later than Sasha However, in the half year, Besib was in the process of changing teeth. He lost a front tooth on a piece of cold and hardened pie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he cried and went out, Sasha thought he would be angry for a while, if he angered in Sasha - anyway, one Because of his tragic, apparently under the average level of recognition, the boy mistaken another boy for a girl and asked him to marry him. This terrible accident happened to be adult and enough to be embarrassing and embarrassing— - This possibility is quite big, especially in the past two years, Sasha has already fully dealt with hundreds of peers (the process is not without interest, but Sasha has to euphemistically say, If he can, he is not prepared for the second time. The children in the 19th district have not been able to give Sasha a good or deep impression. In Sasha, it can be said that it has transcended the thinking of a small number of adults. They are like a group. Small animals that are carefully maintained by humans are as boring as they are. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the evening, Besib came to knock on the door of Hopkins’ father and son. He apologized to Sasha and invited Little Hopkins to participate. Evening activities, oh, don't get me wrong, it's the children's game. They wait for the turtles to come ashore to lay eggs. After the hard "mother" leaves, they dig up the nest buried in the sand to take the eggs. There are about a dozen eggs in a nest. The children are allowed to take one each. The next day, they will be handed over to their mother or sister. They will cook them according to the tradition of Poseidon Island. It is said to be on the child's body. All are good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha must admit that at the very beginning he couldn't help but be a gentleman's belly - he promised the invitation, but he was always prepared - who knows if this will be a trap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turns out that Besib is a good boy, and Sasha’s worries have not happened. As an inviter, Besib not only guarantees Sasha Hope. Kings’s harvest, safety and punctual return also subtly dragged him into the children’s social circle; Sasha is certainly not a fool, since Besib has shown his goodwill and open-mindedness, he also Will not continue to squat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His father taught him language and behavior long before, keeping distance, not just means "far." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as necessary, Sasha Hopkins can easily win the trust and love of others like his father, this time is no exception, the sea god island The children soon discovered that this “city” child was not as delicate, stupid, and inaccessible as it seemed. On the contrary, he was smart, courageous, powerful, and understanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a minute," Sasha said. "I can't wear such clothes to get into the water."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;He took off the hollow sandals of the lambskin with ease, and the bare/naked feet stepped on the wooden boards of the dock. The planks were soaked by the sun, soft, without a burr on the surface, only some sparse sand. Sasha quickly took the shirt off his head and took it off, untied the belt, and let the loose cotton trousers fall down lightly. Now, he has only one corner, exactly the same as the children of Poseidon Island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Virgin Mary, he is even whiter than my sister." A child sincerely praised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Like cream."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Meat like oysters."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha did not hear anything as he did. He did a few minutes of warm-up activities, then took a deep breath, and his toes clung to the edge of the pier planks and struggled forward. A jump, rushed into the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a large splash of water, the body that has been huddled into a group of sands slowly sinks down, the surface of the sea is hot, the middle layer Warm, it’s a bit colder, but it’s only here. Below is the sea sand. Sasha opens the body under the water. His feet touch the sea sand. The white sand is like a cloud in the sea. In the pervasive view, Sasha stretched out with the slight force of this cockroach. He waved his arm and floated up, and suddenly jumped out of the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The glaring light forced him to close his eyes slightly. He stepped on the water so that he could continue to float on the water, while jetting outwards, salty sea water spewed out of his nose, and then took his ears in order to expel other excesses. The water, he can feel the children of Poseidon Island around, one of them came over: "You swim better than we think." Besib seriously judged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha smiled lazily. He used to swim more in fresh water, accompanied by cannibals, crocodiles and otters; the sea is not bad. The buoyancy of the sea is relatively large, especially for children, who can swim to their destinations in groups like dolphins on the sea without much effort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The environment near Poseidon Island is well protected - the residents of Poseidon Island do not live by the fishery now, and of course do not develop tourism because of the island There are always smuggling boats with miniature submachine guns and short-handed shotguns coming and going. The neighboring fishermen are not willing to come here to fish. Over time, the surrounding waters are seaweed, coral, fish and children. Garden of Eden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where are we going today?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These days, Sasha has gone with them. There are quite a few places, including several secret caves. The caves are immersed in the sea and connected to the interior of the island. The passages are wide and there are iron fences at both ends. The black ladder extends into the dark river formed by the sea. The small vessels can be on the dark river. Drive and carry the items carried on the big ship here to remove them - the children don't have the keys to the iron fence, they can only hold the fence to see the deep darkness inside, but Sasha can imagine that smuggling How quickly and quietly put the goods on a narrow ladder, which may be the cellar that any of the people of Poseidon Island will have. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, Besib took Sasha to visit a squatting community. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shell that can hold a baby in the bath is quite a surprise for a child. The peacock blue, pink, emerald, brown-red fat coat and the dense cloth The markings are indeed pleasing to the eye, but it is another thing that attracts Sasha's attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not good looking, and it doesn’t make sense. It’s just a metal stick, it’s straight on a cement pile, and it’s sanded. It was found to have a crossbar at the top, which was firmly welded to the longitudinal one, slightly out of the water – a simple but strong cross. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
