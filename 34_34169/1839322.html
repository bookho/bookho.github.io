			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a minute."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the soldiers is preparing to launch Boa Douglas At the time, Charlie said: "We have a person here who is sick, let the sick person go back to the barn, she has no strength, can't push what is heavy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Boa. Douglas looked at Charlie, and the hatred in his eyes was as substantial. The leader believed that if it was possible, he would dig the boy's skull by himself and put a red iron sauce inside - but he was indeed a smart boy. He knew that it was useless to make a big noise with Charlie. There is only one person who can be the master here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Please, dear sir," he said softly. "You won't change your mind, right."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader looked at him interestingly, walked onto the pedestal of the baptismal pool, and carefully looked at Lila: "You are sick." He said: "Girl, do you want to go back?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lila gasped, she felt the breath through her lungs, the trachea and the mouth, almost burned the fragile mucous membranes: "I don't want to Go back," she said hoarsely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Clear choice." The leader admired, he jumped directly off the pedestal: "Otherwise, I have to let my soldiers bring two more people - I I will kill you and kill your little boyfriend. Well, now everything is fine, let the boy go back to the barn, we are all, clockwise seven times," he said: "counterclockwise seven laps, right? , Dean."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," said the dean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So what are you waiting for," said the leader, "push it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baoer. Douglas cast a gloating eye on Charlie. He didn't want to look at Besib and Sasha again, and the squatting woman Lila, but the soldier responsible for escorting him was already pushing him forward, at this key. At the moment, he does not want to anger the above-mentioned moody bastard leader because of some unnecessary small moves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They may return to the barn safely, but what about it, they can't do anything because he is Douglas. Boa. Douglas walked briskly in the footsteps. In the dimly lit ramp, this ramp didn't even have any window, so hot and greasy, which made him involuntarily think of the monster's esophagus. He is escaping from the bloody mouth, and the people he hates are left in the stomach pocket of the monster. This is a very happy thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a wheezing voice behind him. They were pushing the baptistery decorated with seven little demons. Boa went faster, ominous, and every place revealed ominous signs. He had to be faster. escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One cubic marble is about three tons in weight, and the marble baptismal pool in front of them is a standard size, about four feet deep. The width and length are about nine feet. If there are no organs below, even if they have ten times the number of people, they can't push it. Even so, it is still very difficult to get it started in the first minute. It is. The baptismal pool was not moving, and the leader stood on one side and stroked his pistol. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The soldiers I sent to the barn will come back within twenty minutes," said the leader. "I will let him bring two more people. He only needs one." When I stepped in, I immediately killed one and changed another. How? Can this make you work harder?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As long as... The dean said intermittently: "Move... just a moment... OK."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They took another thirty seconds. I heard the baptism of the baptismal pool, the beautiful sound, everyone’s hands were suddenly light, they finally moved, clockwise, the baptismal pool is like a large grinding disc, screaming and slowly rotating . One lap, two laps, three laps... The position of Besib is just behind the head, the thigh that is pierced is bleeding, the first aid bandage is useless, the dark red blood flows to the marble floor, he step on Your own blood. Sliding awkwardly, his chin was licking over the double horns of the drip nozzle and was torn out of a blood mouth that was no less inferior to other wounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are fifteen minutes." The leader said indifferently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie looked back and saw that he wanted to raise his father and was pushed back by the head of the team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishb left his position and reached out to the head of the head, and immediately picked him up and carefully avoided his wounds. Put him back in his position and let his chest close to the neck of the dripper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the group vaguely said thank you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this gap, Sasha touched Lila, who was standing between him and Besib, the girl’s stunned eyes closed, hands Holding the drip nozzle tightly, it was hot, and if it was an ordinary person, she had already completely fainted. But when Lila felt that Sasha was touching her, she could open her eyes and smile at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The baptismal pool began to turn again, this time no one fell, seven rounds clockwise, seven times counterclockwise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about the entrance?" The leader asked, all things are still the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Listen," the dean said hard before the leader was impatient: "Have you heard that voice? Just like giving a clockwork toy... The sound of the clockwork."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They heard, Gregorygrad, in the silent baptistery, as if from a far away place . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A soldier suddenly shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader looked at the place where he was in sight. It was the only passage connecting the outside world, the narrow ramp, it was shaking, shaking, Countless gravel fell from the top, and a soldier ran to the ramp. The next moment he gave a desperate scream, the ground collapsed, his feet trapped in the deep black hole, he fell to the ground. The stone shot, but only two shots, he was completely buried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crashing and spreading inward, the baptismal hall shivering slightly, the lamp on the top, the tall hanging, the whole picture that you want to see must be The bronze chandelier that lifted the head to the limit swayed lightly from the decoration on the little girl's schoolbag. Hey, sly, the stucco block depicting the fine murals peeled away and fell to the ground, filling the ground of the entire baptismal hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader jumped onto the pedestal and lifted the dean from the ground. The dean looked at him with a smile and a smile on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good job." The leader said that his glock17 withstood the forehead of the dean and fired a close shot. The entire head of the dean was Broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;吱嘎,吱嘎...The chandelier that has been working for this baptismal hall for hundreds of years is swaying, and cracks appear around the stone with the bronze chain fixed. More and more dense, more and more wide, the age is ten times the human mud in the air burst into a group of gray-black fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader put the pistol back in place, "kill them." He ordered, and then, with two soldiers, the famas f1's muzzle was aligned at the same time. The people at the baptismal pool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
