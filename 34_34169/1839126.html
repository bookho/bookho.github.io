He sighed with his colleagues, and returned Sasha Streif, holding the memo under his arm and staggering back to the private office at the end of the corridor—the privilege of the head of the St. Thomas Church Primary School. one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This office is small, with only a table, a few chairs, surrounded by a lockable metal filing cabinet, Mr. Humbert from In the memo, I took out today's record. There are only a few words on the record paper, but he still signed his name, stuffed it into a light yellow paper folder, and then put the folder in the tin cabinet. Let it squash with hundreds of similar people. After doing all this, Mr. Humbert did not lock the file cabinet. He bent down and reached into the bottom drawer of the metal cabinet to find it. Finally, he groaned. A stainless steel bottle with a capacity of about 5 ounces was produced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the St. Thomas Church Primary School rushed a cup of instant coffee, poured about two ounces of Irish whiskey inside, thought about it, and poured a little, then I’m so eager to drink a big sip – once in the cold winter, the transatlantic plane was close to the Irish airport, making the specials warming up the countless passengers on the last Friday of May, the warm and humid New York City. The district also played its part. Mr. Humbert felt that the ice cubes in the blood vessels were disappearing rapidly, and a poor little heart was not always swaying as it was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A weird child!" he whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has dealt with his father, the mother who died or left the mother more than once, just mentioning the mother and father they have lost, let them think If you don’t do it well enough, you will be abandoned. This is the truth. You see, other children are good, good, everything, because God is watching, they are good children, and some No - those little scorpions are not wow, crying is hysteria, even if hysterical will finally cry like it will die at any time, usually he will give some comfort, pat the head or give a hug, oh, It’s not that the little hybrids that are not ungrateful are screaming at him or want to take a bite, but then he has reason to teach them well, although New York City does not allow short wood pulp to beat the children’s ass. But he can drive them out - it will make their parents furious and then plead, if they don't want their children to be mixed with the nig or mixed-race children in the slums. Since then at least thirteen years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;St. Thomas Church Elementary School is a good old school and disciplined school. The glory of God has been shrouded here since 120 years ago. The teacher has been carefully screened - Mr. Humbert's hand shook a little, the coffee spilled on his shirt, he didn't notice this at all, he regretted it, he shouldn't submit the report so quickly, especially that It’s a report that is good for Streif. He should delay for a while and be an observing diary... What a terrible child he has. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked Sasha Streif to recall the scene of his mother’s death, just to pave the way for the later words...maybe this will make this beautiful child sad Extremely, but everything will be fine after that. Yes, yes, Mr. Humbert feels that he has done it right again. The doctor also said that it is good for physical and mental health to dig deep into the deep scars and crying. Although not public, he I think parents will recognize this approach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is that today's things are out of the ordinary track, or that they are out of his expectations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The abnormal child described the moment when his mother died - from the face of the wax figure of the wax museum to the cold The wrist (which is inversely proportional to the warm hands of the nurse holding his shoulders); from the difficult breathing from the respirator until the doctor says "Yes, take the child away."; Hard and smooth floor from the ward To the warm and soft carpet in the lounge... the words are accurate, the tone is dull, and it can be accurate to the second. The children’s memories are unfolded in front of the Humbert, highlighted, and then deeply imprinted into his mind. Humbert felt like he was standing there together, watching the woman die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are certainly not enough to make an adult, a calm, healthy adult feel terrified, so that Mr. Hunter’s deep discomfort is that he and The position of Sasha Streif seems to be reversed - the child is observing him, admiring him, sipping him... the uneasiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Streif stepped into the classroom, he also thought of another thing that made him sweaty - if it was a normal child, he almost It is certain that it will not talk about anything, even if it is said, parents may not believe, but Sasha Streif is not the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His father not only loves him, but also believes in him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Hembert regretted his own shackle for the first time, and he probably shouldn’t let Sasha Streif be here at the beginning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Streif" father and son returned to "because they were peeled The classrooms supervised by the saints of the saints who became the protectors of the tanning, let Sasha’s little surprise, in addition to the empty classrooms, Zhang is quite familiar and proud. Face - Dolores Kent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I thought you had gone back." Sasha saw Dolores and Annie on the school bus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The school bus drove out for a minute, I vomited on the school bus." Dolores holds a cup of thick chocolate like solid chocolate, excited The tone makes Sasha almost think that she is not spit out undigested food and stomach juice but roses and perfume. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha unconsciously retreated and let Dolores anger: "What is your expression! I have made it very clean!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hop Hopkins looked at the two children, he smiled, walked over and put his hand on the shoulder of Sasha: "Yes, Sasha, I promise She has made it very clean, I personally helped her. In addition, you may want to thank her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha cast a questioning look And then, without fear, I saw Dolores's blushing up - Dolores' skin because she likes to run around under the sun like a boy, tanned like a mulatto, in tan It's a great thing to see the bleeding color on the skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She came to tell me that you were left to talk to Mr. Humbert, Mr. Humbert is a strict person, she is worried about you." Hopkins The doctor said straightforwardly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha opened his mouth slightly, and Dolores raised the cup, his eyes turned around on the chocolate: "He is too fierce "The little girl said: "And you are too small."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My work is over." Dr. Hopkins said: "After a while, I called your mother, Miss Dolores Kent, I will send you back."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Great." The little girl deliberately didn't go to see Sasha. "If you let my mom pick her up, I have to lick my dog's blood."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s just a thank you," Mr. Hopkins paused for a long time: "I think your vomiting is for a reason?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now even Sasha can feel the heat from the little girl's face: "...this is nothing," she screamed: "I hate Humbert."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since then she has been buried in the chocolate, Sasha frowned, he felt that he might have made a mistake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he introduced his mother, he first thought of a female paranoia whose name begins with "c" (although there is a stage he enjoys this Partial paranoia) and the huge and powerful "institution" behind her, he thought that Mr. Humbert was related to these people, or the police. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Children are not allowed to sit in the passenger seat, and Sasha and Dolores sit side by side in the back seat, and the seat belts hold them tightly in their seats. They depend very close, and Sasha only needs to turn his head to see the ears of Dolores, who are only a few inches away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Humbert said to you...do that?" He thought he needed to confirm: "Some words."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...He said that it was because I was not so good enough that my father returned to work in the Hussein area. For this reason, my mother would not care too much for this reason. Dolores was silent for a few seconds before he replied with a very light voice (not much louder than the air conditioning in the car): "He also said that Anne Kent is more like the daughter of the Kent family than I am... Not me, the Kent couple likes Anne, if possible, they will send me to the orphanage and leave Anne at home."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Obviously, he I like the letter of the mouth and the yellow is better than everything." Sasha made a cold assessment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a moment, Dolores turned his head, and her plucked hair swept over the tip of Sasha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... um," the little girl embarrassedly grabbed her head. "I know you are comforting me," she asked. "But the letter... What does female...yellow mean?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......Sasha licked his lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A simple pedophile."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A simple pedophile." Dr. Hopkins agreed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha is a bit frustrated, he thinks too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter, dear, cautious is a virtue." Dr. Hopkins in a white misty freezer: "Chicken or duck?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Duck." Sashaman doubted Sin: "Why do I think you are very happy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Any father has the right to be happy at this time.” Dr. Hopkins put the duck in the cold water pool and pulled out a note pad with a pen while waiting for the thaw. The meat in the house needs to be supplemented: “When he When the child is very popular," he said seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
