			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grande’s football team coach walked into the school’s underground garage, and under the gloomy white lights, he saw some good cars – black Maybach, dark brown Porsche, brown Bentley, mica-colored Maserati, red Audi, gem-blue Jaguar... they belong to the principal and teachers who can have a place in the school board, and a silver Messer Dess, the new school doctor, is said to be a nobleman. Before becoming a school doctor at Grande, he was a well-known and talented psychologist. One of the most profitable businesses in the West, he was willing Quoted in this low position, because of his beloved son, Sasha Hopkins is studying in Grande. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coach stood in front of Mercedes, and the silver-white front cover illuminated his irritated and melancholy face. Today he euphemistically raised the wish to the school. He did not get a clear response to the renewal of the next contract. He knew that the members of the school committee wanted to see how the football team performed in this year's inter-school league. The division champion was very good... ... If you can get the top ten in the National League competition, they will be prepared for a contract that will be satisfying, whether it is treatment or salary... A group of smashing balls! The coach cursed silently, they seem to have forgotten that Grande’s football team won only 30 points in the divisional league before he coached – and the Grands football team There are only forty teams in the division. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but what can he say? Laugh at the idiots who are whimsical? They can hold your life and kill power in their hands! He can't even refuse... He can't reach their wish - in Grandry, his salary can only be said to be average, but outside of Grande, people who do the same work with him simply can't get it. More money - if you were not fortunate enough to get the job, he would probably have gone bankrupt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weak wife has no way to leave home to go out to work, their relatives are all destitute, self-satisfied guys, connecting two wrong investments to force him to empty The bank’s deposits sold the house. They are now living in a dirty and chaotic apartment. The neighbors are all pimps and du goods dealers (he didn't dare to modify the staff contact list). He didn't dare to let her daughter go home. She shared a room with her friends. The suites near the school spend her spring break and summer vacation. Pay 500 yuan a month. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those people, it’s just the price of two shirts, but he can’t breathe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His daughter is also a good boy. She didn't have a good old-fashioned origin, but she was very smart. She entered Visido by her achievements. Weissdorf gave her a quarter of the tuition fee. There are scholarships, but these can only be said to be a drop in the bucket for the cost of a private aristocratic school girl – they need to play the piano. Playing the cello, you need to go horse riding, you need to learn ballet and classical dance, you need to play cricket and squash, you need to play a role in the stage on the stage - the school also often holds various fundraising and charity activities. (Although I personally need to be charitable), the coach does not think ironically, but just think about it, 1,000 yuan to 2,000 yuan a year, this is a necessary expenditure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After knowing that they sold the original house, the daughter had proposed to drop out of school and then transferred to a cheap public school. He was severely rejected. "I will be able to sign a new and rewarding new contract next year," he said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his predictions, he can get a team of 10 or 5, and he will get a A new contract that can get more money. But it is clear that the people of the school board don't think so - the coach thinks that it is Bishb. Bissand gives them this unrealistic idea, but football is not a chess game where everyone can determine everything. Or a tennis match. There are fifteen players in each game. Everyone can be loyal to their position in their own position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a whimsy that he feels a little stupid - that is to let Besib. Bissau be a backup for the quarterback in the league. Played on. But then he lacked a forward who could run and collide, so this thought was quickly thrown behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coach’s car is in the depths of the garage, in a corner, the crimson Ford Mustang is a used car, but its owner takes care of it. Not bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tall, burly black shadow stands on the left side of the Ford, close to the door, the coach was shocked, but then calmed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to go back to the team." The shadow said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coach sighed heartily, and some of the children in the team used medication occasionally. He knew this, but he didn’t mean that he would be strong if he took the medicine. - Avery Famo is a lucky little guy, the drug plays a significant role in him, but he is also a bad lucky guy, he was found to have illegal drugs, but also suspected of buying and selling, although the latter is not It was finalized, but the school board had lost patience with the name of Famo. "I can't," the coach said. "You know what it is because it's not just those medicines." He hinted that he couldn't say anything. Too clear, in case Avery Famo is carrying a voice recorder, he is eager for the next contract, and does not want to provoke the members of the school committee to be unhappy, as he just said, he can also explain that he is Free is not satisfied with the performance in the team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
