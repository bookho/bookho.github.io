			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people living in the East China or elsewhere will mistakenly think that the so-called red hair is like the red of the flame, or the cinnabar-like Red, the orange skin is golden red, and the real red hair is bright brown. It is like a polished, shiny copper wire. This color is very beautiful, but some people People who don't like red hair, such as Besib, because according to the priest of Poseidon, Judas is red-haired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Red Hair Judah" certainly won't really be called Judas. In Las Vegas, most people who manage casinos have a close and humorous, easy The nickname of memory, Shane Battier’s surname was originally a nickname, meaning “bat”, because when he was a child, he often squatted in any darkness and did not attract people. The place of attention, the action is quieter, like a little mouse that has come out to hunt at dusk; and in the proverb, Battier still has "neural disorder; crazy, mad, crazy" The meaning of "stupid" - Shaun Battier's actions at the time made it difficult for many people to understand, especially their peers. Battier was regarded as "self-satisfaction" and "fool" for a period of time. "There is only a few people who can see a trace of clues from his anomalous behaviors. Even so, no one can expect that the temperament is lonely, the silent and capable children will become a big casino." the host. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shawn did not know who his father was, and the mother who died of alcoholism when he was four years old did not leave in the heart of the child. After a deep impression, after becoming a casino deputy, he asked his friend, Dr. Hopkins, to give himself a good name, and then used the nickname as the surname - red hair Judah, a sudden appearance in Las Vegas The young man of Sis is very similar to him at this point - no one knows which corner of the horn he was found by Shane Battier, he has no name. I didn’t have the power. I didn’t show any admirable ability or eloquence during the initial period. The reaction was not quick enough. The appearance can only be said to be correct. Everyone is guessing that he and Battier are It’s not a matter of blood, it’s the position of the deputy at once – simply, he’s not the illegitimate son of Shane Battier – they first called him Tom in accordance with Battier’s introduction. But after a year or two, he has the nickname of identity and personality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, people call him Judas. Not just because of the fluffy red hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I saw it," said Red Hair, a big pun. "You have two small guests."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Shane Battier let me Take them around in the casino," responded with vigilance: "They have not yet reached the age of gambling. But it is not illegal to look around."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" People who work with green eyes, it’s not a big deal to find a place to gamble on a few.” Judah said, where is he standing, like the ice cream tower used as a decoration on the buffet ban, except for the head Bright red hair. Eyebrows, eyelashes, brown eyes, a brown-colored wound next to the eyes and the squid-colored lips, the whole body is white, white three-piece dress. White bow tie, white pants and leather shoes, he also carries a pair of white gloves. Silk, the metallic luster shines under the light: "Here is the Palace of Heaven, gentlemen, everyone knows, green eyes are its darling."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Shane Battier will not be happy that someone has violated his rules and the laws of Las Vegas." Calmly said: "Nobody can, you can't. I can't, we have to be cautious, Judas, Pakistan. Mr. Tyre will not be happy to hear who is gambling in his casino. You know more about me than Mr. Shane Battier, even if it is the only apple on the branch, if it doesn’t fit his heart. He will also smash it down and smash it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red-haired casino deputy grinned and he had two white and sharp canines. It looked like a vampire. He didn't talk. He just took two steps to the Apple machine that pulled out two Jack treasures. He stood in the red hat and put it in front of the old man in his hand. He looked at the machine in silence: "I pulled two Jack treasures at once," he It’s ridiculously commented: “It’s almost as good as the lucky one who killed seven at a time (see Grimm’s fairy tale, the protagonist is a big but lucky enough tailor),” the old gentleman looked at uneasily. Bu and Sasha, the two children looked at him as usual, and Besib made a universal lucky gesture. He fixed his mind, turned his head and smiled at the red hair, and did not speak. He did not take the initiative to admit that he was the master of the two Jack Treasures, but he did not guilty of throwing thousands of black chips and left unrelatedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well," Judas’s smile was a little bigger: "You are a good luck man, sir," he walked to the machine, from the outlet. A large black chip was caught in the coin cup and stuffed into the old gentleman's hat: "These are all yours. Jack," he said to a casino guard who always followed him. "Call. Two people come, register their names for our guests, then pack them up, and let Marie open a bottle of spades a champagne to congratulate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In fact, two waiters waited aside, but when the green eyes and red hair were on the opposite side, their two little characters were not eligible to be inserted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you can," Mr. Lao patted the black chips in his pocket, his two large pockets were tamed: "Direct Give me the bottle of wine, I can take it on the plane."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The plane will not take off so fast," Judah said: "Your luck." It is the best one of the people I have ever met. Please give us some time. We have to register you, and... let me see your loyalty card... Oh, it’s a pity, it’s just Ordinary guest loyalty card, but I may be able to make a special VIP card for you, so that you can get free drinks and free upgrades when you come next time, you can also get a prize before leaving. - You can draw up to 5,000 yuan. During this time, you can sip champagne in the VIP lounge and be quiet and comfortable, not waiting for a long time, I promise." He lifted his chin and turned to The old gentleman is indicating that the young girl who is approaching from the side corridor, she is young, beautiful, wears Exposure, had two perfect ** and buttocks. She is not going very fast, one is to show off the wind, the second is also for the bottle of gold-colored champagne - the price of this champagne is up to 400 yuan per bottle, in case of breaking, she can I have been working in the house for several nights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man stared at the lovely little rabbits - for a few minutes, when the Marianne walked in front of him, he showed a heart A real smile: "No," he took the wooden box with the wine: "I still prefer to bring this little baby back to my room, no, no, you don't need your company, miss, I have been excited once. I don't want to come back for the second time, please register me, I don't think it will take too long." He shrugged his shoulders with champagne: "You are a generous person, red-haired gentleman, the problem is, I am lazy. People," his smile became awkward: "I don't think I will come again, especially the VIP card... It's a good thing, but it's not very useful for me - but I still have to thank you for your champagne. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A savvy old guy." Green eyes are taking After the two children walked away, they said: "Although the conclusion is difficult to finalize before he gets on the plane, I think... he It’s the kind of person who has some self-control.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His footsteps are very brisk, the voice also has a little jump and rise, red hair is still big and green The eyes are the opposite of the natural family. They are always in the same position for the favor and attention of Shane Battier. They have their own strengths. With the identity of the city councilor, they can always receive a certain body. And the big customers of the forces, and Judah wins in the utmost - he is very good at using men and women to confuse the characters he wants to deal with or the big customers worth fighting for. Sometimes he doesn't even mind being on the court. He is "out of talent". , recruiting and retaining a lot of wealthy female guests, but once they can no longer squeeze out the oil, Judas will drive them away or "introduction work", which implies that they go to **. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
