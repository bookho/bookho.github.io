			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't understand, God, the father of man, how can you abuse his children and grandchildren, and listen to their call sign and remain indifferent." - Hugo<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Boa took a slap in the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His tympanic membrane is so squeaky that it seems that someone has stuffed a bee into his ear canal, and warm liquid flows out of his nose. He stood unsteadily and fell sideways on the hard floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foguez Douglas is a man of six feet, one inch tall and weighs two hundred pounds. His shoulders are wide and his limbs are strong. Standing there is enough to block. All the light that most people can perceive; he has a rough and violent face, his eyebrows are thick, and he is cluttered, pressing a pair of light blue eyes - it is particularly cold when it freezes. Ruthless - Unlike most modern men, Foggs has a beard, black hair extending from two to the top of the lips, forming two rounded depressions under the cheeks, curled like hair, thick and unusual, It is difficult for people to see his face and peep into his expression, which makes him look like a fierce and wicked person who was exiled to the New World in the 18th and 19th centuries, rather than a "trendant of a fashionable society." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the same is true. As a patriarch of the Douglas family, he is qualified to be a member of a "small circle", but he The luck was so bad that the Douglas family’s power was the biggest defeat in his childhood and childhood, and his father couldn’t even send him and his brother Ossien to Grande (their ancestors For a lifetime, they had to cross three districts and go to another boarding school with a good reputation. Osien was smarter than him. He successfully applied to Baylor College of Medicine, which ranked fourth in the entire Western Confederation. Fifteen, it is already very good for ordinary people. But for them, especially Douglas, it can only be regarded as second-rate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but that is at least better than Foggs. There are only a few universities that Ferguson can apply for, not a poor location (filled with it) The poor and the black!), that is, the teaching level can only be said to be unsatisfactory (original professors and boring courses), or the financial situation can be described as stretched (immediately needed large donations!), or prospects (alumni) Recorded pale and bleak) - Fergus's parents spent a lot of effort to stuff their eldest son into the 17th-ranked University of Notre Dame, where he spent eight years of pain and hardship. (usually only four to five years), and finally got enough credits for the diploma - but these eight years can not be said to be wasted. He met a group of friends, some of whom could not say that they were first-rate figures in politics and finance, but they could also speak a little. And they are also willing to help Foggs Douglas (of course, they are equally eagerly looking forward to return), Douglas grabbed their hands and climbed from the mud of failure, and escaped the tragic ending of bankruptcy, old Douglas cleverly The land grabbed an unexpected windfall from the financial turmoil that swept the entire continent. Then a compensation for the factory that was on the verge of bankruptcy but was destroyed by the workers once again nourished the poor and poor little children of Douglas... Ferguson Douglas was able to loosen the door when he took over the family business. In one breath, in addition, although he has no feelings about physics, astronomy and sonnets, he is very successful in doing business, and it is time for Boa. Noel Douglas to enter school. The Douglas family has successfully reclaimed the original site and is ready to further expand its territory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The anger of Fergus Douglas can be imagined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ossien is named Douglas, and Boa is also named Douglas. One of them is his younger brother and the other is his son. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foggs' wife, Boa’s biological mother stood up from the sofa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't worry," Foggs snorted and said, "I have to pay attention to his measurements, and his teeth and nose won't have any problems."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The best is this." His wife said in a warning: "You have never taken him to the dentist, not once. You never look at it." He brushed his teeth. Do you know how much it took me to get a good white and healthy tooth? - This is not what you can do with a babysitter.".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;;; Foggs smashed Boa, violently squeezed his mouth, as carefully examined as the animal: "Nothing, every one is, good."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said earlier," Boa’s mother sat down again and began to read a pocketbook of poetry in her hand: "You can beat him with thin bamboo strips." The sole of the foot, which can make him long-term and not leave any ugly scars or sequelae of bad treatment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb Sp; "I am mad," Foggs threw Boa back to the ground: "Just for an ass!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems like you are not So what did you do," his wife carefully healed a corner of the poem: "Boa, you should learn more from your father. He used to play around with countless ass, experienced, and tactics. The old road, although it has failed many times, but at least not like you... um..." She squinted at Boa: "Wolf."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Forgus drums his lips, as if he wants to swear, but he still resists. "A butt is not worthy of my anger," he looked at his son. "I am not happy because you lost a mess. My son," he said, "I am still tired of me, and the entire Douglas family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I won." Boa retorted: " I punish the traitor, Marcia, and Ossien."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God, you are an idiot," Fergus said impatiently. "Dear," he said to his wife. "There is no thin bamboo here. I think I have to use a belt."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His wife did not lift his head, just made a "you are free" gesture, the action is quite elegant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baoer obviously cringed a little, "No, you can't!" The boy screamed, he climbed back and forth with his hands and feet, and the vines fell from the floor. In the first place, he entangled the man's legs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man’s face suddenly became weird. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah," he said, "Is this your cuddling?" He moved, and the vine's bondage tightened immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can let it kill." Boa said, the voice is still a little trembling: "Ossien is better than me - he can't fight me." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fogues's wife looked up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fogues picked up his robes, his thick palms were hidden in his lower back, and when it reappeared, he had already held a large stainless steel gun body. Caliber pistol, he opened the insurance, shot at the floor, the gunshots were deafening, the broken floor pieces flew around, scratching Boa's face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At first I thought I just needed to change a school," Foggs said. "I didn't expect that I should be a son. Your stupid order. I can't wait to emulate Cronus to swallow you in the stomach, Boa," he said. "What do you think this little trick can count? If you want to kill, you can use a gun, the minimum is only one hundred yuan, you You can also use a knife, just ten yuan - instead of amused by the rotten tea dregs that Ossien chews and chews - is amused," he grinds a dark green leaf with a muddy smell: " Perform once, reward one thousand to two thousand, can spit fire, can dive, can blow bubbles, can kiss crocodiles, can pass through the wall ... more, everything is not unusual - - Do you want to work with them? Oh, my son, you are developed, this is a very profitable craft." He maliciously took out a few notes from the inside of the jacket: "Come, dear, maybe you Willing to come again? I will applaud, and your mother, right?" He is his wife.  Say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes," his wife said. ‘<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can really kill!" Boa shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about that?" Foggs's wife was a pale and slender woman. Boa inherited her father's eyes and hair, but inherited her figure. And facial contours: "Whoever can kill, the old guy who is in the hospital bed of the public hospital can kill, curled up in the box, the tramp of the fleas can kill, as long as thirty dollars make you happy one night's night ( The son can kill, the whole day is noisy, the little niggers who come and go in the alleys can kill people - do you think that you will become special because of killing? It’s ridiculous. My son. That will only let You become a sinister, unspeakable criminal, you will be arrested, tried, detained or sentenced to death, what is the execution of my state's death penalty (she looks at her husband), right, it is injection of cyanide Potassium, as long as three minutes, you will die completely. This has nothing to do with the weapons you use, or that the gadgets that should only appear in the third-rate horror film will make your situation more disadvantageous. Humans have always hated it differently Things, think about the witches of the fifteenth century? If possible, they will burn you alive.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be a message in the newspaper that others will drink at breakfast Read it when coffee, what do they say? Son.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, just for an ass.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;not even for an a."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She put down the riddled little poem (just now she used it as a shield): "Boa You have to forgive your father - you have to understand him, your nephew, so that you can remember your mistakes." Boa's mother shook her head gracefully: "Let me come and explain to you." - Boa, you shouldn't be on Osien's first." She smiled. "He never saw you as a nephew. You should be alert to him. Second," she Stretch out two fingers: "You can retaliate against Ossian, um, who else?... Rossia? But you should tell your father about this, he will have a way to collect it. Theirs, your way of dealing with the whole thing is very bad, Ossien is still surnamed Douglas after all, he let our previous efforts almost all wasted, your father managed to keep Douglas in the school board, but He couldn't stop the people of the Carson family from inserting a foot in it." She sighed: "You should know something, son."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Take off your shoes and socks." The mother said: "Face down and squat on the floor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
