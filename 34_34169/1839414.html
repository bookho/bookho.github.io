			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking is a very fast thing, faster than a train, faster than an airplane, depending on the situation and owner, perhaps faster than electricity and light. So the little activities of the father and son need not be too hasty, they still have time to discuss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the world of Besib?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Poseidon Island."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Celegal is the ocean," the doctor said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Celegal. Bisangdi allows you to enter his mind?" Sasha does not think that Besib’s father will trust him like Besib trusts himself. My own father. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Others have never allowed it." Hopkins, standing in the thoughts of Sasha, smiled. This is a kind of triumph but not People hate, or correctly say, full of beautiful smiles, revealing white and small teeth, and deep wrinkles gather around the corners of the eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--Many people think that remembering a palace is an extremely mysterious and rare thing. In fact, everyone (except for mentally handicapped) can make their memories just right. They are built, but they don’t have the same mentality as Holmes or Hopkins, so the things they build are generally simple, rough, and yes, not like a movie about subconsciousness. As described, it is as clear as another world, and it will not change countless guards with machine guns. Most people do not even have the concept of constructing a cube. Their subconscious mind is a litter of rubbish. If you need something, you will have to work hard and find it for a long time. Some of them will never be found, unless a hypnotist who is good at digging and guiding is willing to spend precious time and energy on him for some reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins had brought Sasha into the mind of a boy who had an IQ between 175 and 185, not a idiot in the usual sense. Pukins commented this way, but his world still seems to be cut. The film of moldy defects is full of ambiguity and violation of logic - the master of the world does not think. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because the owner can naturally fill the illogical," Hopkins said: "As long as they are willing to use their brains." I thought, adding: "It's not difficult at all, as long as it's not an idiot - everyone can do it. When you fall asleep, control your own 'dream', they can quietly close the road that splits a huge gap between thoughts. It can also turn the beasts chasing them into scorpions and scorpions, or grab the ropes hanging in the air when they fall, or change into a thick mattress - but the range is small and can be clearly presented. Things can only appear where they are focused, others are vague – they can't gather, understand, and plan so much at the same time. They can only give up most to ensure the most important Impact."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib has never measured IQ, but his world is more coherent and detailed than the boy, although the place that makes people feel real and sturdy is probably only a small piece than the Sangdi mansion, but the sea god island The entire contour and the surrounding sea water are still faintly visible. It was a bit abstraction. Hopkins took a leaf filled with dark green color in the childish strokes as he passed through the olive grove and tore it away. In the moonlight he waited for the leaves to heal automatically. No, it turned into an indescribable strange piece. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is controlling the world of Besib?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't know." Sha said that he left Besib in his own world, the cottage, both protection and imprisonment. "He found that the wind, water, and light are no longer flowing before they notice that something is wrong."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is like a fly that solidifies in the resin." Doctor A pun is saying: "I think I know who it is - need to be reminded?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Old Andreana." Sasha said: " There are not many people who can trust both Chegal, Bisand, and Besib and Bissance." This person not only controls Besib but also controls the sangdi - if Bessib’s thoughts are not I became stupid or crazy because I was attacked by my close relatives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Hopkins showed a smile, this smile belongs to the "Ghoul." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let me kiss when I leave," said the ghoul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha docilely leaned over. Anthony Hopkins bit his intimacy on his nose, even in a person's spiritual world, his lips are still sharp and burning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-It’s incredible to find someone who follows the traces left by another person’s mind, but it’s really Simple, Besib. Bissand believes that Sasha Hopkins, he gave his friends the greatest authority. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Hopkins is curious as to what this chocolate kid will choose as his character. As a result, he gave Sasha a sand bug: "Remember, my first gift. For me at that time, it was a very interesting thing." So when he saw the beautiful one at first sight . When a foreign child (who thought it was a girl), he gave the most generous gift he could make as a child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand worm squirmed slowly, Anthony Hopkins had left, and the next step was to find the old Andriana - the power of the old Andriana made the world of Besib a prisoner of his own The cage, starting from a certain area, everything in it gradually became dead and chaotic, and the turpent--Anthony Hopkins described it as wonderful, which is why Besib barely escaped here. The encirclement is from the outside to the inside, there is no shadow, no sound, no sound and a vicious smell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha wants to find the old Andriana and invade her spirit, she must go into the "rostor" and then trace the flow along the "rope" Find the past and find the source. Fortunately, Old Andriana didn't take too much effort - the spiritual world of Besib is a whole sea god island, and there is a sea circle around a few nautical miles, including the sky and the earth above, and the enveloping area of ​​"rostor" Only limited to the house of Sangdi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most heavy place of "rostor" is probably between the room and the first floor of the mulberry, and Sasha even found a place where Besib stood out and escaped. Not completely masked, just like the traces you made on the hot candle tears will not be annihilated very quickly, but he did not go in there, he does not need to alarm the old Andriana, he knows too little about her, But he knows how to invade and control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They may love, like, ignore, confuse, guard, dislike, hate Sasha Hopkins, but no one can reject his power - just Even Martin, who can't wait to make Hopkins chew, can't do what Sasha needs to do is to use it carefully and cautiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enemies of Poseidon Island are full of abilities, and their resistance to Sasha is not even one tenth of ordinary people, just like a hunger The most extreme person can't resist the temptation of food and water. This is instinctive rather than any rational behavior. In the past, Sasha only did it by extending his own tentacles, invading the minds of those people, and doing whatever he wants. Dig out what you want, he can find the best, and can find the worst, then what to do depends on the situation - psychological and neurological torture than * on the top of the torment The point is that as long as you can grasp the degree of living, then it can come again and again, like a Trojan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But today he can't be so rude, old Andriana's brain is connected with Besib, he doesn't want to end up in old Andrea After Na, it was discovered that Besib’s brain had turned into a beautiful big amber. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the old Andriana is surrounded happily and kindly, indicating that its owner is also in a very peaceful state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Keep this way," Sasha said in his heart: "Let me find you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Celegal. The world of Bissal is the ocean, the deep red ocean, the ocean of thick blood, solid horny and bone The texture creates a sturdy island and reef, white or transparent nerves, ligaments densely covered with goose-yellow ochre, thick muscles of fat and fat, sticking out in the "sea water", a huge pair The basking shark swims around Dr. Hopkins. Its head is two kidneys, and hundreds of eyes are staring at the ghouls. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; hordes of jellyfish in the ocean cruises from a variety of films composed of large and small, variety, Hopkins a finger I grabbed one, it was unexpectedly large, and almost made a coat for Mr. Ghoul. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; ". Let go of my peritoneum" Qiejia Le thundered that the sound is emitted from a deep place to come, is more intense than the sound vibrations The "biological" in "Ocean" escapes like a real fish in the sea, and the "seaweed" retracts the fat earlier than they do: "The uninvited old bastard." br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; ". outside has been a mess." Anthony Hopkins said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe," Chegal said: "But I can't do anything about it now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't you think that Old Andriana would do this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Celegal was silent for a while: "No," he denied. "I have Think - I think... I really want to keep going."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know that this is impossible, your body, it just wants Eat it only - a piece of blood connected to the blood is far from enough to satisfy it, it will eat more things, including itself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't believe you, Anthony Hopkins, of course, we are friends, but your son is the most important, you might make to your son would not get upset and helped my son against me.
