			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manchester Private University does not have a river, but it has a large private land with lakes, meadows and forests. Only those who study and work in Manchester and their relatives can Inside, the Manchesterns call it Rose, because on the map it looks like an open rose. After the opening ceremony, I sang hymns together, enjoyed orchestral music, received information and listened to the general introduction of life and learning by their respective deans. After enjoying the delicious champagne in the principal’s courtyard, the number was about one hundred and two hundred. Fifty or so, excited new students were sent to the huge lake - their predecessors, third graders and fourth graders were waiting for them in a good manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Dear Sirs, ladies, look at the front!" A fourth-grade student with a miniature microphone standing in a chair shouted, the following are The fresh people who were fainted by Champagne and Manchester were stupidly following his instructions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's in front of you? Like every park with lakes and rivers, emerald green lawns, sparkling lakes, dark brown hydrophilic platforms and sapphire lakes, three-story brick red jogging and cycling lanes, if you want to say If there is anything unusual, there is only that special road. It is much wider than the jogging lanes they see. It can accommodate almost two cars in parallel - the dedicated road in front of them is almost straight until one The grove had just turned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are going to be a small game," said the fourth grader. "You, from here, all the way to the woods, there are a total of 3,000 feet. You can Run for ten seconds first, then we will start chasing. If you can go to the grove first, even if you win, even if we catch it in the process, we will lose."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What will happen if you lose?" A girl asked, her cheeks red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The loser is subject to punishment." The fourth grader said that he showed a tolerant and insidious smile: "Don't ask what it is because you guys I will know soon." When he finished, he jumped off the chair that was temporarily used as a podium. He dropped the microphone and handed it back to the logistics staff. It was as easy to integrate into the group as the cream falling back into the soup pot. The seniors who are gearing up are gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two professors (one of whom has also won the Nobel Prize) are happy and the seniors are rushing together like a group of ducklings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's still a bit unfair." Chekal Bissang, who can see clearly without a telescope, said: "That special road is wider than its kind. But it still can't accommodate so many people at the same time. The people behind are very easy to get caught."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No one in the rules said that you must run on a dedicated road." Hopkins The doctor said: "People who can be admitted to Manchester will not be stupid enough to even think of this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just when the two parents spoke, the black pressure The new students ran up and the professor and their relatives clashed and cheered them up. As Big Hopkins said, some people are indeed crowded on the special road, but more people are scattered on the gentle slope of the slope, and ten girls who have not been stunned by champagne are flexible. I took my own shoes and flew around the skirt. After a while, the boys did the same. They not only took off the shoes that slipped easily on the grass, but also took off the cumbersome coat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten seconds have passed, it seems that the new students are just starting to run and climb. I have long been unable to hold back, and the eager senior students have chased them up. Their number is twice as many as that of the new students. They are loosely dressed and wear shoes suitable for running on their feet. The foremost freshman has not finished a third of the journey, and the unlucky freshman has been caught. The chaser has skillfully turned his prey to the ground, and then, with the temporary partner, one looks up and the other One person lifted his foot, shouted the horn, and threw him into the lake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s August. The problem is that the lake in Rose Park is in the dry season. When the water surface is below the groundwater level, its water is supplied by groundwater. The temperature of the groundwater is much lower than that of the water pipes and swimming pools. Therefore, although the freshmen who were thrown into the lake were quickly caught. It was frozen enough, especially when there was a strong wind blowing them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is the surprise you said?" asked Besib. "I thought it would be a dance party!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is much more honoured than the dance." Sasha, who is running beside him, said, "This custom is in It was there at the beginning of the school, when it was thrown into the fountain - it was only cancelled 30 years ago."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why cancel?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because since then, Manchester has begun to recruit female students and minorities. They can’t throw the freshman caught in the pool, if they treat a woman like this They will be charged, and treating a minority in this way will be accused of racial discrimination."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So," Besib ran a few steps faster. As a versatile, they always had to be careful not to overtake normal humans when they were exercising, but when more than a thousand people ran to a place at the same time, they I have to be careful not to be tired of being a pig teammate. He just saw a guy who was flexible and ran very fast because he was caught by another clumsy guy: "Why did they recover?" "" Still in their session! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because an old alumnus raised it," Sasha said: "They think that Manchester, which has removed too many customs, is no longer the Manchester they are familiar with. Given... um, I mean, last year’s alumni donations and other reasons, the principal and the school board decided to restore some customs with 'Manchester' characteristics, and the 'Enrollment Ceremony' is one of them.”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What percentage of donations accounted for? 90%?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know," Sasha Shrugging and said: "I only know that last year's alumni donations, especially for the 45th, their donation amount is 240 million yuan."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Wow," said Besib. "That is, they donated an average of two million."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"More than," Sasha said: "There were only about 600 people in the first forty-fifth session."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are the first two of the people who rushed into the grove Not both before and after, Besib noticed that there were a few people who knew that adult seniors were standing in the woods. They stood here to monitor whether there was an accident: for example A new student who was chaotic by alcohol or too excited was ran into the depths of the woods. They counted the number of winners, and then collaborated with the companions of the statistical losers to ensure that no such new students escaped the "second baptism" - although it is wearing clothes, this is really a bit regrettable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only one-third of the freshmen who escaped, and the majority of women--the high-ranking students who are the pursuers are men. Ok, I can get down to the little girl who is as delicate and full as a rose flower and throw it into the cool water of the lake. Obviously, it’s not a change. It’s a real flower buddy – even those Freshmen who are thrown into the lake will not raise it, or they are busy snoring, runny nose, and receive blankets and steaming ginger tea from teachers and seniors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As early as the opening ceremony, the students’ dormitory has been properly arranged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Manchester's traditions and requirements, all students are not professional before the second grade. They are studying at a college, Manchester College of Arts and Sciences, and the residence is also Manchester 10. The second of the dormitory colleges is the closest to the teaching area in the middle of the 18th century Georgian period. The upper end of the dark green ivy has become a wine-like mellow, covering the white wood arranged in a six-to-six manner. The panes and the gray-grey mottled stone exterior, the six-paneled brown oak door is decorated with black iron lead-striped scalloped windows. It was originally built for the principal and his family, so it has the same structure and layout as most of the contemporary buildings, four floors above ground and one basement. The basement is for servants, as well as the water room, kitchen and food storage room, with separate doors for access; the first floor is the dining room, the second floor is the two-part living room, the first half is used to entertain the outside, the second half For the owner and close friends and relatives to use, the third floor is the bedroom, the hostess and the male owner, the fourth floor, which is the top floor, living with their children and female tutors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basement is still the kitchen, the storage room and the laundry room, but the students can only use the laundry room, and the kitchen and storage room are the dean of the floor. And their assistants, as well as their families, are two- to four-story student dormitories, six people in one suite, two people in one bedroom, a shared living room, bathroom, bathroom, and wash and more* The places are all separated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishb and Sasha had the privilege of being assigned to the same suite, but not the same bedroom, because their provost thought that they were enough Familiar, "You need more new friends." He said, they were divided into two bedrooms, each with their own roommates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's it," Sasha said. "If something goes wrong, I will deal with it."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will pay attention." Besib said that Manchester's room is smaller than Grande's, and they have to squeeze in two people, they have to put a desk in two Between the beds, the other one was succumbed to the bed and the wall, and the two beds were close enough to hold each other. If Besib is unfortunately out of control, then his close roommate is simply a jar of meat that has been stripped of the outer packaging. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he hasn’t been swallowed up, then the next thing is Sasha, he has to revise the horrible memory in the first place— - Regardless of Besib, or for the unlucky guy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
