			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The anesthetic used by this hospital for the abilities is used in an ordinary person, it will definitely kill him, but for the abilities For the time being - it can only work for half an hour to an hour or so, and Sasha Hopkins never wakes up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who is his anesthesiologist?" asked Mr. Li. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," a small man raised his hand in a hurry: "It's me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Are you using this year's holiday?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," the little doctor blinked dumbly: "I am still divorcing." Procedure..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then use it," Mr. Li said in an unquestionable tone that the superiors used to say: "There are still next year, after Years... In fact, I mean, in a year, you don’t want to appear on the Western Continent for a while, go to the East China to play, there is a long history, simple folk customs, and only one-eighth of our per capita consumption. There are also delicious roast ducks and noodles."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..." I have to finish my divorce lawsuit and have to fight for the custody of my child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And the golden-haired people are very popular with the girls there - and you need a new relationship to soothe your injured little heart. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The anesthesiologist was full of doubts and touched the hairline of his crazy retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Li looked at other people, doctors and nurses. It is not easy for an organization to train a group of people, so he can’t risk putting them in one. In the face of a special recipe and a child who is mad, when the latter son is stunned for unknown reasons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I suggest that you also take a vacation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My vacation has been used "That's all right," said Mr. Li. "An extra order, I will give it to you." A meat dish on the table of Kings, we have the opportunity to press you to the last bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are full of confusion, everyone, but in the end they follow the meaning of Mr. Li. They work twice as much in this hospital than other general hospitals (taking into account the general income level of doctors, this is quite double ), and more holidays, as a return, they must close their mouths, control their fingers and bring a pair of ears to listen to orders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Li is one of the managers of the hospital, not to mention that he only wants them to take a vacation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After sending away a group of doubtful white robes, Mr. Li returned to his office, he stood in front of the glass window, the sky was already dark, indoor The bright light turned the glass that could cover the whole human body into a black mirror. Mr. Li found himself in it - he was a normal middle-aged man with grayish black hair and a big fat nose. And the rich lips, he has been broken sixty-five, but as long as he can be an adult, the physical age of the abilities is always more than half of his actual age - he is still energetic, quick-minded, if not, He is afraid that he can't keep himself, not to mention the younger brother who likes to drop the chain at a critical moment and the prostitute who is insane in a new way every day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After about two hours, his secretary and his brother called him to ensure that the stupid bunny had been sent to the nearest On a flight, God bless, as long as you have money, everything will become simple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When his phone rang again, the people over there told him that the helicopter from the Bissau family had landed on the top floor of the hospital. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Li gently stroked his hair against the glass, his ability to allow him to ignore almost all the damage, from the flesh to the spirit, but, No, he still doesn't want to face Hopkins, not because the doctor's recipe--swallowing his own kind of change.) There is no half a dozen and one palm in his hand. It is not because he is an abilities. God, my subordinates, my colleagues, and enemies are all powers, and there are many people who are so powerful that they think they have entered the myth or the world of comics. Although the people in the research department and the intelligence department have not been able to do so now. I figured out what Anthony Hopkins was, but he was really just a mortal with a flesh and blood. When he faced bullets, his defense was not as good as that of Chegal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is always such a person in the world that will make you cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
