			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room suddenly fell into a brief silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are no abilities around him? I mean, relatives, friends, subordinates, is there a person who is more valued by him?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." One person replied: "There are not many abilities."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" We can make the abilities," said the other. "It’s like Kemira."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. President’s parents, my parents are still alive, he There is a younger brother, two younger sisters, a wife, and three children, two men and one woman, one dog, one cat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Western traditional family Standard configuration," said a sardonic voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who do we choose?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The protection of the current first family of the President is limited to His spouse and his children, other immediate family members, regardless of their parents or brothers, are not on the list of protections - then the younger brother, or the younger sister? If the propaganda materials are true, the feelings between them are quite profound. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You also know that it is promotional material, no, in fact, our president and his brothers and sisters are in the same fire because his brother is a Homosexuals, and one of the sisters is a non-alien, and the second one is to shoot something that is not elegant, and sometimes he is also a pro-industry. When he is running for the presidency, they have pulled him a lot of hind legs, and the DuPont family almost Give up on him - if not for him to recover a lot of image points in a timely manner of "tolerance", "fairness" and "care for the family"."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" What about his parents?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No. He Too old, I can't stand the pain and disease caused by the mutation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Child?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "We may be able to successfully kidnap his son or daughter. The problem is that this will cause a great uproar."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't need that method for the time being - try the mites first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The locust is still a secret."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's not all right, the 'institution' has noticed - they are also looking for those who are severely ill after being bitten by mites, and who have a variety of strange reactions."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I thought that this secret can be maintained for a long time, how much have we collected?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"100 Fifty," said the respondent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are doing this very carefully," The man explained: "We can't let the locusts swept through a whole town or city, like the one in 1950 - but in 20,000 to 40,000, there are ten children or adults. Being bitten by a mites and causing a disease does not cause any attention. After all, there are grasses, trees and swamps everywhere - and ordinary people who have no abilities to trigger can only make a little red 疙瘩, slightly Hot."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So are you prepared to let our President also be bitten by a small bite?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "The age of the initiator is mostly a teenager. He is too old to be successful - but he has children."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He likes most Which one?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“We can’t control the locusts to bite.” The man continued: “But we all know that the president likes it every year. In August, I went to his farm with my family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There will be. From April next year to August, to this range, no We broadcast the children of our eight feet at a fixed time and place."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We may also have nothing to gain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "One year is enough, we can wait. If there is no response. We can take the first discussion - in short, Mr. President needs a reminder."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about 'institutions'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are not stupid enough to slap their own rap, in the understanding of the President, 'institution' Nothing is more noble than 'Samel'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, it seems that there is nothing worth discussing in this matter, going back to the previous issue - - Avery Famo's request."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course not, so he will spend the rest of his time on the silly head to the man Looking for trouble, we are worried about it. Money and human feelings have all become bubbles."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That was a sly boy, he noticed that we sent him into Manchester is for Hopkins, he is taking this to marry us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He doesn't know if we can let him bloom in the moment? Manchester It’s not just him alone.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;”His position is recent – ​​we can send him to jail. But It’s a bit difficult to get to the replacement, time flies, and it’s a year in a blink of an eye, and it’s hard for a person who goes to jail to stand up in the plaintiff’s seat in the courtroom. The person will be upset.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When does he want to pin this card?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who knows - President I have been working for three years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So there is another year, then...to him?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give him a year later. At that time we will have someone who is closer to Sasha Hopkins than he is. He remembers to work hard this year."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha Hopkins in Manchester did not know that he was being closely watched by others, and he was frowning at a group of people in cages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people occupy the main passage of the new dormitory to the outside world. Those cage railings are made of a combination of hollow aluminum alloy materials, and each person can assemble a bag that is six feet high. Three-foot-width and deep cages, the clothes that were taken off were placed neatly on the benches, the people inside the cages were naked, and their bodies were painted with red oily pens filled with demonic fetuses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
