			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello, Sasha Hopkins." The young man smiled nervously: "I don't think you have seen me." He coughed. One voice: "But I think you should be familiar with my brother... well, his name is Jack."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence can almost be said with a while ago The exact same opening words that Catherine had heard did not cause Sasha’s real attention. What concentrated him was the chilly and malicious, the child removed his own vision from a magnificent rose lace. He saw a A man who is about twenty-five to thirty years old, his hair is a little messy, his eyes are straight, and there is a small beard on his chin that is built into a thumb-shaped beard... He may want to imitate some A star or a fashion designer, in short, is a modern figure, but his facial features are too flat, and the skeleton of the face is too round and very childish. This beard does not add much to him. Charm, but it looks very dirty, it is like no overnight The steak sauce stains conspicuously stick to the man's face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, it seems that you don't remember very much." The man said with a false pleasure: "You are like your chop father...you It’s okay to forget things, it’s okay, it’s okay, I’ll take you to meet him, and you’ll be able to remember when you see him.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pushed the doctor away, Grabbed the handle of the wheelchair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha noticed that the doctor did not raise any objections - the man was allowed - to talk to him, approach him, before that, only fixed Doctors, nurses and Catherine and her new partner have this right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wheelchair did not turn to the road that Sasha was already familiar with. They walked for about twenty minutes and then entered another building, after passing through the square foyer. Passing through an elevator that requires a password and iris inspection, like most elevators in the hospital, the elevator is very slow, Sashaan is quietly in a wheelchair, and his eyes stay on the control panel of the elevator. After a while, count the number of buttons on the top of the heart, and then turn away without any traces. Stay on the closed elevator door. The elevator doors are two clean mirrored stainless steels that are wiped out. They reflect the sprinkles less accurately. The scene behind the sand, he can now see the nurse's chest to knee, as well as men's shirts and pants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gentleman’s taste is unflattering, not to mention the materials that can only be incorporated into synthetic fibers, in terms of color and pattern – blue The color of the bottom, the white sperm, the sand does not discriminate against this pattern, Bill Gates's closet also has a lot of coral red, light orange and vortex, but this pattern and color is not suitable This man, who is in a bad mood and obviously lacks self-control, will make his mood worse than the previous one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man gently shakes his body back and forth behind Sasha’s wheelchair. This action may be interpreted psychologically as impatience or anxiety, but if If you have a weird smile, you can only use it as an answer to your question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha thinks that it is not something that will make him look forward to it - he begins to miss his aunt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine’s new abilities were recognized and appreciated by the upper echelons of the organization, and a verbal warning revealed her dereliction of duty, betrayal and absconding, “black ritual” There are a lot of bonuses, and Sasha Hopkins has also received the best treatment and care: after receiving the last comprehensive physical examination, he can leave the ward deeply buried in the rock with someone accompanying him. Appreciate and feel the sunshine, the breeze and the fragrance of plants, or go to the game room and library, you can choose your favorite food and clothes, etc. In return, Catherine changed the indecisiveness of the past, almost can be said It is a kind of enthusiasm and even a devout attitude to invest in new jobs. There are many places that need her. Not only intelligence, but also the activities of some action groups need her participation. Many criminals are eye-catching, through some details. They can easily tell if someone will threaten themselves. Catherine has been cringing for the criticized weakness and became the best camouflage. There are already no more than half of the criminals planted under her fingertips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, in addition to the generous bonuses and the smile of the boss, the inevitable danger and pressure caused a lot of burden on Catherine, but she insisted on visiting Sasha every day (as long as she is here), she does not seem to mind. "Abandonment" before Sasha. In other words, this woman who has obviously evolved from fantasy to delusion does not think she has the ability to "abandon" her. But in any case, at least on the surface, she is still very good at Sasha. She told Sasha that when he was completely healed, she would temporarily entrust him to a private nursing home to look after. There are quite a few of them. Child, he can spend a good time of "carefree" there, but this is also temporary. After waiting for a year or two, when she handles some things, she will pick up Sasha, they Can live together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha translates these as: In the next period of time, he will move from one cage to another and get rid of the endless inspection. After the injection, the attacking children are more annoying and noisy than a group of Africanized bees. After Catherine or any other hunter in the organization kills Anthony Hopkins, Catherine will find a way to pick herself up. Go out and live with her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What a joke! God, Sasha does not think that she or someone else can kill her father, but she has indeed caused obstacles more than once. However, Sasha never regretted contact with Catherine... He knew that he needed a mother and longed for his mother. Catherine’s emotions are hot, sincere and surging, although this emotion can’t replace a mother’s innate love and responsibility, but at the very least, Sasha’s memory palace, that The mega-cavity that always exists and grows can use this emotion to temporarily make up and comfort. He must use this method to curb its expansion so that his reason and emotion will not be distorted or even collapsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just like the father’s hollow is filled by the mother and him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elevator suddenly opened in front of Sasha’s eyes, letting him go small The man behind him was shocked. He sneered at the sneer. He pushed the wheelchair out of the elevator. When he grabbed the handle, the fake cufflinks at the cuffs of the shirt slammed into the metal parts of the wheelchair, making a crisp sound. The echo in the channel. Sasha found that it was a straight, white, quiet and quiet walkway. From the inside out, there was a sinister smell, and even the wind blowing out of the air – although it is supposed to be fresh and warm But when they fall on people's skin, they still can't help themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wheels of the wheelchair are made of very good rubber, and the bearings are also oily, but when they walk in this corridor, they still make a sound... , drums, Sasha was pushed into the isolation room with double doors, the other end of the isolation room is an empty room, this room is very cold, full of people with itchy nose of the formalin solution The taste - although the vents on the top are always slamming, but the taste is still very clear, Sasha only smelled once or twice during Professor Anthony Hopkins's pharmacy (because of this The drug can cause a variety of diseases, Anthony Hopkins has been avoiding Sasha and it is too much contact) - the young man pushed Sasha through a shallow pool that almost occupies one-half of the entire room, deliberately The wheelchair stopped and let Sasha see what was inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a body that is neatly arranged in the formalin solution like the tableware to be cleaned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are familiar with this," the man smiled. "My dear little murderer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The end of the room also has a double door that allows the cart to enter and exit, leading to another, more chilly room with four stainless steel autopsy tables, each with its own balance and sink . Only one table was occupied, and the gray-white corpse bulged a long strip of hair that looked like a tumor on a dissecting table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man pushed Sasha to the front of the dissection table, and the wheelchair armrest hit the edge of the stainless steel frame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corpse was slammed open, the dead naked exposed to white fluorescent lights, bare bare feet tied to the mortuary toe tag - sprinkle The man’s face was preserved in Sha’s memory. His father investigated this person. He is Jack. He is a partner of Catherine, an employee of the organization, and a man who is still a little responsible. Perhaps it is for this reason that God bless, his body was hardly burned and destroyed, which has to be said to be a miracle in the fire of Alija. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look, look, you are a little ball." The young man snorted, he grabbed Sasha’s two hands from behind and pressed them To the dead: "This is my brother. He is less than thirty years old. He is not married, has no children. For ten years, he is for me to eat, dress, go to school, and rush into me every Monday morning." The room kicked my ass called me to get up, but now... look, you see, this is a good thing for your chop father." Sasha relaxes his body, does not resist, the power of adults is his irresistible His mellow, pink little finger was forced to press tightly on the dead Jack. He was bloodless, hard and cold, like inferior white marble. Sasha patrolled him shortly. A continuous, irregular rounded wound was found on the man's thigh. It had been cleaned up, it didn't look too deep, and the edge was slightly sunken, like a crocodile biting - Sasha's eyes flashed Mr. Anthony Hopkins’s fingers are slender and thin, but Very powerful, in his no-journal record of ten times, he used a plastic fork to kill a tall and burly guard, and he used his fingers and teeth to make a handle for himself - with a ballpoint pen A small piece of metal refill and a large paper clip; in the Amazon jungle, as his child, Sasha has seen more than once how he tore open the vines, dig the bark, break the beast's neck, or tighten The parts give them blood, and the traces left on the creamy flesh after the prey are washed and stripped are very similar to the former. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know how he died?" The young man squatted down, his face pressed against the hair of the sand, and the rancid smell from his mouth. Breath with the taste of poached eggs and ham: "The old beast who should go to hell broke his spine, broke his femoral artery, threw him into an empty room, so that he stayed alone. He is bleeding, desperate and waiting to die...but he is not dying because of excessive bleeding. He is suffocating, God, do you know the taste of suffocation?" His fingers pressed behind Sasha. On the neck, slowly close: "That's a wonderful thing, how about, do you want to try it too? I may not have the professional of your killer father, but I promise absolutely slow and painful, how?!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha’s head was pushed forward by him, and the light-colored hair was swept away on a thin body of frost. His head squats slightly, from this point of view, he can see the wound more clearly, the wound is deeper than it looks If it be broken open the femoral artery, then that person should not die so painful - short bleeding more than 1000ml, circulatory failure may occur around performance, blood pressure, unconsciousness, coma. When Sasha and Catherine left the hall occupied by the Mori mating group, her partner Jack was still alive, although Mr. Anthony Hopkins should have moved shortly after this, but the origin was unknown. The fire will not happen until at least ten minutes. At that time, the man had already known nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where will he go?" the young man suddenly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha’s keen hearing told him that almost everyone’s breathing stopped for a moment, and Anthony Hopkins’s child almost laughed. When he came out, he licked his lips and wiped out the curvature of the lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
