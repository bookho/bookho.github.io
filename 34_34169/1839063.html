			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha Hopkins - our little protagonist, no need to introduce more, Anthony Hopkins is his father, Besib. The land is his friend and the bloodless brother, Catherine is his aunt, the other is Catherine is his mother, these two are twin sisters, non-identical, because Catherine carries the whitening patient gene, this gene transmission Sasha was given, so the eyes of Sasha will be purple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is now a girlfriend for Lila, actually the girl was just asking him for trouble and later passing Anthony Hopkins’ "Modified", just exist as a personal bodyguard,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I usually refer to him as Sasha in the article, sometimes it is Little Hopkins, no In the case of Anthony Hopkins, he will sometimes be called Hopkins directly, and he will also call his son of the ghoul, the son of the doctor, the son of Anthony Hopkins, Besib. Unblooded brothers and friends, Catherine's nephew and the like. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He and his father’s enemies would marry him as a little monster, a little bastard, and that’s not much to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stefan, once a sly, called him the Messiah. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Hopkins - the protagonist's father, is a psychiatrist, with a mental patient and a murderous madman, very much before Sasha was born I like to use humans as raw materials for meat, and now I will occasionally reminisce about past food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Previously a sister, now a child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He and Sasha are pure father-son relationship, Sasha may be his sustenance, but he is not a juvenile widow, so the old ** He will be very happy to see that his domestic pigs will go to other people's cabbage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lila is in his eyes, even the qualifications for dinner main materials are not, he let Lila's body alive, just for the "institutional" head Reward and find a good bodyguard for your son. Lila, I mean the new Lila, not falling in love with Anthony Hopkins, but the moment she woke up, Anthony gave her such a deep hint - will you let your tools run outside without any embarrassment? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why she kissed the doctor’s foot is because the memory of the previous Lila is at work, and the sage of Baiyancheng, who likes women, kisses His feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The...there will never be a little stepmother...that is really...sweat<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Besib. Bisangdi - He grew up on Poseidon Island, and spent a decade or more with Sasha (later), his father originally wanted to use Hopkins and his son In particular, Sasha came to create a set of parasexual mobs for him. After all, because of their abilities, many people think that they are demons, and even the closest fighters betrayed Chekal Bissand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But recently, Chegal was a bit unhappy because he felt that the advantage between the two children was leaning towards the Hopkins side, especially in White Salt City. Besib was seriously injured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib and Sasha are good children, but their father is not, they can’t refuse the father’s request, but they will be tortured by conscience. There is a secret that cannot be known to third parties, so his relationship with Sasha will greatly surpass others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But between them is absolutely, absolutely, there will never be a relationship! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because both are straight and traditional, they don’t discriminate against homosexuality because they feel that they have nothing to do with themselves! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishb also counts on the sister flowers on the island of Poseidon with Sasha, and marries on the same day, doing the shackles! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishb also does not look at the nervous Lila, the reason why he said "I like her" is because Lila can enter the world without knowing it. The teacher's office sneaked in the exam, and he was about to get mad by the exam. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the article "I love you", "I like you" and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone knows that my article is based on it, except for a small number of people, most of whom are not afraid to express their feelings, sometimes Very exaggerated, was sent a pizza when hungry, "I like you." To copy a paper, "I love you." Helped, "I love you." I got a long-awaited Gift, "I love you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is just a way of expression, don't care too much, you can contact the context to see, it's easy to tell. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this usually only happens between close friends and relatives, they don’t scream at random people, I like you, I love you. Category. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talk about the kiss again, because I might write it later, so I will mention it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kissing cheeks - friends, relatives. Men will, don't be nervous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kissing Hands - for women, and for the godfather, respectful people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kissing the feet, kissing the robes - yes, very few. Chestnuts look at Lila in front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kissing lips - generally between intimate men and women, but if men, especially friends and brothers, the relationship between father and son is very good Also kiss the lips - not to be nervous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other way to kiss is to look at the place where the education is different. The interested adults can check the Brezhnev triple kiss - haha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holding doesn't have to be mentioned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sleep together - they start to sleep in bed from one year old to four or five years old, but boys and girls can sleep if they want to chat before going to bed. Together, only the nuns of the eighteenth century saw the two children sleeping on a bed and screaming loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Renamed questions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opening of the sinister arrow Martin and the back of Pikachu Martin are not the same person. Change it later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine and Catherine are a pair of fraternal twins. Catherine is the mother of Sasha, who has been dead for many years, and Catherine is his aunt and still alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two elders of John who have mastered one of the three keys in the sacred room and have abilities. Thanks to the reminder of saldin, the previous one has been changed. Calvin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
