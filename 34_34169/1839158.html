Somitre, hey, to be precise, is the counterfeit that uses the identity and name of Somitre. The information in the organization and the ealf organization is very clear. The real Hillenos Somitre died in the fir forest two years and three months ago. According to his wishes, his body was cremated. Throwing into the sea, his relics are handed over to his girlfriend, and he is also "the one in the world who loves and loves him the most, knows each other, recognizes and has enough courage and ability to inherit all his will" - written in The remains of a gray-yellow twilight recycled note are so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next Somitre appeared a month later. He used the name of the previous Somitre, and lived in the tattered apartment he borrowed. In, using his computer, ip, continuing the "work" and "career" of the dead, constantly contacting his friends and like-minded people, and ealf...ealf is not ignorant of this, but the new Somitre performance Outstanding, in less than a year, he has planned several large-scale operations in a row—for the horrific behavior of the unknown, inhuman and devastating animals in their animal research studios, they are in the university laboratory and movable. Explosive stolen goods were placed near the office; the president of the pharmaceutical company had a fire in the holiday villa in the Alps; the car in the city that announced the plan to build a large biological laboratory was smashed, the dock was set on fire; the medical school that carried out animal experiments Libraries and teaching rooms were held in the past few days, warnings were issued, and even the employees of the university were publicly detained; the bombs of the staff of the animal research company were sent to threaten letters, including: "Your little life in danger! "Whenever you leave the room and go to your car, your life is always at risk." "Don't expect to let your children go if you have children." It is easy to find out where they go to school and live. "Wait, the mother-in-law of the Huntington Laboratory (the company that cultivates the mouse) was dug out of the cemetery and threw the wilderness (the latter was completely re-buried after four years); even developed to use wooden sticks. And tear gas directly beats doctors, businessmen, teachers, and students or any other person who believes that they have abused animals. In the end, even ealf feels a little out of control is his plan, he plans to reduce inflammation in hundreds of tubes. Adding poison to the cream (the pharmaceutical company uses rabbits and monkeys for dermatitis experiments). Many parents use this plaster to treat small wounds in children – this plan was immediately stopped by ealf's top management, who asked for the new somi Trey awake his mind, but when he came to the door, they still protected him with silence.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The incompetent, wealthy and angry giants found the institution, and the rapid accumulation of bounty allowed the agency to take action within 30 days, but this Somitre was not very good to deal with - not to say how strong he was. In fact, it was too embarrassing for him. Every time the intelligence team could catch his tail, he could disappear in a blink of an eye. Later, the organization had to let the action group and the intelligence team act together. They were in an animal. The protectionist's party caught Somitre. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This goal was not very eye-catching. The problem was in the subsequent routine interrogation, this yellow hair, blue eyes (actually green eyes) Young people are actually related to "Samel." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Samel" was part of the organization five years ago, but its heads obviously have more complex and self-conceived ideas, and they are fighting with x Like the "Magnetic King" in the movie, he believes that human beings who have the ability to mutate are the "new hopes" of the world. He hopes to see more mutated human beings in their lifetimes, and their actions - no matter what crimes are committed His eyes are forgiven, and he thinks they will reach a balance after a period of time (God knows how long it is) (the devil knows what kind of balance it is) - after the Earth is covered by mutated humans . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is exactly the opposite of the intention of the organization - the organization is more focused on control and reduction, so after the power is mature, he glimpses the opportunity to split from the organization . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hides, like a cancer buried in the body of the body, in addition to the attack at any time, the organization has to worry about its enemies will not Will be the first to find this scar - and weaknesses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somitre was placed in the violent mental ward of the "Babel Tower", which was an extremely safe and secure place, no problem, of course, Everyone thinks so before things happen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but nine dangerous patients (criminals) including Somitre managed to escape (after turning the entire Babel tower upside down) ), the organization managed to find Somitre, but he once again slipped out of the "head" of the fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Head" squatted in the office and ate the new half-pound fresh flavored mixed toffee from Aben Enribe (coffee + Chocolate cola and peach milk), pressed the phone: "Called Abel and Catherine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only existing clues in the organization that can be traced back to Somitre are only Camilla. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kemira is missing, come back, maybe she will stay with Somitre during this time, she may know where Somitre is Or where to go. The bad thing is that she was dug up part of the brain, she forgot a lot of things, and the things of the previous period were even more blank, and the police did not have clear evidence that she was not a victim but an accomplice, and Kay refused and police Or the organization cooperated, they sent her to the sanatorium. This private sanatorium and the forest surrounding it are all Kay's. It is difficult for the police to be involved. It is fortunate that there are institutions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abel and Catherine, and several other members of the action group sneaked into the sanatorium. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They found Catherine without much effort, she was sitting on the terrace, wearing a light gray silk sling pajamas, she was very thin, on the shoulders The bones are wrapped around the skin, standing like a white mountain, solitary and exposed to the cold air of the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they suddenly appeared in front of her eyes, she just glanced at them indifferently and said "Good evening" and turned around. Catherine leaned slightly With a little head in mind, Kemira's green eyes are like a pair of bright glass balls, with a bandage on the head and shaved hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We don't have much time," Abel urged. "Hurry up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine Insert your finger into your hair and comb it back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stood in front of Kemira, then separated her legs and sat directly on her body, they were very close, breathing on the face, body temperature After the silk pajamas and cotton shirts passed each other, Catherine raised her hands and held Kemira’s face. Her face was so small, Catherine said in her heart, then she stretched out the thumb and rubbed Kemira’s cheek. Perhaps because of the oriental blood, Kemira's creamy skin is very delicate, the thumb rests on both sides of the bridge of the nose, pauses, gently presses under the eyelids, part of the eyeball is exposed to the air, Catherine leans over, The tip of the tongue poked out the lips and touched the surface of the eyeball - she tasted the tears, and the soft surface of the eyeball - the tongue slid down the curve of the eyeball, moving from the bridge of the nose to the tip of the nose, it fell on the lips On the top, Catherine forced her fingers to force Kemira to open her lips, and her tongue sneaked into it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kemira's eyes widened. She seemed to feel something wrong, but she only struggled a little. Now her strength can only be compared with the seven or eight-year-old child. She can't push Catherine for a few seconds. After giving up the resistance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An action group member hidden in the blind spot of sight narrowed his mouth and made a whistling fake move to Abel at the other end, in exchange for a severe glimpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entangled relatives between the two beautiful women look really tempting, but the reality is not so sweet - Catherine is just what the search agency needs The "memory" intelligence only - what can be used more, longer, and more meticulous than the human body itself? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a minute, Catherine ended her kiss, and she opened her eyes and quickly left Kemira. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's the harvest?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can we take her away?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you say?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is the Hillenos Somitre we are looking for," Catherine said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kemira hangs her head, she hasn’t been serious like this for a long time I have thought about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfamiliar contact is like stirring the hand of the pool, the memory is flooded from the point of deposition, some are fairly complete, and some are completely invisible. Some of them are just some scattered and unformed corners. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She remembers the feeling of the head being backed by the pelvis and muscles, remembering the first cold air sucked in after the birth, remembering the pale walk and the low voice of the father, Remember the red and gold brocade enamel, remember the bells on the wrists and bracelets on the wrists, remember that the sun is coming in from the glass window, and the golden warm squares are selected on the dark brown floor that is wedged, remembering the mother's The fingers slowly touched their faces, remembering that when they just learned to walk, they held the walls and chairs, sniffing the smell of the misty flowers in the air, eagerly looking for a mother in a room and a room... She found no, It seems that there is, there is no, the mother soon has a smaller child, she often walks in the hallway with her baby and sings softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She remembered that she extended her arm to her mother, but the mother just smiled and shook her head. "No, no, I am holding my brother." She said, then she called the babysitter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nanny took her back to the room, she hoped the nanny could also walk around her in the room, but the nanny put her on the bed and took off Her shoes, asked her to sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bed is large, the quilt is heavy, and her body is very cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She doesn't like her brother. Although the mother had never held her before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the younger brother and sister were born one after another. They have a lot of rights that she doesn't have, the most curious of which is that they will be called to see the guests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She tried to quietly follow her, the father found out that he was very unhappy, the mother was not okay, but she also went there once - the guests The strange eyes made her very uncomfortable. Bigger, she can hear people whispering: "Not like Kaisheng." Don't want to..." "Is it a Kay family? Don't give someone a private child."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stood in front of the large mirror for a long time, she felt herself Much like a mother. Except for the color of the eyes and hair, it may be because she has not grown up. When she grows up, her hair and eyes will turn black, as black as her mother. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; she always thought so, until she started school. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The children there have hair and eyes of various colors, her thoughts are ridiculed by the children, from the teacher where she knows where she is wrong, She escaped classes in the first week after school. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She returned home, smashed every mirror, knocked down the mother who came to dissuade, the mother fell to the ground, bleeding, she lost an unformed Little sister. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; father severely punish her, he beat her hands and buttocks with a whip, her pain lay in bed for a long time and know a lot before I do not know Things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she returned to school, almost every child had her own friends. For a while she didn’t know what to do – she couldn’t even keep up with their rhythm, they’re talking about their mother tongue, and When she was at home, she said and listened to another language. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After she was in high school, she was barely accepted by the people around her, instead of being alone forever, because she was more economical than other children. Many, I would also like to invite others to enjoy food, buy gifts or invite them to travel, and she is also very beautiful, she finally has her friends, they dance, sing, camp, party... but the trouble is followed Come, a boy tried to kiss her, moved after being rejected, another boy bravely helped her, they wrestled and then entered the game together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The father knew about it, and she licked the whip again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was immediately transferred to a private full-time boarding school with university preparation courses away from the 7th district. The drivers at the holiday home will come on time. And sent back, the whole holiday, she was imprisoned at home, nowhere to go. A lot of homework needs to be done every day. If it is not done, she will be canceled for dinner or corporal punishment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The life in the new school is also very boring, but fortunately, they have a good teacher, a middle-aged man with a serious look and gentleness. With a pair of approachable brown eyes, he is called Terry Seymour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Semur is responsible for their literature class, the children like him, he is intelligent, knowledgeable, communicative, patient, he is willing and good at listening, Can keep a secret. But this time Kemira is very accustomed to hide everything in her heart. The opportunity is an accident, and Seymour found her injury. As determined in 1974, he should report immediately to the local child protection department. Kemira didn't want to see her father go to jail, and didn't want to leave home—even if it wasn't as warm and beautiful as everyone else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Semur did not say anything at all, they became intimate, no, there is no male or female relationship between them, Samuel is like a perfect Father, or brother, he protects her, directs her, guides her - with his help, Kemira sees a new world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is increasingly reluctant to go home, unwilling to accept the so-called traditional education, she feels that from her father Kaishengguo, everyone in the family With hypocrisy and rotten taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her surname is Kay, but she has never really been regarded as a family. She tried her best to integrate, but she was always excluded. She gave up and wanted to go out, but she was pulled back rudely; no one wants to accept it. She, but equally, no one wants to let her be free. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All is causing her pain...She wants to get rid of them, but finds that she can do nothing. She has no deposits, no housing, no work experience, and no formal diploma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, and most importantly, she still loves them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She asked Seymour: "What can I do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is from the game Moore knew the existence of ealf, and at an anti-fur gathering, she met Hirenus Somitre. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She loves Somitre passionately, this passionate boy makes her feel that she is still alive, her presence makes sense for the world - but Her father, Kaisheng, is the opposite. In his eyes, Somitre was the garbage and dregs that lured his daughter to the path of depravity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under her advice, Somitre left New York City, they are still dating, seeing once every other week or two, at the motel In the room, they talk to each other, whisper, kiss, touch, do / love. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kimilla began to prepare for Prissis (teacher qualification), she wanted to be a teacher, so that she could completely separate from Kay. She will marry Somitre, they will have children, and she will have a complete home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one thought that death would be so fast and without warning. In the twinkling of an eye, Somitre disappeared in this world, he left her The only thing is a 70% new laptop, a half-year lease for a room, a box of inner and outer pants, a cupboard, a mattress and two blankets, a few simple sketches and half a box of soda crackers. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sat alone in the empty room for a long time, she was thinking about a problem, if there is no Kaisheng country, without her, then Sirenos Somi Will Trey continue to live? Instead of being pierced in the chest by the branches in the cold fir forest, breathing and desperately dying? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared to Kemira, Kaisheng, Hirenos Somitre is more qualified to live in this world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Symour continues to support her, but he recommends a more appropriate and safer approach, no surgery, no drugs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's just an experiment, if you like."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her body is integrated The wonderful characteristics of squid and blue grouper, she is able to change her gender according to her own will - as the gender changes, the muscles, bones and internal organs will change, she becomes another person, and this person is Hirenos Somitre. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somitre reappears in this world, younger, stronger, beautiful, and smarter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has done a lot of things, it’s worthy of people’s amazing reverence, he Standing on the side of the weak, roaring, nothing can shake his firm tenacious will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was captured by the agency, interrogated, imprisoned, but he managed to escape It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A voice, he is very clear, it is arousing his body and spirit The strength of the depths, he used this power to escape the stern prison - but it quickly disappeared, but he also wants to feel more, more, more, that omnipotent , omnipresent, omnipotent power! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is close to Streiff’s father and son as Kemira, he is They smelled a taste, a noteworthy taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His judgment did not go wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
