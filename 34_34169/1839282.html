			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can we have a new 'brother'?" asked the priest who had just taken out one of the three keys. He looked like he had four. In his teens, he respected the young man who was only one-twentieth of his age, bowed slightly and hung his head, but this is a very proud thing because only a few people can Hayman took the initiative to talk or speak before talking to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It will be." Heyman said that he looked at the middle-aged man who spoke to him with a loving look: "Although not now, his The eyes are still blinded, his tongue is stuck, his ears are blocked, his body is contaminated with black mud, and his heart is in the hands of the devil."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Then, let's tear away the blindfold, dig up the stuff that sticks to the tongue, remove the plug that blocks the ear, cleanse his body, and break the devil's paw."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not easy," Hayman said. "Money covers his eyes, the honey sticks to his tongue, the pride that blocks his ears, the dark mud that is contaminated with the body is called vanity, and his heart is occupied by dirty blood." He paused a little. "This is a difficult task. It is a test for us. It is also for him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of believers saluted them, and the two temporarily stopped talking. Hayman reached out and gently touched the forehead of one or two of them. He was very patient and waited until they walked far enough to start the next topic: "And those 'outsiders', are you sure that the eyes and ears around them are open?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No doubt, adults."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let your hands and feet pay attention, don't let them spread too open, outsiders The poison must be controlled. After all, there is a fragile and embarrassing part of us. Once infected, it is irreparable. We will issue notices to urban residents and suburban residents. The curfew time is advanced to 5:00 pm, and adults must ensure that the children leave. The school will be able to return home immediately. And our young people..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Every 'young person' has been thoroughly instructed and taught. And passed all twelve tests - they are smart and firm, enthusiasm and faithful; they are the most solid shield, they are the sharpest spear, they are the finest net." The older priest whispered : "The lost lamb can get milk from them. Honey, and snakes can only get charcoal and arsenic "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;"The ice cream is very good," Hayman said. "In addition, tell them that only tonight, if you find a viper, don't catch it. Just drive him away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why do they have to arrange the game at night?" Beppe said, his eyes wide open, in a dark green and shallow Looking for Besib in the green - the symbol of the Grand Rugby team is green. The team uniform is dark green, almost integrated with the grass field. The burning white light from the high-powered projection lamp passes through the thin rain curtain. Countless crystal dots flash like diamonds. They stick with the wind. On people's noses, eyes and lips. Beep groaned, "It's salty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because the world's largest salt lake is only a hundred kilometers away from here, where is the accumulation of six Hundreds of billions of tons of salt, so it is said that although the salt of the salt is not able to lift the air, when it is windy, some of them will float in the air and dissolve in the rain." With his eyes open, tiny raindrops hung on his fine eyelashes, like a row of beautiful little crystal beads: "As for why they want to arrange the game at night. Most of the important events in the Western continent are In this way, people can safely go to school, go to work and have dinner. The ratings of live programs can also be guaranteed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I saw Besib," Beppe said. "Now he looks really normal."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a quarter of the stadium's electronic display, in addition to the current weather conditions (black clouds have a lot of rain), time, date, score (temporarily still zero), etc. In addition, the middle screen also shows the players of each team in turn. Besib was the center c in the offensive line and the shot gave him a short pause. His strongness is outstanding among his peers. He is not dominant on the court. He can even be said to be a little short. His opponents and teammates are almost all over the age of 16. The development of two years has exceeded a lot, whether it is height or Weight - and this position is not as compelling or flattering as the quarterback responsible for the scoring, the pressure is not reduced, behind him is the quarterback, after the defensive pass, He had to smash the latter for at least three of the "boys" who were suspected of having polar bear blood - if he could, clear a veritable blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Sasha once said, the aftermath of the fierce collision in the rugby game is quite terrible, except for physical injuries, concussions, fractures, and even The most serious visceral rupture or the accident of the spine being broken, and one of the most important organs of the human body - the brain will also cause problems in the violent impact, there are already regular statistics showing that every 33,000 times with the skull In the relevant collision, there will be two hundred and fifty times of seriousness, which is equivalent to using a head to collide with a cement wall at a speed of forty kilometers. In fact, even small injuries that appear to be less serious can cause small cracks in the brain, accumulate less and become chronic diseases that cannot be cured throughout life. On this issue, the rugby management committee finally made some concessions after a long period of pretending (like the cigarette company is not willing to admit that smoking is harmful to the human body), they have developed new rules (such as the brain in the game) Players with shocks can't return to the game on the spot. They are also actively conducting further scientific research with universities and research institutions. And constantly urge the raptors of the football game not to cheer for the impact or make any encouraging expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in Sasha's view, the last one is simply useless. Without the impact, the players will not get the points. The audience will feel uninterested. The explanation is even more difficult. This was originally a tower of glory built with flesh and blood. Sports, every impact is a high tide - successful defense, successful breakthrough, successful touchdown, what can make tens of thousands of people in the cold night rain waving blood fists like a madman like a loud violent Howl? Only impact, impact, and impact! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of Sasha’s brief distraction, the players on the field had stirred together, and Grand’s uniform was dark green, while White Salt City Ball The team's uniform is red, and the venue is like a pot of spinach and tomato salad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishb jumped up while kicking the ball on the defensive side. He knocked over two defenders in one go and then overturned his shoulders. Three, the quarterback receiving the ball swiftly rushed out of the gap that he smashed. He ran across half the pitch and he threw the ball, because most of the defender’s power was Sib's offensive line was entangled, and Grand's squadron could be said to have received the ball with his hand up and successfully scored the next second. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grande scored six points and had another chance to score. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a minute or two, if you have enough coffee to drink, you probably haven’t finished drinking it yet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little Hopkins stands in front, back, left and right, hysterically standing up and shouting Grande’s name until Grande is thirty When the position of the code kicked the ball, they barely sat down. The surrounding air was damp and hot. Sasha put his finger into the neckline and pulled it gently. The supporters of Baiyancheng have been rhythmically shouting ".Strange Jacob" (the name Sasha heard only this afternoon), and "Brave and Glory" "Hallelujah", with the grid Rand's supporters compare their dress and behavior to be more uniform, red jackets, black pants and black raincoats (Sasha notices that there are very few women, or simply say, no.) Their The shouts may not be high enough and sharp, but they are as steady and tidy as the tides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, it’s bad," Beppe said. "They lost the ball."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bai Yancheng team got the ball and their supporters stood up from their seats. The voice of "Hallelujah" suddenly rose, and an agile red dress quarterback ran on the slippery grass field. In the case of interception - he jumped up, it is hard to believe! A big man who is more than six feet tall can jump over the shoulders of others. He not only escaped from the encirclement of Grande, but also successfully created the first casualty of the game. When the White Salt City quarterback fell His knee hit a player's chest and his rib was broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
