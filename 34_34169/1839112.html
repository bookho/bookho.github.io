			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorry, I was suddenly notified of a business trip, I thought I would be able to come back soon, and the result was delayed for several days...<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Catherine "talked" with her head, she got a long "vacation", and the FBI and Like other bureaus, this kind of vacation is almost synonymous with “untrustworthy” and “unreliable” in the organization; in contrast, Sasha Hopkins was transferred to the “guardian” after the old and new injuries were basically healed. - This "guardian" is not what Catherine described at the beginning, the place full of pink balloons, sunshine, creek woods and cream cakes - it is located in the underground of the hospital, that is, in the rock, The official name is "Epburn State Psychiatric Center g District (Violence Ward)". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Hopkins lived in many cells and wards, and made him remember in addition to the state Baltimore crime that made him know the mother of Sasha. Outside the violent ward of the Psychiatric Hospital, there is probably only the supermax prison where he had been lucky enough to stay for a while nine years ago. One of the most rigorous places in the world, the so-called Extreme Prison, is located in a huge desert. There are more than a thousand remote-controlled steel gates, and all kinds of 24-hour working or light or dark monitors are everywhere. In addition to the high walls and barbed wire in the prison, there are a large number of guards carrying police dogs day and night patrolling. It is difficult to enter, and it is almost impossible to come out. The object of the custody is limited to those scums in the scum, such as drug smugglers, war criminals, gangsters, and so on. Anthony Hopkins didn't tell Sasha how he fled there - in fact, the prison did not disclose to the outside world that they had taken this crazy "ghoul" - in any case, they just got their place Anthony Hopkins hopes that the lesser the better, the better, and the supermax prison can continue to maintain its no-jail record. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha saw this cell in the bottom of the core cell area in the memory of his father, nine feet wide, nine feet deep, in the cell There are concrete tables, beds, small stools, toilets, small shower heads and a washbasin. A small black and white TV (screened TV show) hung on the wall of the cell. In order to prevent the TV from becoming a target for prisoners to vent, it was sturdyly covered by a cover. One end of the cell is connected to the corridor through an iron gate, and the other end of the wall has a 1 meter long, 10 cm wide window. Lying in bed, through this small window, prisoners can see the prison yard, but apart from the sky and the birds that accidentally land on the prison roof, they can no longer see any signs of nature. Three meals a day and letters were sent to the prisoners by the guards through the window on the iron gate of the cell. No phone, no network, no visits, the prisoner spent a full 23 hours a day in a small cell. There is almost no chance to get in touch and talk with people - there is an hour of wind blowing every day, but it can only be limited to conversations - even shaking hands is impossible, because the windy courtyard is separated by a barbed wire, one per person It is like a chicken farm that raises cockfighting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Anthony did not explain his escape process in detail with Sasha, Sasha could at least guess the difference - his father used to be still in custody Supermax's prisoners have expressed unusual sympathy on him - they may not be able to watch TV in the future, and it is difficult to get a chance to talk to prisoners. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha does not know if his father will sympathize with himself, because the room he is in now is worse than the supermax cell that his father showed to himself. It's not that it's dirty or dark, cold. This white room doesn't have an iron fence, no doors, no windows, no TV, no internet. The only place that can communicate with the outside world is in front of the entire room. Wall, exactly, this wall is a piece of glass, the glass can be unidirectional, two-way visible, or a part of China Unicom inside and outside the wall, and a small space behind the glass. Behind it is an electromagnetic door that will never open at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound insulation of the room is equally excellent, except for the music played from time to time, Sasha can't hear anything. When he was lying on his own small bed, he could only see the milky white walls and the lights on the ceiling. The lights here were set in the atomized glass, bright as white, and never extinguished overnight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;supermax prison has set a good record of 20 prisoners being murdered or committed suicide, and seven prisoners go crazy, Sasha believes that this can be done as well - even Can do better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the average child, or even the average adult, is forced to look forward to being in such a place, it may soon be hysterical, yelling or It is a direct mental breakdown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha has no such concerns at all, and his brain also has a palace of memory that is no less inferior to his father Anthony Hopkins, regardless of When and where, as long as he is still conscious, he can enter into a world that is more beautiful and free than dreams; and he knows that the beasts imprisoned in this underground lair are far more than one, he can't see them. They couldn't smell them, they couldn't hear them, but they could recognize their intense and vivid emotions. Martin's electric shock brought pain to his body, but further expanded his ability, his "tactile". Become sharper and more precise: for example, what he could feel in the past is as invisible as the flow of air, unable to hear or grasp, then now, even though thick walls and densely covered inside and outside the glass Current, he can also feel the emotions flowing inside, and just like people can see objects with temperature through the heat detector at night, he can also distinguish each person's position from the contour of emotion. Set and fuzzy personal conditions - anger, anxiety, depression, confusion, nervousness... Some of them are like a roaring flame, some like the waves that constantly slap the wall, and some are like heads The beasts, they are all trapped in a small, confined room, unable to move! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go out! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Escape here! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kill them and kill everyone! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the guards suddenly approached the monitor, and this awkward move caused The attention of the companion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's wrong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look," the former pointed at a small screen Shadow: "Look, he seems a bit uncomfortable." He was referring to Sasha Hopkins, the child curled up under the thin sheets, and they could clearly see his body getting smaller and smaller under the cloth. Suddenly twisted open, and then tumbling and shrinking, like an invisible big hand staring at him - another guard looks serious, his hand on the emergency call button on the waist . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait a minute," the third man stopped him: "Don't be impulsive, don't do anything until you really understand what's going on." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But he looks very painful. And...that is a child."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You The time here is too short.” The stopper stared at the screen and picked up his arm: “You will never know what a damn thing is hidden under the shell.”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
