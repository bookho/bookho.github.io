			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A girl was picked up by Boa from the starting platform, she took a few steps, did not stand still, fell on the cold and hard ground, her When the ankle was raised, it hit the support of the starting platform, and it hurts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Sorry." Boa said with no sincerity, stepping on the anti-skid countertop of the starting block - coach Marcia saw it, she stopped. The preparation of the order is like going over. The girl had already stood up under the help of her companions. She was blushing and her eyes were filled with tears. She first waved her hand to Miss Marcia, then shook her head and whispered to her companion. "She's fine," her companion yelled angrily. "Please continue, Miss Marcia."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Marcia hesitated for a while and walked back. His face is gloomy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I said, why do you want to condone him like this?" The girl’s companion said: "If I just look at that face, I think Hopkin It’s even more cute.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl wrinkled her mouth and didn’t speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as they spoke, the treasure that occupies the Hopkins lane has broken into the blue water, Sasha. Hopkins's departure was one second or two seconds slower than him. He caught up with Boa when he touched the wall. In the second half of the game, the two men went hand in hand and won by Boa in the last fifty feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bao rushed out of the water and grabbed the lever used in the backstroke, breathing loudly without expression, his eyes were blurred, his fingers almost lost consciousness. No one noticed it, but he knew that in order to steal Hopkins, he took the risk on his way back. He arbitrarily lowered the frequency of ventilation, and changed every five movements. This behavior is very good. It may cause hypoxia. The blood with too low oxygen can not supply the brain and the heart. Boa numbs his limbs when he sprints. He knows that the worst consequence of this is sudden death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is dangerous. Not only for himself, but if he had something wrong, Miss Marcia would not blame. But he is Boa, he doesn't care what will happen in the future, he just needs now - he is the best, everyone must admit it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Marcia walked over, her feet were as wide as the palms, and the whitened skin soaked in the water was on the shore. It was impossible to change back. She stood on the steps of the starting block and fell down. "Boa?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boa has a dim sum, he hopes that Miss Marcia has not found his little movements, and passed the most uncomfortable moment. His spirit and body are much better, and his vision is gradually becoming clearer. Miss Marcia’s toes are close at hand. She never applies nail polish to her fingernails and toenails, but she finely trims her nails and removes dead skin. With barbs. Then use a polishing rod to throw the nail surface into a sparkling crystal. Her toenails are very healthy. From the translucent cuticle, it is a healthy pink. Boa likes this color most. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am the first?" Boa knows why, his eyes are sparkling, and the light blue iris that seems to be a little cold and cold is also brought a little. heat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"First." Miss Marcia said she waved backwards. It is indicated that Boa can come out of the pool, and Boa ignores her. He continues to soak in the pool of water that smells disinfectant. Until Miss Marcia personally took him out, his arm rested on Miss Marcia's neck, her cheeks against her shoulders, proud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boy next to Hopkins made a vomiting fake: "It’s terrible, he thought he was a few years old?" He shook his head. Knock off the drops of water on your hair and mutter. "God bless, why do we have to put up with this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course," another boy lamented: "For our lovely herbal tea, essential oils and preserves." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins blinked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Grande Boarding School has a total of seventy-three clubs, including a squirrel club that is fascinated with feeding wild squirrels and a noble, knowledgeable and united bread and bread group. Each community can get the part of the support that comes from the good income generated by the school's permanent foundation. In contrast, they can't just eat and work, and every club has to come up with results, sports clubs, such as Rugby and swimming are simple. They only need to perform regularly, and then they get back to the enviable things in intercollegiate competitions, state trials, national competitions, and even world competitions. Other clubs are more troublesome. Unwritten rules, no matter what the nature of the community, have to participate in several large-scale voluntary services every year - for the community near Grande or Grande, it is necessary to hold regular exchange experience to improve the quality of the event. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Squirrel Club organized several lectures and photography exhibitions on feeding wild squirrels last year, and the crust meal group also opened a special gathering for no less than three times for students. We introduced the crusts and pizzas from all over the world, and we can taste them. Although there are courageous people... The Association of Explosives and Pesticides Research Engineers and the Manhole Cover Defects Observation Group have also produced quite striking results, but One of the most popular among students and residents is the product provided by the “Deepwater” club created by Dr. Douglas, the head of the medical school, which is a wonderful crystallization of flowers and fruits based on ancient methods and the latest technology. Herbal tea, fragrant essential oils and perfumes, delicious sweet preserves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No additives, no preservatives, pure natural, handmade, people are eager to get. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, no matter which kind of production is very low, after all, Doctor Douglas has only a small piece of land in Grande boarding school. In addition, because of the demanding conditions, the members of the "Shenzhen" club have never exceeded ten (alternatively with Douglas and his assistant doctor Jane), and most of them are also responsible for their heavy studies. It can be said that they are already very Efforts have been made, but the finished products are only temporary enough to supply some of the people inside the school... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha lifted the glass and stared at the yellowish tea for a while, putting it aside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How, don't like?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I still prefer pure soda." Turn your head and go, "Add some ice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Add lemongrass? Milk?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "No, except for ice, don't add anything." Sasha said that at this time he appeared to be more self-willed than Boa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," Jane said: "You won."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doctor Douglas has long been Remind her that Sasha Hopkins is a vigilant and picky little guy. He won't put everything he sees in the mouth like other kids, so the last doctor gave me only two copies. Rose Heather Tea Bag: "At least he can take it back and use it as a scented sachet." The beautiful man of dark hair said that while playing with her fingers, his fingers were whiter than her, almost translucent. The aroma and color of flowers and fruits often remain on the tips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be alert and critical, and proud, although he has never been as arrogant as Boa, but Jane can see that few people here have been put by him. In the same position as himself, including Miss Marcia and herself - he completely ignores the eyes of others, holding the crystal ice and small in the encirclement of many pale yellow ochre teas with a charming fragrance. Small round glass with bubbles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The individuals in the group will show obvious herd mentality. Some children will not be accustomed to the bitter taste of herbal tea at the beginning, they prefer sweetness. Fruit juices and popular carbonated drinks can be swallowed in a "deep water" courtyard surrounded by flowers and vines and high-grade students. They will inevitably pick up the cups and endure it with a mouthful. Of course, they quickly You will find the benefits, but this is a follow-up - this psychology rule does not work for Sasha Hopkins, he broke the curse, two children have been stunned for a while, they It seems that I also want to order soda water, Boa makes a sneer, and they are back down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Would you like some coca?” Boa asked. “That can also add ice, or you can add a slice of lemon.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most people remain silent Only a few loyal followers of Boa made a slight laugh. They are basically the ninth grade students who are new to this year. They are still in the age group that allows others to be tolerant and forgive their stupidity and innocence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha put down the cup, and now Little Hopkins has rarely had the patience of accompanying the screaming puppy, he looks directly Jane: "After 1914, or after 1914?" A recipe has always been a secret. A few years ago someone claimed to have found this super secret formula in the coca literature, including : 6 kinds of sesame oils such as caffeine, vanilla, cocoa, citric acid, lime juice, caramel and orange, lemon, cardamom, cinnamon, coriander and orange blossom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this recipe is true, then it must be in 1914 or even later. As we all know, coca was born in 1886, a morphine-addicted pharmacist made a non-alcoholic deep red mixed drink, which contained - at that time, it was not divided into the ranks of drugs, it was like a skyrocketing It is recommended as a kind of high nutritional value brainwashing drink, which can control the hysterical and melancholic diseases that were popular at that time, and can also cure headache, toothache, neuralgia, alcoholism, boat, hay fever and syphilis. People believe that the truth is now unrecognizable, but the inside is genuine, it has tens of millions of buyers and advocates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The frenetic coca wave was not curbed until the Western Confederation’s release of the Purification Drug Act in 1906, and Coca had to give up adding to the drink. Cocaine, but they will still buy coca leaves to make spices in beverages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1914, it was finally completely regarded as a banned drug, and the public opinion of the society began to tilt toward its unfavorable side, so Coca leaves also The coca drink disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha and Besib are also ninth graders, but their understanding of this school is far from that of the lovely ordinary freshmen. In the information, the “Sham Shui” club once restored the coca in 1886, but it did not launch, but it did provide teachers and a very small number of students for a short time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a warning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
