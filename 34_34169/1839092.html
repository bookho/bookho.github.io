			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine didn’t understand what it meant by Sasha. She just reflexively wanted to stop her from thinking about the things that had caused her pain and humiliation, but It turned out to be counterproductive. Sasha’s words were like a key. She opened the door. The black hole in the room opened. The naked intimidation, insult, and injury were like the pigs in the cold storage. All the scars were inside. It is clearly turned out and displayed to everyone in the cold mist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the orphanage, she was isolated and bullied; when she went to school, her lovely face and clever minds gave her some appreciation and kindness. But the good times didn’t last long. The children in the orphanage also went to school. They continued to chase and laugh at her and introduced to everyone “the little madman who didn’t have a sister”—because she would cry or yell for no reason— - No one knows what it is for, and no one wants to know. The vicious atmosphere continued until she finished her high school and went to another state to study at the university. Because she was isolated from the normal social circle for a long time, Catherine was very unfamiliar and timid in dealing with others, while others I feel that she is both lonely and indifferent, and it is difficult to get close, although she is really beautiful. When the university was about to graduate, she tried to make a boyfriend, and the result was an imprisonment and compulsory treatment for a violent violent ward and a state mental hospital violent ward for one year and four months (reverse binding suit, Mouth, calming agent) - she grabbed a guy from the guy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This special resume makes her barely find a job, and many places would rather hire a man with a criminal record than a small violent psychiatric history. There is a stage in the girl's dealings. She lives in the worst part of the state, doing the most tired and dirty, the longest work, being robbed, beaten, or being humiliated by such intense violence. ... every time it hurts, no matter the body or the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s easy to find the heaviest scar because it is the earliest, the biggest, the deepest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a six-year-old sister with blond hair, purple eyes, and white skin with soft pink in the sun. She calmly said to Catherine: "Goodbye."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was held by the adopter and went to the black car with a white curtain behind the iron gate of the orphanage, from the beginning I never looked back again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine never saw her again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The violent and sharp pain hit the priest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He’s pale face was suddenly sunken, blood flowing from the corners of his mouth and the corners of his eyes, hands and feet shaking like those hit by high-voltage currents, Zhang Open, swinging in the air, the Bible and Sasha fell at the same time, his tall body fell backwards and fell straight into the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original Catherine, who had half body immersed in the water, fell back and fell behind, almost colliding with a wide flat crocodile tail. The black Amazon River. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the initial chaos, she saw something shining in the water, it was the hair of Sasha... or the body, Catherine couldn’t think of it. Too much, she swam to the child, took her leg, lifted her up first, and then herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She breathed in painful pain, calming her lungs that were about to explode, squinting at the nearby water, a wide-brimmed hat sitting alone on the water Turning around, two or three crocodiles are circling around, yes, it’s the cruiser, just like the plainclothes guards around the Queen, their glowing eyes are looming in the dark, the ebony-like body floating on the river, without attacking Catherine. They did not sink into the water in accordance with their habits and waited for the next prey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine's hair clung to her cheeks and neck, obscuring her sight while making her feel at least restricted. She stepped on the water, put the sand on her shoulders, and let out a hand to put them all. Go to the back of your head. Sasha didn't look too good. She coughed in a low voice, her brows wrinkled, her shoulders gathered toward her chest, her hands clasped Catherine's head, trying not to let herself fall again; the crocodiles swam quickly. Help, they carefully picked up Catherine and Sasha on her shoulders and sent them to a bridge that had not yet been fired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, Sasha sneaked a few words, Catherine’s ears filled with water, creaking, not able to hear, just put it When the child was shocked after the proverb. She rested on the wooden base of the trestle for a while, twisting her body off the coat, replacing it with the rescue rope, and tying the sand behind her, moving her hands and feet and starting to climb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She didn't pay attention behind her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The water there is rolling like a boiled milk coffee, a lot of foam is stirred up from the turbid liquid and presented under a snowball-like moon Exciting pink shine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha knows that today is a bit overloaded, the body of the child is temporarily She still can't fully support her ability, and just now, she was lucky enough to act as a middleman to amplify and purify Catherine's most intense pain and hatred and pass it on to the priest, just like a regulator "wrongly" If the excessive voltage is input into an electrical appliance, the electrical appliance is burned out, but the voltage regulator is also uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, she also issued an order to the strange Mori - it would search for the priest's body and then swallow it. This strange and unpredictable character, Shasha, always feels that it is safest to store in the stomach of Mori. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is that, like all horror movies, the protagonist is always free. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha puts his face on Catherine's wet back, feeling the twisting and stretching of the muscles, and the purple eyes that look closer to black in dim light. Watching the boiling water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only is Mori, even the crocodiles have joined the siege, but Sasha sees Samson in a vestment (Note 1 ), the Amazon River and the land seem to be no different to him. If it was not the previous pain that made him move a little slow, then the crocodiles should follow the footsteps of Mori, and honored to be qualified by a priest to open a laparotomy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They can't get rid of him, Sasha knows it well, can only delay a little time - so although Miri is nearby, but still She was stopped by her stern drink - she did not remind Catherine who was doing her best to climb up, just like Samson, who was cut off by her wife and took power, would not give her a second chance to betray, the priest also They will not give them a second chance to easily get close. As for the other, whether it is speed or strength, Catherine can't compare with it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To deal with this guy, there are others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine finally got his face and body attached to dry, rough asphalt When the bridge was over, the excited heart jumped out - for a few minutes, she thought she would never reach a place where she could be down to earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was lying there like that, twisting her head, about a few hundred meters away, the first tower of Ariawu is still burning, the flame from that being The mating ball of the cockroach collapsed between the roof and the window. Several large main structural columns illuminate the red light under the shadow of the heavy fire wall. The original furniture, decoration and embellishment are all pleasant and joyful. Almost burned out; a burning hammock flies out of the window, rolling up in the hot air vortex created by the fire, and the ignition star is lifted by the wind, just like the goddess of spring throws flowers to the earth, the flame When the flower bones fall down there, there will be large and large pieces of golden red red ruined flowers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
