Kings."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Hopkins shook his head slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I recommended you." She snorted and screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, you recommended me." Hopkins does not deny this, he moves slightly, and stands on the next two steps of the sea Fna was staggered so that Marlene could clearly see her face: "But it is Mr. Gucci. Hefner who paid me a salary."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence Like a heavy punch, it hits the face of Marlene's wrinkles straight. "I shouldn't have come to you," she said, revealing a jagged tooth, full of sadness and remorse: "I thought You can help me, I didn't expect to be bitten by you." She stood up and avoided the pursuit of the light beam, as if she was flustered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is only the devil except God," Hopkins and kindly reminded: "And you are just a mortal, oh, of course, After deleting those unusual ambitions and desires."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am really unlucky, my lover, my husband, my daughter, my friend ...all of them are damn, betrayal of miscellaneous..." Malinna groaned incoherently, the beam of emergency light stayed under her chest, her face and feet hidden in the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing to say," Hefner whispered in a low voice: "A sudden new evidence, Marlena, but unfortunately it is not a lawyer, it is Dedicated to the prosecutor, your crimes are aggravated, shameless and cold witch, you are killing your own daughter!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am your wife! Her mother! I have the right to dispose of her - a disobedient kid! It doesn't matter, I can give you one more, two or more, a daughter who is as beautiful as her, and a son, you don't always want Son?... Wait a minute! Don't shoot! I can save her!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hefner hesitated, the finger pressed on the trigger was slightly loosened One thing: "...you said you can...do what?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course I can, I can take it away!" Marlena is almost swearing: "Is she still not dead? Give me five seconds, I will let her heal, as healthy and beautiful as before!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hefner unconsciously leaned his head slightly, hoping to get some hints from his trusted psychiatrist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He made a mistake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malena struggled to come up, at the moment when Hefner’s line of sight and the muzzle were no longer concentrated on her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hefner immediately pressed the trigger, the gun rang, not only, the bullet passed through the body of Marlena, but at the same time, Marlene had already knocked down He, she kneels on him, like a wolf holding her prey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emergency light fell, and the white light beam shook between the ceiling, the wall and the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman took out the browned teeth and bit the man’s throat, the blood spilled, moistened the chapped lips – the cursed miracle appeared again, and Marlene turned Restoring the original youth and health - she rides on Hefner's body, she has a full chest, her face is ruddy, her eyes are bright like gems or stars. "You are delicious, nutritious," She said: "My dear husband, you have the vitality that no one else can match. Maybe you could have lived to a hundred years old." She sighed pretently. "No wonder you are always excited... Oh, you. I should thank you, I remember that you once wished to die in the arms of a young, pure and beautiful girl. Now, although there is a slight deviation," she reached out and grabbed the face of Hefner’s dryness like a orange core, followed by a series of A fast and continuous impact - Hefner's skull slammed on the marble floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Women, the devil..." Hefner intermittently, vaguely spitting out extremely exciting and dirty words. And Marlene returned with a loud laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadow on the wall swayed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Standing there, Mr. Hopkins," Marlene ordered without fear, holding Hefner’s gun in her hand, gun There are bullets in it, and insurance – of course, is open, she has never been proud of her: “The situation is reversed.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't think so." The ghoul groaned, he could say that he was gracefully stepping into the darkness on the left side, the bullets passed through the air, and Anthony Hopkins slammed in front of Marlene. He lifted an elongated leg and kicked Marlene's jaw accurately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very neat kick, compared to the wwe (American professional wrestling) heartbreaker (the star of the game, one of the nirvana is the jaw crushing kick) Nothing was inferior. Marlene rolled down the stairs for the second time. The gun in her hand was opened because the finger hit the wall. The jaw was broken at least three times. She fell on Bonnie’s body. Bonnie didn’t say a word. throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe I should warn you in advance," Hopkins said as he crossed his employer: "I am sorry."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malena struggled to get up from Bonnie’s body, her elbows lingered wildly, completely ignoring her body and her vitality, dying Sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins found that her distorted face was recovering, so he picked up the gun on the step and went to her abdomen, the sun's nerves. The spot took a shot, and Marlena mourned. She endured the pain and raised her lips. She wanted to get the last help from Bonnie, who was lingering. Just like the last juice in the lemon, she sucked it wholeheartedly. The head is spinning fast - can she use Hefner to intimidate Hopkins? The founder of a color/love magazine may have no weight, but she knows that Hefner is standing behind a huge organization, and they are not happy to see a successful agent suddenly die for some unexplained reasons, no, No, Hopkins will choose to kill her to destroy the mouth. He can push Hefner’s death to her. The same is true. Although he can be said to have committed a crime of malfeasance - he still killed. Is that the culprit not? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what should she do? Now, Marlene couldn't help but repent and she didn't leave a trail. She claimed that she was dead. A blond girl from a remote town who had no reason to use it instead of lying in the coffin, could she manage to age for a while. When Hefner dies and Monica loses her ability to act autonomously, she should be able to inherit that huge legacy as a guardian - she will disappear as soon as she gets the money... maybe she can and Hopkins Negotiate, she can be half-divided with him, it is an amazing big number, he will consider... At the very least, he has to consider for his own children, he loves him, he is willing to give him the best, and he also Yes, just keep silent until she completes all the procedures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will agree, you live in this world, you can't afford money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A warm hand was placed on Marlene’s neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She squinted in confusion, when did Sasha Hopkins appear here? She didn't notice it, but she quickly dropped the idea and became happy. She can hijack this child! If Anthony Hopkins doesn't want his child to consume his remaining life in a few minutes - he has to listen to her - what should she say, ordering Big Hopkins to commit suicide or forcing him to admit that he is himself Killed Hefner and Bonnie? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the way, she had to ask for his password before he died. All, she is very clear, people like them have some secret accounts that can be cashed or transferred as long as they are reported. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You said," Sasha Hopkins said: "You want to feel the power again, right?" His front teeth are still Did not grow out, talked about the wind, it sounds ridiculous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tidal wave is rushing, but in a breath, it engulfs Marlene, it is so gentle, it is such a hegemony, it is from the eyes, The nose, ears, mouth, and even every pore rushed into the body of Marlena, which caused the skin to be hot and the blood to boil. It tempted and guided the ability of the body to move around – they broke through the shackles and shackles. Everything became uncontrollable, and the vitality that had infiltrated into the body suddenly increased to a terrible point—the narrow passage could not carry so much... Too much, it overflowed, just like the real water, it was facing The place that lacks it violently rushes away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie trembled, she was taken away, and now she is back, her muscles are tightened, her skin is smooth and smooth like porcelain, bloody Returning to the cheeks and lips, the white, hard teeth grew out of the pink gums, and the broken bones moved to the correct position under the traction of unknown forces, and the pierced parts began to heal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want her to be alive?" She heard Hopkins say this. No one has ever heard her voice shivering like the current Doctor Hopkins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha did not say anything, but Bonnie thought he should have nodded something because she was not hurt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
