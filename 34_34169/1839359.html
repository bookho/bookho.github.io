			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ps: This is the second more today...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mike and Famo’s people Joined the funeral of Ferrola Famo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the week’s vacation, Mike applied to the Secretary for the rest of the paid holiday, the Secretary agreed, but he did not go on holiday, and In a private investigation of the Ferrola Famo case, he asked Jesse to help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am willing to help you," Jesse said. "But you have to know that this is very dangerous. You are not in that area, you will be fired." She suggested: "You can ask a private detective."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have to do this myself," Mike said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are the words that the Ferrola agent said?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," Mike said "In fact, I don't believe what he said - it's not the style of Ferrola." He said: "I have to figure out the whole thing, otherwise I will sleep for the rest of my life."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His little gestures were quickly discovered in the area of ​​the Ferrola case, and they angrily fell on Mike’s desk for evidence of cross-regional investigations. To this end, Mike’s vacation was cancelled and he was ordered to return to work immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mike had to give up the investigation for the time being. But all the "useful things" were still held tightly by him: "The bald little dwarf is lying." He and Jesse said, his eyes were deeply recessed, his skin was grayish, his voice was hoarse, and he looked The kidnapping of the children’s boxing match is even worse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sneaked out to find more clues while patrolling, Jesse gave him a cover, and the director changed his partner to Mike two weeks later. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Secretary asked me to come to see you." The new partner said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The director told Mike that the murderer who killed Ferrola Famo had caught it, and they had already confessed their crimes, the whole process and the agent of Ferrola said The same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mike and Jesse said that he has found new and powerful clues. The blacks are just some ghosts, and Ferrola is not killing them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After another ten days, Mike and his new partner went to a new block to perform patrols. They stopped a bicycle that violated the traffic rules - just as they left the police car and wanted to ask, the person sitting in the back seat of the bicycle suddenly pulled out the gun and fired four shots at them. Mike's partner had a shot in his arm and abdomen. Mike was hit in the chest and died on the spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The murderer immediately fled into the alleys that were close at hand, and nothing was caught in the back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jessie thought that this was the end of the matter, and she received a timed encrypted email on the second day of Mike’s death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night falls, the coach opens the high pole light on the side of the field, strong The hot light will make the whole "barbeque rack" shine like white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Simulation confrontation training! Once again!" said the coach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The players made rumbling screams and continuous snoring in the wet, dark, sultry helmet... Their training time has exceeded For four hours, they are very tired. They have to rest! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coach is unmoved, "Only once," he said, "Okay, boys, run!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boys look at the captain. The captain was not easy to shake his head in a noticeable way. He was already in the 12th grade. He didn't want to violate the coach's meaning in such a small matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the boy who stood fifteen yards outside the line, which was Besib. Bissand - in the last height measurement, Besib is five feet and eleven inches. He is not the highest among the players. Weighing 180 pounds, not the heaviest - but the best - as the captain, he and the coach have done many personal tests for Besib. His best result is 4,000 pounds. The bench press is two hundred and thirty pounds and the vertical bounce is ninety-seven centimeters. The run-up bounce is 103 centimeters. The first two figures are close to professional weightlifters, and the latter two data are comparable to professional basketball players. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't think he has done his best." The coach said that the captain also thought so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coach wants to make Besib the new captain, and the captain is also aware of it - starting with the first training after school. The coach is constantly mobilizing the position of Besib... He let him be the center a few days ago, put him in the position of the defender in two days, and today he made a wide receiver - outsiders, he may not Can be sure to pay attention to how to use Besib, but people who know how to do it can be seen at a glance, the coach is preparing for Besib. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain caught the ball thrown by the center, made a fake action, and cast it far to Besib, the boy jumped up and caught it accurately. The ball that was a little bit taller. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coach is yelling when the ball is still in the air: "Run!" He waved his fist: "Run, Buffalo!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the official game, this practice is stupid, but in training, it is just a small test given by the coach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defensive team’s players swarmed and the offensive team members took a step slower. The defensive team’s cornerbacks successfully caught up with Besib, who was running in the touchdown area. The speed is excellent, the distance between him and Besib is rapidly shortening - this is what the coach wants to see - when there are fifteen feet from the touch line, the cornerbacks attacked - Besie Bu was dragged by him, although he was still struggling to move forward, according to the rules of the game, the attack has not failed, but more defensive team players are running. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishb was depressed and fell outside the line of touchdown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coach announced the offensive team score. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" The defender’s cornerback sullenly asked: "He only has one hand reaching into the touchdown area - his knees are still in the lineup. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Whether the touchdown is calculated according to the joints," the coach said, "Bishb's elbow pressed the touchdown line - note The children, in the official game, this situation has been determined to be scoreable." He hammered the kid's helmet: "So, never neglect, the distance between the enemy and victory is definitely better than you. I thought it was short!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised his right hand, scored a touchdown, and offensive and defensive exchange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened to your legs?" The captain noticed that Bisib’s posture was not right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s just a little numb." Besib said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Training is over, in the shower, Besib bends down to check his left leg, knees and calves are still a little red and swollen, and the ability to heal is almost as good as the sea This is not normal for a star versatile person - either he suddenly becomes an ordinary person, or that the injury is much more serious than he thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Hopkins checked him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Knee sprain, calf fracture." Dr. Hopkins said: "This is not a normal injury, you should stop training, go early Come back to rest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you let them know that I am a natural strength, responsiveness, and healing ability far better than their abilities," Besib Said: "The next thing will be a little troublesome." So he is never "injured." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who is that cornerback?" Sasha asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Avery. Famo." Besib said: "I thought he had nothing to do with us - is he still secretly in love with you?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little Hopkins swears awkwardly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let me come," Anthony Hopkins said. "What the little guy wants to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Avery’s roommate returned to the bedroom, Avery was taking a shower in the bathroom, he put The book was put back on the shelf, and when I sat on my bed, I smelled a stink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked for it and found that the smell came from a pair of pads under Avery’s bed, not like the insole, it should be used at the elbow, he Picking them up, they are heavy and hard, far beyond his imagination - he pinches the pads, which should be lined with something else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let it down." A voice suddenly said behind his back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
