Anthony Hopkins said calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind blows through the vast expanse of the gray desert, raising the dust that covers the sky, they are like the strong fog, rolling and rolling, hours The hours of the night are not seen, the orange and dark brown buildings are covered and surrounded by them, the outline is ambiguous, and only a very small piece is revealed only occasionally, but that piece is often very clear, like The beautiful little finger from the thick coat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rolling countryside is not at the end of the day, there are no artificial buildings around the city, not even a tree, a lake, or a gas station. This small city is like a small piece that is handcuffed by God. It is placed right in the middle of the desert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accident in Polyfimo caused the boys to accidentally out A week, Sasha and Besib are going to go back to Poseidon Island. They miss the craftsmanship of Old Andriana. Unfortunately, Anthony Hopkins brought back the news of Chegaler Bissand, he I hope that the boys will not go back for a while. This "temporary" may be three weeks or two months, but he guarantees that everyone can eat Halloween toffee apples on Poseidon Island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Hopkins took over the task of taking care of Besib, who originally suggested that they can go to Monte Carlo in Monaco, but whether it is Sasha And Besib is not very interested - except for the sea god island, they don't think much about the place near the sea in the near future - the water of the Poi-Puermo pot with thousands of bodies makes them fall for an appetite. Hopkins had to change his destination – a miniature world that also used gambling as the biggest economic pillar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Las Vegas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bessib looked at Anthony Hopkins with great interest, he knew that Chegaler had a lot of power and wealth. And there are a lot of friends, but now it seems that Big Hopkins is not too much. He made a phone call in a small hotel room that the rescue team had prepared for them (before Sasha took a lot of effort to get rid of his aunt), and the phone was only carried by him. When the inch-sized laptop was played, Besib noticed that he entered the password when he opened it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About two hours later (in these two hours, they took a shower, changed their clothes, and ate some hot dogs, Bessib and Sasha were hot milk, and Hopkins sipped a half cup of mint. Wine), a champagne-colored motorhome came to meet them. This car is very similar to the last Hopkins drive to the town of Grande, but the rear seats are much wider and they can be lowered. Putting them together into a big bed about eight feet wide, the two boys slept comfortably behind them, and what happened the night before was really enough for them. They slept very sweetly, and Dr. Hopkins gently woke them up. They still have a little bit of confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boys followed one of the underground cars and they found themselves in a small airport. The two drivers were waiting next to a silver commercial private jet. There are seven spacious and soft seats on the plane, and there is a small bar at the end, decorated with ivory white and tan. There are also two service staff. The plane took off immediately after they got on the plane. It circled a small circle in the air and flew inland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The children have already slept on the RV. However, Sasha fell asleep within a few minutes after boarding the plane. Anthony Hopkins refused the help of the service staff, wrapped himself in a blanket, and his pale golden head came over and leaned on him. On the shoulders. Besib can't afford to be spirited. He took the initiative to ask for a blanket and a brandy of cream and coffee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s just for the sake of the body. As a versatile person, their fatigue has long since been lifted. The tiredness they are showing now comes entirely from mental torture, especially in Sasha. He not only resists, but also tries to disturb him, although in the end he I gave up under the inspiration of Anthony Hopkins, but the energy spent on it was not so easy to find back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a new attempt, even Big Hopkins does not know what the final situation will look like, but the result is very satisfying to him - The sand passed down to the sister of Big Hopkins, and the other part of Sasha and his mother sometimes made him a little fragile and too gentle. Dr. Hopkins admitted that it was wonderful, but the world was in crisis, he Can't take risks, he must make Sasha Hopkins a "fresh" (the black words of the thugs: people who are difficult to deal with), Sasha must be equipped with fangs, claws and a hard and ruthless heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This process may be a bit painful, but he hopes that Sasha Hopkins does not have to repeat the same mistakes - Anthony Hopkins closes his eyes tightly, The door of the cellar opened, and he had no time to close it. The disgusting smell and the screams of the children’s fears rushed out. A girl was dragged out. She was only six years old, her skin was white and her hair was golden. There are tears in the deep blue eyes. She has been hungry for a while, but most of the fat accumulated in the rich and nutritious food of the previous six years is still intact. She is like a lame-like deer. Knocking forward, Hopkins shuddered all over, he resisted not sobbing, the strange airflow overflowed from the gap between his teeth, he smelled the scent, the scent of the broth, yes, he I also drank that broth and used his sister, the broth of Sasha's bones. The remnants used their remaining leftovers to feed the children who had not been selected to kill to keep the food fresh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hand covered the nose of Anthony Hopkins, his hands were hot, with the smell of oranges, and the cellar quickly went away. Hopkins opened his eyes and he found his tears in his eyes. Standing in front of him is a service staff. She is a young and beautiful woman. She is well-informed. She has seen many rude and arrogant guests. Some of them have killed people, and there are several who never beat women. Mixed balls, but no one of them can make her so fearful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins lowered his eyes, the service staff held a plate of steaming broth, next to the fresh lettuce, the salmon steak with ginger and garlic sauce . Juice and roasted browned bread, butter on the bread, the smell he just smelled came from here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He held down the hand, Sasha Hopkins's hand. The hand had temperature, and the blood flowed in the blood vessels. He pouted his lips and kissed him quietly on the palm of his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you," he said. "I am much better."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't matter." Sha said that he smiled at the service staff standing on the side and nodded: "Please change a bowl of creamy seafood soup," he blinked. "If you can, add some sweet basil inside." (Sweet basil has calm Role)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And absinthe." Dr. Hopkins added: "I think there should be here."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, we have everything here." The well-trained service staff finally recovered. She even attached a provocative smile, which was a little short. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The broth can be given to me." Besib, who was next to the seat, did not know when to stand up, his shoulders covered with a blanket. The hands are hidden underneath: "I am hungry and can only swallow a cow." The waiter with a red-brown wavy hair smiled gratefully at him, walked gracefully, bent down and placed the tray in his seat. On the front fixed table: "Thank you." She whispered, "My little good man."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distance between her lips and Besib’s ears when she talks Less than half an inch, her body temperature and aroma linger between the boy's skin and nose, and the slender hair is lifted by the breeze blown by the ventilation. Besib’s cheeks were scratched and itchy, and he shrugged his shoulders and returned to his seat, beginning to make a big leap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The service staff thought he was trying to get rid of her, but Besib knew that he was really hungry, and that he said that he could eat a cow is not an exaggeration - he was awakened by Big Hopkins. The threat and oppression made him sweaty - Sasha had done a power analysis for him, and he told Besib that his ability was inherited from the father of the power. This is normal, and his mother should not be a versatile person. Besib’s abilities are not mixed with things other than old mulberry, so in many cases, look at Chekal. Seeing him in the future... Sasha once mentioned it. Chegar's appetite is closely related to his ability, whether it is the growth of ability or change. It can be seen from his appetite, especially when he feels dangerous, he will eat more and digest faster - this has been confirmed by Besib, just now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great Hopkins made him feel hungry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the new soup came up, Anthony Hopkins first injected a low dose for himself (the service staff said yes, the plane really has everything ), then drank a half cup of absinthe, the cranial nerves finally stopped jumping, he turned the eye behind the closed eyelids, a little tears flowed out, and Shasha immediately wiped it off with his fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about medicine?" he asked with a serious look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not with you," Dr. Hopkins said. "But don't worry, I'm fine, it will be fine soon." He stretched out Arms, clinging to the shoulders of Sasha, turned his head and rubbed his lips with the soft blond hair of the child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib saw this scene, his face was slightly hot, like unintentionally revealing a friend's secret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The father and son on Poseidon Island are never so intimate, his nominal adoptive father is running around almost every day, and his real father, Chegal. Even more than Sangdi, even after each other’s identity is clear, he only hugged him a few times - such a close and tender embrace is often used as comfort (generally only on funerals) and rewards (if you really What are the things that are worthy of praise?) They are rare and precious. Adult males on Poseidon Island never give up their strength and banknotes, but they don’t know how to express their inner feelings. For them, this kind of behavior should only be Appeared on their mother, sister and daughter. A child, especially a boy, dares to casually make such a request to an older man. He will be treated as a sissy, and his father or brother will correct this "bad" by ridicule and whipping. "of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
