			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that the connection between Anthony Hopkins and his son relies on neither a mobile phone nor a so-called emergency contact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is something about the monastery, the doctor knows earlier than anyone, and more than anyone, when the word "locust" jumps into In his mind, he was already driving to the small village where the Boy Scouts used to gather and rest - he held the steering wheel for the second time in connection with Chegaler, Bissal, and Chegal. Bisangdi immediately called several of his powerful "friends", and friends immediately contacted several related personnel in the emergency affairs bureau. These related personnel are insignificant in terms of positions, but they have the ability to listen directly to the monks in the ancient courts of the East. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A short message layered with "top secret" was uploaded until it was placed on the desk that had been used by fifty-two presidents. This desk is not big, shiny, oak, wood comes from a retired naval ship two hundred years ago, and the presidents don’t know how many regulations, bills, bills and bulletins they signed on this table. A small note that is sent out can shake a small world - but the most talked about in the past 50 years is that a woman with a big mouth hides in it and sucks a second child of the president. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I thought this thing was over in 1950." One hand picked up the document, indeed, it looks like It's a trivial matter, but this little thing is like a locust. If you don't handle it well, it will cause endless troubles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Our is over," another voice said: "But the terrorists did not."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Are you sure that this thing is definitely not related to us?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Swear to God, absolutely no, those creepy studies and experiments in When we were a light butt child, we were stopped. All the researchers did not go into the cemetery or linger in the nursing home. Only those who are so mad will think of dig it out, but what is strange? They are not the first time to open Pandora's box."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am worried that the people will immediately put it and the town of Sami in 1950." When they are linked, they will be furious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then don't let them contact."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lie?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, we Just state the facts - don't go deep into the investigation. Don't think about it carefully - a group of boy scouts and monks, as well as the gangsters who want to kidnap them for ransom, have unfortunately encountered a landslide, their monastery is gone, and they die. Personal. It is worth mourning, let the helicopter and the nearby army and the army rescue, block the mountain, and move the nearby residents for at least four years - to avoid the villagers and those hunting, fishing, camping and hiking enthusiasts once again suffered from landslides. Threat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are also monks and boy scouts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The monks The accounts are not clean, they can't know anything about the things under the monastery. If they take the money, they will close their mouths tightly. The Boy Scouts' instructors are all strong Republican supporters..." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our people."<br /><br />& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, our people, we can invite their family to your farm holiday. The head of the Boy Scout is a retired Marine Corps. He knows how to maintain the honor of the country, he Protecting the children from being very seriously injured, almost died, I think, you can give him a medal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"President’s Medal of Freedom."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good. That's it. As for the Boy Scouts," the voice said a little sadly: "Dead a child."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Would you like me to send someone to attend his funeral?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, then it’s too exciting, people will doubt You only need to write a letter to his parents. But those injured children need condolences, we can contact Gregory, he has several big stars in his hand. Let them go to the hospital to visit, the children I will be happy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As far as I know, there are four more The son saw the institute with his own eyes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One of them is the son of the Boy Scout leader, you can see him at the ceremony, the other three ... no, two. Do you remember Anthony Hopkins? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I remember that my predecessor signed an amnesty for him. In fact he is a madman, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Sasha Hope Kings is his son, and his father and son are deeply emotional."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Another?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Bishb. Bisangdi. He is the son of Chekal. Bissand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The original source of this report seems to be Cheka Le Biszil."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And Anthony Hopkins, they have an emergency contact on their son."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ring hits the sound of the desktop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because the Sangdi family has been very docile in recent years." The increasingly hidden violent conflicts, the gradual collection of illegal businesses, and those through various The kind of roundabout means was sent to the large amount of political contributions in the hands of his campaign team,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So he immediately called our people, maybe because they didn't want to Let us think that they want to do something through this thing - in addition, Anthony Hopkins is under the protection of the Sangdi family, and their son is a very close friend."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, Sasha Hopkins and Besib. Bissau are no longer a problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"We will give a little discount to the Sangdi family, or lean."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't let our opponents and reporters catch their feet - Is there a fourth?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The fourth person is a little girl, called Lila, her parents died very early, and their brains have The fault is a power, her guardian is her uncle, working in the 'institution'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is that 'institution'?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's that 'institution', she has two uncles, one of them has a good good position... I seem to have forgotten to mention, Sasha Hopkins And Besib. Bissand, and their parents are not ordinary people, 'the organization has their files.'<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So these children can escape from a group of heavily armed mercenaries? - I thought they met the real "McCurry? Calkin" (the star of the devil's head). Then say The 'institution' side also needs to give some benefits?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ring hits the sound of the desktop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We don't have to give anything," the voice said. "Gci and 'institutions' have been entangled for a long time, and they are not able to find a place to go. 'Institutions' will never find their way to death at this time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I support gci, those who are more dangerous than criminals with guns - - What else do I need to know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Baoer. Douglas, a child, is a side branch of the Douglas family, but he failed to enter the basement. Not knowing much, we will inform his parents to keep him quiet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ring hits the sound of the desktop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...What about locusts?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Emergency Affairs Bureau, Health Bureau and Safety The committee will pay attention to it, they can use a mixture of agents. Radiation and chemical sterilants, they also got some parasitic wasps, which will be parasitic in the nymphs of the locusts, and when they grow up, the nymphs will die. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have to stare at them, this thing needs to be done right away. - In addition, let the Health Department authorize the release of health knowledge about locust bites and Anti-mite warning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now it is the locust In the seasons, and two children have been bitten by mites, and only one-third of the entire federation has no mites - I know what you are worried about, but I am sitting here. It is necessary to protect each one. The right to life and health of federal citizens is not infringed, whether it is an ability, a gun, or a locust."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I thought I was dead this time," said the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are a strong hero." The nurse who came to change the drug for him smiled and touched his forehead with his little finger. There was a twilight scratch there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the team knew that he was in an extremely dangerous situation, but he was not sure how dangerous it was - when he was sent, the doctor even tested Less than his blood pressure, his heartbeat was slow and almost no, there was a spot on the skin, and the blood that was lost at one time, in the next operation, he continuously gave blood that was nearly three times the blood volume of the whole body. The heartbeat and breathing have temporarily stopped more than once, and the doctors are wondering why he can stick to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes that have been dug up are not regenerable, but the doctors have tried their best to keep the other eye, and the surviving eyes can finally open today. The head of the group looked back at him, twisting the unusually beautiful hips. Whistling in a whisper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His injured leg was cut off, but the Boy Scouts’ donation and rewards are enough to guarantee his and his son’s future life, a medical device supplier willing Give him free prosthetics for the next 30 years - legs, as well as eyes, legs with prostheses are the latest. High-performance carbon fiber composite material, which looks like two uppercase cs, can mimic the reaction of healthy human feet and ankles, store and release energy, and he can walk and run quickly after wearing it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door of the ward was pushed open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the doctor officially announced that he was out of danger, many people took turns to look at him (after getting the doctor and his permission), only he was here. Son Charlie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie applied to the school for a temporary suspension of study. Besib helped him borrow an apartment in Lafayette. He taught himself in the apartment for the 11th grade. See him once a day in the morning and afternoon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey." The boy said, came over and grabbed his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"嗨." The head said, in turn, holding the child's hand, his palm was significantly thinner and the skin slipped over the bone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I baked you a small cake." The boy said that he put the biscuits on a small table on one side and dragged the chair to sit beside the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Does chocolate with hazelnuts?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, plus blueberry sauce."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Then come and give me two." The head said: "I thought that the food in the big hospital would not be as bad as a fast food restaurant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Charlie brought him the cake, and also took a glass of water, adjusting the straw so that his father didn't have to turn his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The single room is very quiet, and the voice of the head chewing and licking and drinking can be heard clearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He ate all the little cakes, and Charlie was glad that he had burnt a large portion of the cake, only a few left to barely see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Charlie," the head said: "How about I transfer to you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie A little surprised, his father wanted to transfer him when he opened his gay identity, but he didn't want to continue to cover up. Even if he changed a school, he was a gay man who came out of the house. The right thing is still the same, he does not feel that he needs to change school. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His refusal made his father feel very annoyed and never mentioned it again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Would you send me to see a psychiatrist?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I am willing to transfer," Charlie pinched the paper bag with the cake and said, "In the new school, if someone asks, I will not hide my sexuality-" He hesitated for a moment: "But I won't yell at everyone again. I am a homosexual - I am sorry, Dad," he said frankly. "I thought it was handsome. In fact, it only makes me like a Big fools and masochists."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No one will find you in trouble anymore," said the head. "You will go to Grande." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie suddenly widened his eyes and the cake bag turned into a ball in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is the church school!" he screamed in a low voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as you don't naked or harass the professor inside," the head said happily: "No, just don't harass the professor - Hopkins and me." Talked about it, there are some well-educated and polite children. Yes, they may not be jealous of you, but they will not spit on you, insult, and beat you, and their facilities and teachers also It’s better than your original school.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Tuition...” Charlie reminded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Douglas is willing to pay for all the expenses, tuition, accommodation, food, and community in Grande for the next three years, in order to thank me for saving his son. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you are for..." Save me, after his escape, his classmates have told him about what happened after he left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about that," the head said indifferently. "It is an indisputable fact that he returned to the barn."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Baoer. Douglas must be mad," said Charlie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And his father." The head of the group smiled painfully and slyly, if Bo's father was a true good-natured, generous He may remain silent, but when he knows that Boa. Douglas's father is trying to sue the Boy Scouts and him - because their activities have put his son in danger, he has no worries. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foguez Douglas is a hypocritical and greedy person, but when it comes to the Boy Scout organization and politics, he is just a poor little locust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sasha and Besib will be your friends," said the head. "But please don't date them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are as straight as a laser," Charlie said. "But can I date other people? - Not a girl."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the team was silent for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned his head to look at his son, leaving only one eye to make him very unaccustomed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
