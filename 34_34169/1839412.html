Bisangdi?" asked Dr. Hopkins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only Besib."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about the people coming?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bep slightly reveals a strange expression because he doesn’t know how Hopkins knows this, "Amp and Pepi." They followed The plane came, and then left without going back, because the old Andriana asked them to "here the hearts of the children". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins squeezed the cold fingertip and put it back under the sheets, then he said the names of several people, "These Didn't people?” These names belong to the young people on the island of Poseidon, where they work, laundry, hotels and restaurants, etc. They are the ones arranged by Chekal Bissand to their sons. They should follow Beishi. Bu, at least some of them should be. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That said, only Besib was a man who went back." The doctor said that his voice and expression were accompanied by an unpredictable taste. Beppe stood upright. He was a "dirty work" person, but he still felt the itchiness of the back could not stand, and the sweat soaked his shirt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes," he said. While looking at the people on the bed, people on Poseidon Island used to see the injured person and the body, but the face of Sasha Hopkins was indeed paler than any living person he had seen before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hop Hopkins stood up from the chair, he took a step forward, less than three feet from Beppe, and Beppe immediately stepped back two step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What have you been doing before?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What have you been doing before, do it now." The doctor said with a sigh of relief, "I don't need you here."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bep is neither an idiot nor a bad head or a lot of alcohol. He is keenly aware of something wrong, and the young man is uneasy and anxiously moved, but In Manchester, they have to listen to Hopkins in the absence of Sandy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he does -- there is nothing to do, more accurately, can't do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking down from the window. I can see that Beppe is out of the shadow of the building. The silver characters on the jacket shone in the moonlight, and Anthony Hopkins checked the situation of Sasha for the fifth time - the physical damage should have been healed, and the mental anesthesia had to wait for a while. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doctor stepped out of the room and turned a corner. Walk straight down the long corridor. for him. Every structure of the hospital can be said to be similar. He has more than once skilled and easy to find the gadgets he needs - and like every time, he is like going into his kitchen and taking out a book. The recipe did not know why the vacant room that had become extraordinarily empty took a sealed blood collection device. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So. What do you want me to do?" Chiz said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine looked at her and seemed very unbelievable: "What do I want you to do? What can you do?" She touched the lighter with her thumb The embossing on the top: "If you really want to say something, then stay away from me - no matter how slight the impact you bring, you can't stay in the public toilet all day because you have no taste." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Real?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chiz Carson said, I don’t know when she was amber The color of the eyes is no longer a physiological tear but a disgusting arrogance: "Do you really want me to give up Sasha Hopkins?" She whispered: "So you prepare Who will take over? A little guy who is fortunate enough to be recognized by Sangdi? Silent, meek, blood, mourning and death are as commonplace as the pots and shovel in the kitchen. Their grandfather is a criminal, father. It’s a criminal, a brother is a criminal, and the future husband and son will eventually be criminals, they will be ecstatic, no matter What is said, 'The judge of the blonde' is a true and outstanding person on the island of Poseidon. He is the closest friend of Sangdi. He is almost his brother. He is very sultry, has no evil, and commits crimes. Even the most difficult to deal with 'Iron Taro' can hear his name and can't help but soften his legs - their mother will be proud of having such a son-in-law.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, as an actor, his name will be the same as that of Anthony Hopkins on the headline of the institution you worked for.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you have this picture in your fantasy? It doesn't matter, you can think about it now, how do you feel? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The older woman took out another cigarette, and she tried her best, but she immediately tasted the bitter taste of the bitten filter and tobacco. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But I am different. I am Carson and Douglas. I am a victim. I hate criminals. For more than a decade, I have been Living in a stable and safe environment, though... I have to get rid of the part of Poseidon Island, I love him, love is mad, all I need now is an opportunity - I want to marry him, he will have a The respected identity of others, a noble and affluent position, a safe and warm place, two are more children, and some friends, you know what I mean, Catherine, and Besib. The same friend, no one can threaten him - even if only 20 years, or only 10 years ... we will succeed, those you are worried about, whether it is Anthony Hopkins or Besib Sangdi, can't affect him anymore... at least, can't Now, almost entirely in control of all his. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't," Catherine said. "Is it?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can't do it now." "Qiz pointed sharply: "And your nephew is about to become a competent criminal. And..." She licked her lips, one of the most hated actions of her mother. She always thought that it would be a prostitute or a mental retardation, or both: "You have spent so much on me. Time, is it just because of boredom? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I need you, you need me too," she continued. "There are no better candidates than me. You know this very well." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Anthony Hopkins has proved that he is innocent. As far as I know, someone is open arms to welcome his return. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sasha Hopkins? "The doctor said: "The doctor is respected, but it is only for ordinary people. Here, doctors, lawyers or others, people without surnames will only become tools and decorations, they can't enter this." Circles - Why is Anthony Hopkins accepted and loved? Because he has a surname, a coat of arms and a historical surname, so he can be trusted, or else you think that those people will be naive to say something to another stranger who doesn’t know the roots - in a shit Can also sell the big price on the premise - as long as the pile of shit can catch up with them? She said, don't fight a little bit: "They don't dare to rush to deliver their secrets to a small person born in an apartment. Even if he holds a certificate in his hand, it is useless. They only believe in the flow inside the body." The blue-blooded man, Anthony Hopkins, is one of them. He has a pedigree that can be queried, a pitiful life experience, far more than ordinary people's mind and appearance, and high and eccentric ambiguity. He is recognized and The time of appreciation is astonishingly short, and there are still hundreds of people who appreciate him a lot – I am not talking about housewives who are excited and screaming at the vampires and serial murders on the TV set. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
