			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 155th chapter Polyfimo (10)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory The last stage for the Xiqiao was round and about 50 feet in diameter. As we have previously depicted, it is separated from the nearest auditorium by a wide waterway with the plane of the waterway at the knees of the audience. The location, the water inside is crystal clear, and the clusters of gray shadows are like the glimmer of the corners of the eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is that?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pikefish. There are also some small warm water sharks. Gregory said: "In order to increase the number of gimmicks," he stared at the surface of the water, a gray shark caught up with a barracuda of only half the size, it bit the lower part of it, the pike frantically Struggling, rebelling, the shark was bitten by it, other pike and shark smelled bloody, they gathered around, gathered and attacked, tore them into pieces, the eater and the eaten did not After a few minutes, the fish was swallowed up and the fish swam away. The pool water became a bit muddy before the deep red blood and milky white tissue settled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib overlooks the water, a four-foot-long pike has an interest in his shadow, hidden in warm water, with that pair The black round eyes looked at the creatures on the water, and some of the smaller companions swam around it, and the ten lips that covered the upper lip were slightly open. They don't look fierce or even harmless, but the son of the sea god island thug leader is well aware that this fish with the name "Sea Wolf" is actually one of the most brutal marine carnivorous fish, its cruelty. It is almost comparable to sharks, and it is violent, vicious, and elusive. People who swim in the sea often encounter this fish. They will be lazy at first, as if they are not interested in you. But if you bleed or show timidity, they will immediately come up - the fishermen of Poseidon Island never catch them, because the meat of this fish can eat, but grow and inhabit the area of ​​Poseidon. The body of the pike contains a large amount of coral reef fish toxins. This toxin does not harm fish, but it can work in human body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The audience entered the scene one after another. Because the location of the concert was too special, they had to gather on the coast first, then take a large yacht to the wave before the show started. Lu Feimo. The VIP seats can also get three days and two nights of accommodation tickets, which is also the reason why the ticket price can reach up to 10,000 yuan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's wrong, son?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I saw my classmates." Boa. Noel Douglas said coldly. "Are you sure this is a VIP seat?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since his parents can afford the tuition of Grande, there is still no problem with a ticket in the district. Mrs. Douglas said that she sat down gracefully and blocked the underside of her knee with a fine cashmere scarf, lest it be invaded by the cold wind blowing from both sides of the seat. "Sit down, child, you can chat with your classmates after the show."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baoer sneered, he didn’t think he and one unknown There is something worth talking about between the wild children of identity. They will only try to kill each other when they meet - if they can be irresponsible. He sat down on the chair and put one leg on the other leg. His toes were against transparent glass about three feet high, and a small shark with a gray-black back was tempted to jump out of the water. The nose slammed into the glass, and the boy burst into laughter as it touched the ground and fell back into the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Convergence point," said Fergus Douglas, the seat of the VIP seat is very spacious. But it was a little small for him, and he wrinkled his thick eyebrows. Staring at the fish: "It’s all fancy stuff, and Xiqiao doesn’t need it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Douglas made a sharp laugh: "You really know her very well, how? Does her economic man have arranged for you a candlelight date worth repeating?" She did not hide her contempt: "Not much money, dear, he Only 10 million insured, you can get it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Enough." Ferguson Douglas whispered angrily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition," Boa flipped his hand into a catalogue of tickets and tracks, with a photo of Xiqiao on the cover. I have always had a question, you said, dear mother, 'have chest and hips'? But can I not find out? Or will she suddenly grow on the stage?"<br /><br />&nbsp Mrs. Douglas quickly glanced at the color page in her hand. "Oh, baby, don't care too much about it," she said briskly. "That's just a metaphor. She is a bit different - I It is said that she is a little thinner than those of his former wife, but she is at least small enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought you know, Boa," said Mr. Douglas. "What your mother loves most is to open the mouth. It even surpasses gems and fashion... Well, stop here. I will take you not to let you ignite. And, you, Mrs. Douglas." He aggravated the pronunciation of Mrs. Douglas and satisfactorily saw that the stupid woman finally settled down - they were divorced when Boa was very young, but It didn't prevent her from squatting on him. The property she split at that time was almost one-tenth of the Douglas family. He had to give her a small amount of alimony every month, and, Before she remarried, she still had the right to affix her name to Douglas's surname, so she could still continue to wander in the original circle without worrying about being expelled. Of course, she can also recover. Her original surname, but the class that it can represent has fallen, she will not think again to go back and mix with those who have a false name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other spectators are also present, some of them dyed their hair and eyebrows in silvery white, and some painted grayish-white paint on bare skin, not to mention Those guys who wrap their whole body with this white bandage... In short, everyone can find white. The proponents of Xiqiao express their love and support for Xiqiao in this way. Douglas thinks this is a bit redundant. But they also had to succumb to the big environment, they took a fairly conservative approach - Ferguson Douglas smashed a white handkerchief in his top pocket, Mrs. Douglas's jewelry was white opal, and Boa was a On the white bow tie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baoer is boring and yawning, and the occasional killing and slaughter in the waterway can no longer attract his interest. He holds it with one palm. Head, up and down the scanning venue to all pass the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light is suddenly darkened, and then the light of one color of the milk is wrapped in the mist made of dry ice and throws straight from the top of the circular stage, just like a life. The curtain blocked the entire stage, they piled up on the edge of the stage, and after rolling, they became lighter, thinner and scattered into the waterway - replacing them with a dark brown plucked piano, a performer, and six A singer. The singer wore a long black dress with sleeves covering the back of the hand. The skirts buried their feet. Their hair was also dyed black, and the face was pale. They did not deliberately bulge their eyes and lips. It looked like six pieces of activity. The vocal set, three on the right side of the plucked piano, three on the left side of the plucked piano, the piano player is between the boy and the teenager, his face can not be summarized into a strong and vivid line. However, he was not deliberately neglected. His makeup artist was skillful. His face was covered with a layer of metallic yarn. The light quickly moved away. The time was only a few seconds, but Boa still recognized Out of him, the kind of hair color like moonlight is rare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ferguson Douglas also recognized: "What did I say?" He yelled: "Is it really wrong, now Grande students need to earn their own tuition?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This mixed ball!" Boa suddenly became furious. "Is Mr. Chennike! I know what they are doing?" He opened the introduction in angrily, the light was too dark. He had to squint to see the words above: "This is a charity show! All the income will be donated to Greenpeace - so Mr. Chennike will let him... let Sasha Hope Kings appeared here! Really damn!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's the matter," his mother casually clicked on the stage, the music had already started, and the chorus began to sing softly and dance. The actor didn't know where to drill out. Their tights were translucent, white, shiny, and tight like a second layer of skin. Their movements were very slow, but the muscles were very tight, they made each An incredible posture, like Seeing every part of their body, Mrs. Douglas was fascinated, her tongue squirming in her mouth, and screaming at the captain. "What happened to that child?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Extracurricular activities and volunteer points," Boa fell back into the chair, the wood has become a boat, and nothing has been done, he swayed his fingers: "How much income can this show? Ten million? Two Tens, or 50 million? As long as three hours, Sasha Hopkins can get the extracurricular activities and volunteer points for the entire school year. This is unfair and unfair!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will try to get the teacher to arrange this opportunity for you too." Mrs. Douglas said with diligence: "How about a charity competition?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"How much can you get? Mother?" Boa stunned the woman who gave birth to him. He knew that once he promised, his mother would raise the banner and raise money everywhere, and then Take out one percent or less to complete the sale: Save the province, you still have so many people to raise - how is the painter? He is waiting for you to open a painting exhibition for him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I will arrange this for you, so you will give me a shut up immediately.” Fergus Douglas interrupted their words impatiently, and he sprayed his nose at Boa: "Of course, if you are really Not reconciled, son, I can lift you up and throw it into the waterway. You can swim with the pike to compare with Hopkins. How about?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
