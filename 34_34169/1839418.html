			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knocking of the door is always out of place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Lor immediately recalled how high the volume of his speech was, and whether it would lead to information that is not suitable for third parties to cross through the two doors. And a living room passed to the ears of this uninvited guest - the conclusion is that unless the guy has a pair of rabbits or cat ears. That may not matter, what is important is who is standing outside the door? It’s seven o'clock in the evening, and most people are in the restaurant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He almost sighed and walked over to open the door, standing at the door with a tall, strong and thick guy who looked like a rugby player, oh no. He is a rugby player and Mr. Lor has seen him on the court. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Avery?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avery, his eyes are in the room two The individual turned around and Mr. Lor also looked at him. He couldn’t see anything from the slow and heavy face. “Can I be advanced?” he said, then screamed The plastic bag entered the room. The plastic bag was thick, white, stained with dirt, and was wiped with a damp rag. It left a light gray print on it, and the big one could hold two or three-year-old children. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope I didn't bother you," Avery said, depending on Mr. Lor's obvious volatility. The attitude is like nothing: "This is my mother to send you." , a gift," he opened the plastic bag to Brian, a sweet fragrance instantly invaded the nose of three people, a whole rose was packed in a plastic bag, exuberant and dense, with A big black mud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Flower?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Heavy white rose, variant." Avery said: "We have been thinking about what to give you, Mr. DuPont, but we have no money, and you are very rich. Since you saved my mother's life, we don't want to casually... I mean, one A cake or a notebook is obviously not suitable, I think you might like this - it is beautiful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Lor looked at Brian a little uneasy But Avery didn't reveal the traces of what he knew from beginning to end. He told them a few clumsy jokes. Some things about the football team. After drinking two cups of steaming black tea, he got up and took a goose down pillow and got up and said goodbye, so when he was about to leave the room. When I suddenly throw a problem. None of them could react. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is there a bull on her chest?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brian and Lor have not responded. But they are all trained after all (so that they can blurt out the troubles when they have to face the media), they are very close to their mouths, the problem is that they have no way to control themselves for the time being. The tongue controls the expression of his own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Lor hasn’t figured out what happened in the first few seconds. His body vacated and slammed into the wall decorated with small paintings. The picture frame broke. Fortunately, the nail behind the drawing board pierced a thin pulp board and paper into his back instead of the skull, but he The head still had a sweet and deep kiss with the hard wall. For a moment, he could feel the brain wrapped in the membrane swaying like a pudding in a silver bowl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nail cut open the muscles and skin, he didn't feel too painful, he saw Avery grabbing Brian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s awful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is beating Brian, and Brian has no resistance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Lor had to scream, and when he found that Avery was trying to kill Brian, his fingers flustered in his clothes looking for movement. The phone, but the finger is not obedient, he must be ridiculous when he is full of mouth and sticky and wet, and he hates vomiting, vomiting makes him feel sick, and then he will spit more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, even if he found the phone, it was not very useful, no matter what the guards or anything else, they had no time to save Brian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Think about your mother!" Lol finally shouted like this: "And your father! You yourself!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming with him is Avery. Famo is full of anger and hatred. His words are confusing and ambiguous. The recurring name is a woman’s name, it seems to be her. A young woman who was unfortunately killed by Brian at a small party, Lor remembers that her name is related to flowers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous words seemed to have a role, Brian was still squatting, but he was still alive, and then things got transferred in the next moment, the branch was taken The rose from the gift suddenly grows wildly, like a freeze-frame photography that compresses a few seconds into a few seconds. Green leaves and white flowers cover Brian and Avery in the blink of an eye. Then, the plants receded in a tidal wave, revealing the unlucky Brian, and Avery, who was tightly entangled in a thorn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Would you like to call the hospital?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"50074455." Lor said that it is his private hospital, the facilities are complete, the key is that the security measures are completely . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Police?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Temporarily not," said Lor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baoer. Douglas came in and closed the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is this guy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A madman." Lorne at Brian By the side, Brian's throat was swollen quickly, and Boa checked his condition, smashing a few leaves from his pocket and smashing it into Brian's mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The swelling subsided at a speed visible to the naked eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you so much." Lol touched Brian's neck, his sister Miss Lor is Brian's fiancee, and she loves it. He, rarely, is sincere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is enough to be deliberately murdered." Boa said: "He will stay in prison for twenty years, no parole for fifteen years. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This bitch killed my sister!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You took it Money!" Lol said (this time he remembers to lower his voice), he knows that it is best not to say anything now, but obviously a person's silence is useless: "You have already taken the money!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Money?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One...Agreement," Lor did not want to answer Douglas' question at first, but In the end, he shrugged his shoulders exhaustedly. His back was very painful and his head was dizzy. And the sour smell in his mouth and body made him want to vomit for the third time - anyway, this thing can only be said to be a little secret in their circle: "It is just an accident, you know, we, people, to avoid Trouble, so I used a little trick - we gave the money, and then they accepted it. I don't know how this guy will suddenly go crazy - don't he know how he came in? Ten million, plus one Manchester admissions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shit," Avery said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hospital ambulance arrived soon, and the students were told that the admin’s dormitory was caused by a water heater explosion that caused three people to be injured. Avery was anesthetized. Lift the ambulance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avery's reaction caught the attention of the DuPont family and the Lor family. The guy responsible for handling this matter was called back urgently. Yes, Flora Famo's agent, the big-mouthed little star, and Flora's police fiancé are their masterpieces, but beyond conventional means. Flora’s family had no more evidence to prove that Flora’s death had nothing to do with those damn little punks. They didn't even know that the case involved the DuPont family. They are as ignorant as any other people. With a little means, they can have nothing. It is not impossible to let them disappear directly. But Brian Dupont could not afford more psychological pressure, so a lawyer came out in the name of the Flora economic man and asked the family to remain silent (of course, he borrowed the name to guarantee the reputation of the economic company), he Brought a 10 million compensation, Manchester's admission is the family's own proposed, without much discretion, the responsible person agreed to this request. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the message they got from Avery was that they had never seen a hybrid lawyer and had not taken any money. Avery’s admission was Thanks to another person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nine true and false, it is clear that someone has skillfully exploited the loophole between the DuPont family and the service providers. The DuPont family believes that this matter is gone, the wound It has healed and can be forgotten, but in fact, the wound is burning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people on Poseidon Island only got after 72 hours Detailed information about this matter can be attributed to the strict monitoring of the "eyes" of the affairs of Sasha Hopkins and Besib Bissan (they have not yet withdrawn) and those rare Weird abilities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A year is the election," said Chegal Bissham: "DuPont is one of the most popular candidates."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If Avery. Famo didn't know until then that Brian was the man and suddenly broke out," said Bisan. "They won't let this stupid guy." Rushing up to kill, they will let him appear in front of the public and the media as an innocent survivor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There will be more evidence and direct points to the entire DuPont family." The doctor pointed his finger: "If it weren't for such a small accident, this little trick would probably succeed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The behemoth is always difficult to pay attention to under the feet." Coughing a few times than Sangdi, "Give me a glass of rum," he said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doctor stood up and brought him a steaming, rum with cloves, cinnamon, nutmeg, butter, brown sugar and salt. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How many rums are there, 50 ml?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"5 ml." Doctor Say: "Your body can only bear so much this day, every day."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you think that adding 'everyday' can make me feel comfortable If you are wrong, then it’s a big mistake,” Chegal said impatiently. “How long will this situation last?” He held the cup, and there was a slight shackle in the cup, his hand shaking very badly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a person who saw Chekal Bissau three months ago came in, he would be very confused because he was in this room I can't find the thug leader in that memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Celegal. Bisangdi is still alive, but he is old, old is very powerful, the fat that once covered a whole room is gone, The thin muscles of the paper are close to the thin bones, and the skin is covered with a layer of dust that is blown away. He loses his hair, leaving only twenty teeth, and his eyes are murky. The words are slow and soft, just like being in a nightmare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I seem to be a hundred years old," Chekal. Bissand commented. "This is a rare thing on Poseidon Island. It is worth buying tickets." Take a look."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The remaining part of your body will help you recover," Dr. Hopkins said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But it is impossible to return to the original state?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not already Did you give it to Besib?" Dr. Hopkins said, "Don't tell me you regret it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Exactly," the former thug leader snorted: "I have already regretted it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Hopkins didn't say anything more. He turned his head and looked out the door, erecting his index finger and pressing it on his lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah," Chegal said: "The kid is coming."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"True I am glad that your hearing has not been affected."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, I can keep my ears, full set."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Chegal said this sentence, the dark-skinned young man had come in, and he immediately shrank it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don’t do anything for you." Chegaler said harshly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s hard, Anthony Hopkins said in his heart, although he really never felt embarrassed because he had done anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishb went to the rocking chair and kneeled down on one knee. Then kissed and kissed Chegal's hand. The old man's skin is dry and slippery - the latter adjective is directed at its relationship to the bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sit down." Chegal said: "I have something to say to Dr. Hopkins."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Opposite Cecal, Dr. Hopkins has an empty chair on the right hand side, the door to the terrace is open, and the sky and ocean outside is golden. Reflecting human hair and forehead. The sea breeze passes through the room. Spin between the furniture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib’s father, the former “Tang”, the leader of Masoye swayed slightly in the rocking chair. "I am leaving, Besib," he said quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boy, no, now we should call him a man. After all, he is already the leader of nearly 100,000 thugs and their affiliates. Rubbed your eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leave you, leave Poseidon Island, and leave Masoyer." Chegal said: "Leave my first 50 years - I don't want to let you , including you know where I am going, except for Anthony Hopkins, because maybe I will need him to save my life if necessary - and I want to tell you because I don't want you to think that I was killed by a friend. He yelled at Anthony: "It's still your friend's father... Yes, then he has to do something very dangerous. He will delete and modify my memory, my dear Besib, I will be a normal People, a middle-aged person who is not too young, but still has some money, is not married, has no children, lives on funds and professional investors, has real estate in many places, but recently wanted to find a warm and dry place to settle, maybe I will marry a wife, give birth to a child, just like this... For fifty years, it’s like a plain, ubiquitous, colorful publication, which may have a million words, which can be opened first. The page makes people have no desire to read, even if It is in the toilet and on the plane."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You might wonder why I did this," Chegaler gently looked at Besib, his child grew up, healthy and beautiful, enough to temper his eyes in recent months. There are knives and poisons in the possession. "The old guys are running out, right, naughty, I know what you do," he didn't accidentally see Besib once again revealing that he didn't like to watch. Expression: "There is no one who needs me to suppress and appease, son, and young people like you, worship you, then you only need a suitable marriage, let your bride's father and brother support you, as a father. I will preside over the wedding for you, then I will be able to go to the 'no sang' day, yes, no more than mulberry, no Chegal, only an old immigrant, like the hundreds of millions of law-abiding citizens in the West. Anan divides his days.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you want me to stay? What makes your mind confused? There is no one in a wolf group. Both heads of the wolf, and you still ate my flesh - take away My strength, my youth, my status, where do you think that I will not hate you? In every night of silence, I cough, back pain, sleepless, no one respectfully Show me, respect me, look to me, pray for protection, I can't love you any more. And you know, I am capable and some people can do something through my name, I love Poseidon Island, and Masaoye. I don't want to turn it into a mess of garbage. I will give you the unsuccessful business. I hope that you can continue to do it, do it well, and achieve my goal. Rather than letting all my efforts in the past few decades become a bubble, that's why I endure patience and concession at the last minute – not just because of loving you, my son. I love you, but that can't fear with death. If you are only because I am your father, you are my son, I will eat you, even if I can only live for a few more years, I will.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;So, no need to worry, your survival is not me Gifts, but transactions.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am alive now. Not ready to commit suicide. But Chegaler than Sangdi is already a hindrance rather than a boost, when you marry Later, maybe, I will want to see my grandson. But at the latest. After that, Anthony Hopkins will make me a brand new person.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;You can mourn, it doesn't matter, but you will know. Your old father is living in a sunny, beautiful town, and his next life is very different from any 'Tang'. He is a lucky guy, he gave up a lot, but he has 'self.' Yes, that's it, a Tom, or a Jack."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about me? What about me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't need to remember you, because remembering you said that I am still Chegar. Bisand, I will It is your biggest threat - you have Sasha, Pei Pei, and priests, as well as amps, bep, many, many people, they will support you, of course, if you think you can, you can also Ask Anthony Hopkins for help, not only his brother's father, but also my friend."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishb. When Bessandi walked out of the room, she felt more frail and unreal than ever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chegal. Bissan said yes, it’s all right, he is, Besib is like a boat standing up. Two elephants, the Poseidon Island people are uneasy about this. Beppe heard a lot of winds. Although some of the old people expressed loyalty to him, they will still be tempted for a while from time to time. They will even avoid cutting out of Chegal. Than the mulberry, because this will not only make them feel ashamed, but also make them suffer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Celegal. Bisangdi used to be their king, brave and intelligent, omnipotent, they support him, he bless them, willing to give life to each other and Soul; but when he was unable to fulfill his obligations, they immediately abandoned him without hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the half as a mob, I think this is justified, but the half as human beings is hard to let go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib is also. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has thanked God many times that he did not really eat up his father, but he ruined Chegal. Bisangdi is an indisputable fact, even According to Anthony Hopkins, his swallowing just stopped the almost unrestricted hunger and the near collapse of the Chegal body, a weak, useless, full of drugs and The second half of the TV will not belong to a sangdi, but it is better to give him a bullet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if it is the latter, Besib will feel the tingling and fear uncontrollably, he will tremble and can’t help but want to growl and cry. He kissed his father's hand, it was warm, and Chegal's face and body were deformed, but he was still there, in the room, he could open the door and see it instead of...<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib has participated in many funerals, but it is all of others, others, others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay," said Chegal, satisfied, he took it. I took my thigh and found that the palm of my hand was caught by the bones on my leg: "My son solved it, what about you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? ?? The doctor said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your son, Anthony." Chegal said: "Although Besib is soft, it doesn't matter, I think he can still make the right choice." The question is your son, our little golden hair, Sasha? You also said that you want him to taste the blood of Besib - but now, I am afraid there is no suitable person here - what should I do? The knife that has never seen blood can only pruning the apple. If it is, I can't bear it, and I don't dare to let him stay with Besib. Oh, don't mention your little trick, that can only be used to lie. Defrauding laymen - killing people and people who haven't killed people are always two extremes. It's two different things to mess with other people's brains and open other people's chests. You really want your son to continue. Staying in the world of Bambi?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My son will not be the leader of 100,000 thugs," the doctor said indifferently: "What does he want?" Just how."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "God, this is too capricious." Chekal Bissan said: "What about Besib?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib is very important, but it is absolutely important to me - Hope Kings Dad thought with pride, but he knew what Chegard really wanted to hear: "I promise I will look at them, every moment. Sasha. And Besib."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is enough, and Chegara sighed sadly, picking up the cup rather than adding rum to the milk than adding rum The milk, it has become warm, and the mouth is light and tasteless and cold, just like his future life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time of year is sometimes short and horrifying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened in Manchester, I mean, there are few people who care about DuPont, and there is no death after all. Among the three people who were caught by the "water heater explosion." Mr. Lor’s injury was the lightest. He returned to class after only one day of rest, but he could not exercise vigorously; and Brian Dupont stayed in the hospital for two months (he didn’t need to stay that long, only his family thought He is better off not going back to school until some things are gone. Avery. He is a hopeful boy. But it is not irreplaceable. This "handling" was extra cautious, and Brian was not saying anything, anyway. The trouble of the last time was brought about by his extra compassion - so the car accident that ruined the lives of a family happened more than a year later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Brian came back to sort things out, he found that not only Besib, Bissand and Sasha Hopkins, but also a few people also proposed to take a break from school. One of the more notable names is Chiz Carson. She also proposed to suspend school for two years, and this thing does not seem to be simple, because she disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A rumor." Miss Lor frowned and said: "It is said that someone saw Chiz outside the three regions, and she had a big belly. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hopkins?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who knows?" Miss Lor said: "In any case, I think she wants to give birth to this child."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A child?" The young "Tang" almost jumped out of the chair: "A baby? My brother?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Should be right," Pei Pi said: "The girl gave him a child."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Qiz Carson."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's impossible." If there is a "Chez Carson eviction agent," Sasha will hoard a few dozen Put it in your own room and in the car - and the brothers of Besib are almost a bit clean in this respect, according to Besib, he is the biggest Intimate act probably only to the extent that touch the lips (no tongue!) Of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's more, it's still Chiz Carson. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In any case," Besib murmured: "If this is true, then this is still a good news." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe they all drank more wine," Pepi said, although he knew that Hopkins was different, don’t say wine, many drugs are coming to them. It is said that the effect is average, but it is also possible that he is only interested in sleeping with the girl for one night. This is nothing, even if the girl is not good, it doesn't matter, when the man always has impulsiveness, the Poseidon Island does not hit the woman, but There are also a few people living in their hands who want to steal evidence or commit murder. "But the child seems to be a little bad, I have never seen it, but he seems to be a little disabled."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How about it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well...not so good, they don’t want to say too much," actually, they said it was a little devil. Pepi wisely concealed it, immediately behind Besib, who was out of the room: "The girl first found them. She said the child's father's name, asking for water, bread, a bed and protection." They brought her, and the children."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Protection?" Besib asked (calling Beppe, he said): "Who Want to murder her? Given that I haven’t taken the time yet?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chez Carson’s thin and Chegal’s not too much, there’s still obvious The smell of shower gel and shampoo, the hair is wet, dry and split, and there are scars on the face, wearing a long skirt that should belong to the women of Poseidon Island, sitting barefoot on the cold floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How did you find her?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She found us." One of Xib’s subordinates said that he has a legal identity in the Western Continent and a very good logistics company, responsible for... um, transportation, some things that are not so bright and straight, the ghost knows how Chiz knows his truth. Identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib went to the front of Chiz Carson and leaned over. Chiz’s eyes reflected the image of the young man, but she was indifferent, don’t Sib can't find something familiar in it - whether it's hatred, contempt or fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss Carson?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chiz Carson is motionless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She has been talking before," said the owner of the logistics company: "Water, bread, sleep, save us... it is Sasha. Hope "Children of Kings."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Someone is chasing her?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" No."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let me see the kids." Besib said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The child was placed in another room, a Poseidon woman was responsible for taking care of him, Besib was too focused, so that she did not notice that she was constantly drawing With a cross, and as far as possible from the crib, the cot is covered with two layers of yarn, and the Virgin on the bedboard holds a small rose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The custom of Poseidon Island is to draw the Virgin on the crib board, the boy's bed is holding the thorns in the hands of the Virgin, and the girl's bed is holding the roses in the hands of the Virgin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a girl." Beppe said in his heart that a girl is better than a boy. Besib already has a fiancee, a Beppe’s sister, and Beppe. There is a younger sister who is six years old with Sasha and fourteen years old this year, but this does not hinder the engagement (let the law go to hell), the customary rules on the sea god island, if this child (if it is determined to be Sasha), then Give it to his wife. If it is a boy, he will occupy the identity of Hopkins's eldest son, inheriting his father's family name, rights and property, but if it is just a girl, Hopkins only needs to give a copy. As a dowry trust fund, and she always has to leave - she will not have much impact on his marriage with Beck's sister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gauze covered in the small bed was opened and fixed, and the baby was shrouded in the shadow cast by the gauze. Besib was ready, they said The child is a little disabled, most likely the rabbit's lips, or it may be missing fingers or toes - he has seen such children in newspapers and on the internet - but it doesn't matter, this century's medicine is well developed, and whether it is More than Sangdi or Hopkins, they are very rich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishb bowed his head. The first thing he saw was that the white hair was smooth and shiny like a pearly skin. It’s like a great His/her father, Besib, couldn’t help but smile. He didn’t expect Sasha to have children before him, but he liked children—a girl, a cake, a doll, a kitten, a delicate little hand, and a fluffy The curls, splendid like sunshine or gold, and a pair of eyes that are as beautiful as her father, can't be removed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person who took care of him/her did not wear him the little clothes that the baby wore, only wrapped a small piece of honey-colored cotton cloth loosely, the mob The young leader gently pulled it away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The place where the arm should be left is empty, there is no **, a dark red navel looks like a wounded eye like Besib; There is no gender at all, because this monster has no legs. The place next to the abdomen is a worm-like meat-like tail-like thing, with two flat fins protruding from the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s face, mostly normal, chin, mouth, nose and cheeks, and forehead, even arguably perfect heartbreak, but it Without eyes, the eye sockets are slightly sunken and covered with smooth skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
