			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green eyes are a steady and happy young man, no, I have not mistaken adjectives, there is such a person, he can make people feel him It's worthy of credibility and reliability, and it feels close and comfortable. When you are with him, everyone will feel relaxed and brisk - between his behaviors, there is no sign of arrogance and arrogance, and he has never brought a one-and-a-half-point arrogance in his speech. Or intentional perfunctory, even at this age has become one of the deputies of the casino owner - he is only twenty-five years old, showing a smooth and restrained, fine and meticulous but like a middle or fifty-five There are talents in the year. His uncle is one of the city councillors in Las Vegas. He didn't like to go to school. He got here. He quickly liked it and fell in love with it. Las Vegas is like water to him. For the fish, the short-term working life became a formal inauguration after half a year. He worked under Shane Battier, first the waiter of the bar, then the dealer, then the dealer and the dealer, then I also worked as a money-carrying agent for a while (to pay part of the cash dividends directly to shareholders for tax evasion) and multinational collectors (to other countries to collect gambling owed by gamblers, in general, need to carry a lot of cash clearance, Very dangerous. In the latter two jobs, he was calm and bold... and ruthless. After Shawn Battier discovered this, he immediately promoted him and now he has stayed in the position of the deputy. In the first half of the year, he recruited no less than five million new businesses for the Paradise Palace Casino, and more than half a dozen "important people" (more than 10 million yuan in the casino's vault), including even Including a remote small Person and his wife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he was entertaining Besib and Sasha, he did not stupidly regard them as two truly unsophistic 14-year-old boys. There is no such exaggeration as some people to treat them as big money to greet them. His attitude is very natural and polite, and generous, with a little relatives and care. It's like the fox sitting under the apple tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I handed two black five-dollar chips to the boy’s hand, I found that they were looking at him, not the usual look, but the interest "observation." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened to me that I didn't know?" He said seriously, lowering the voice: "Well, if it is on the face Anything, please blink your eyes. If the zipper is not pulled, please double your eyes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two boys showed a mysterious smile at this time It can be seen that they have not been in vain for three years. The smile on their faces seems to be the same angle - with a little hate. Besib pinched the fingers of Sasha. He knew that Sasha had the same idea as him. The green eyes were more interesting than the roulette and blackjack - as a deputy. Although there is a good looks, but the person who likes him is not just for this. "He is almost like a banknote." Besib said, Sasha is sure of this, they are constantly coming. Someone greeted him. Of course, there is no lack of flattery and pleasing, but more is from the heart and true feelings: "I am full of joy when I see him." These people interpret this sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, nothing is wrong, you are simply perfect." Sasha said sweetly and earnestly, Besib secretly spit out his tongue and moved his shoulders. He mentioned the bag, which contained the chip in the paradise palace worth the second-to-last (the cheapest chip is two yuan), but according to its weight and volume. There is at least a thousand dollars in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is for you to play the Knicker Mac." He said that he personally took them to the front of a few new machines with bells and whistles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought that these machines can be used directly with coins." Besib tried to drop the chips, pull the pole, and the machine turned and turned, first an orange . Then there is a banana and another banana. It’s a pity that the machine spit out a white two-dollar chip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The old-fashioned machine does," said: "But they are too easy to be touched, and people throw fake coins inside - although this can be used with a scraper To distinguish and control, but the device is too easy to get stuck, in order to avoid frequent failures, most casinos stop the scraper - the problem is that there are people who can do this, see, He pointed to the two boys: "They will find a good position, make a hole in the machine, and open the engine that should be pushed away by the coin. As a result, the machine will default to the money they have already invested, they It can be played again and again, but it doesn't make any difference. But if it's a new machine, it won't work, because their internal structure and program are completely recognized only, and the chips in the casino are electronically numbered, even if you can open it. The machine, there is no continuous input of chips, the roller responsible for running is still motionless."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have heard of a way," Besib said : "Reverse with a stainless steel funnel When you live in the coin outlet, the coin-operated shrapnel that would have only leaked a few small horns was forcibly opened, and the coins will continue to flow down until the coins in the machine are leaking." He reached out and touched the coins. mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That was five or six years ago," said the company. "The coin outlet of the new machine is tilted, and the end of the clip has an automatic alarm." Function, if its work is affected, someone will come over to see it soon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha cast a black chip, the pattern in the three small grids immediately The people rolled up in a dazzling manner, and the three grids stopped at different times. The lattice from the left hand stopped first, and an apple slowly approached the bottom line, and it seemed to stop, but I did not know why it sank again. It became a banana, and the lattice in the middle stopped, orange, and the third grid was orange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's a pity." said: "It's almost a Jack." Jack is a jargon, meaning "single-handed jackpot", that is, one-third of the chips accumulated by the front guests will fall into your bag. in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is the difference between two hundred machines?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No one knows When and where it will appear," gestured the machine community that was distributed around half of the hall: "Every one is possible, a customer walks in, he drops the chips, pulls the pole, the machine turns, well. He I got three apples, the so-called single-machine Jack, but if he found that it was not just the one in front of him, but the two hundred machines around him were throwing chips together, it was really a big fortune - The first lucky one was astonished when he won the prize. He thought that the machine was broken, or that the machine was broken, or in addition to other problems, the manager invited him to the office to wait for the chip to be settled. He scared the urine. Pants."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside the West Bula, this time he was very lucky. Two apples, he got two white chips. He is eager to continue to pitch his chips and pull the pole. The time was long and short. After a while, he lost a small amount of capital that he had just won and his original. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He played with one machine, each played only once or twice, and so did Shasha. Follow them patiently and carry pockets for them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I heard the uncles say," Besib, while pulling the pole carelessly, said: "Each Taiwanese machine that handles a horn is processed. "His voice is not big, and they are in the last two rows. The nearest gamblers are also separated by nearly ten machines. "They put a metal clip on the turntable, which is the one near the apple pattern, so when the turntable is about to turn out of the apple. You can see it hesitating for a long time before suddenly turning around. In comparison, the patterns of other turntables should be in a lot of refreshment - they usually arrange it in the first one, because the second one will make people feel that the machine is in a bad position, and the third will make people feel better. Disappointing. But if the first one is 'almost' Apple, and the latter two are Apple. Many people think that this machine is very easy to get 'Jack Bao' - because people always think that the first turntable is out Apple is more likely than the last two turntables."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The inherent concept of human beings, they always feel that the first has a natural advantage." Sasha said: "We walked inside, Besib, no need to verify, Paradise Palace is the same as other casinos at this point, and the machine near the door has a low win rate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Because most of the guests who left here took out a few sporadic small chips and finally beat them. If they won the money, they would go straight to the front of the exchange desk and exchange the chips for money, go out and buy some good things or beautifully. After eating a meal, very few people will be willing to fold back and gamble again." Say: "Old gamblers will go inside."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The machine inside Winning a bigger point?" Besib stopped in front of a machine, handed in a chip, pulled the pole, turned the turn, three fruits, no one the same, this time he lost his blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Difficult to say," Sasha said: "Since you can think of it too."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We It is true that there will be one or two machines that are easy to get out of, but in the same way, only a few guests can find it in a chance, and have the patience and enough money," said happily. "Since they have already made a lot of money in front of us, then we can't count anything back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For example, this?" Besib The machine suddenly played a loud and exciting piece of music, which was mixed with enlarged, coin-sounding sounds, and multicolored lights. The top lights that emitted these beautiful lights were like a police light, and they were multicolored. On the screen, three apples are parked in the plaid of the turntable. The black chips flow out of the coin outlet, fill the hopper cup and land on the carpet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, fortunately," exclaimed with exultation: "You have a lucky hand, than Mr. Sandy, an uncompromising Jack Treasure!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I will try it too." After the machine was completely quiet, Sasha also went to cast a chip. He pulled the pole and the turntable began to turn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The summoned waiter is bending over to help Besib to pick up the chips that are falling everywhere. When they hear the music, they think it is The auditory hallucination caused by the last sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second Jack Treasure. On the same machine. A probability of one in eight thousand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(To be continued)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ps:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Sorry, I have a cold, the illness suddenly and come to the forefront, I want to be a little more on Sunday, and I can’t even sit up with a headache... I want to take a leave today, and I think there is a crucial meeting... one day Five or six tablets of sensitive sensation suppress headaches, people with backache can't afford to hurt...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
