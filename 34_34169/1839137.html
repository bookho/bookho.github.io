			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Treyf came out of the gray mist of the morning, he was more agile and lighter than Joseph Kent, and the gray-blue eyes stared at the swamp of Wuqing One by one, the two hands hang naturally, and a cleft branch is caught in the right hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He bypassed a poisonous sage, stepping on the canopy of Acacia in the white soil and climbing on the trunk, he stood above the swamp. With his eyes lowered... Two small hands squatting under his feet, the servants in the mud are getting clearer and clearer, and Streif looked at the mossy little fingers and touched his boots. They were like snakes. The outstretched tongue cautiously kissed the smooth black leather face and then shrank back in shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Straef raised the branches and stabbed straight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The branch suddenly stopped at a position less than five inches. It formed a semi-circular arc in the air, creaking, and the mud tumbling violently. The dull roar was accompanied by stinking water and plants, the soil splashed around, and Streif firmly grasped the branches, motionless, and he slowly tried to feel the force coming from the end of the branches - it came The smaller it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bright red color emerged from the dark brown sludge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Know, even Hollywood," Streif said to the swamp: "Now it’s not so fashionable to resurrect over and over again." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Mrs. Boro, this summer vacation is really bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened the day before the summer vacation is simply a precursor to the disaster. Before that, Mrs. Borrow never thought that there would be a child. A child who was just ten years old would go to frame her teacher, and she was still guilty of so terrible and guilty – she could be said to be ashamed Mr. Claude Streif keeps this secret... no matter what the facts are, this is a complete scandal. As long as it is passed out, it will inevitably bring unpredictable blows and injuries to St. Thomas Church Primary School. - She originally wanted to write a letter to Mrs. Kent in the second week after the start of the summer vacation: There is a question about Dolores Kent. Simply put, the school quota is full, so it started in September. The new semester will not be able to retain Dolores Kent's student status... So in the next two months, the Kent couple will have time to find a public school that is willing to accept her for this stubborn little girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But before she even started writing, another head of the school, Mr. Humbert, had a problem. He was missing when investigating the living conditions of the minors in the 27th district, and then appeared strangely in a far-reaching situation. In the morgue inside and outside, a few careless interns put themselves in a state of suspended animation... Oh, poor Humbert, according to the later coroner, he was probably awake at the time, but could not prove I am still alive – in short, the children of the donkeys cut him apart and found that he was still alive and kicking – it was too late. It took a lot of effort to figure out who he was. They tried to contact the family of Humbert and found that Mrs. Humbert was "supposedly" in a place with beautiful scenery, plenty of oxygen, hot springs and swimming pools. "Closed weight loss training (that is, no postbox, no phone, no network), and Hunter's daughter disappeared earlier than his father. As the most close friend and colleague of Humbert, Mrs. Bolu had to take up the work of the former two. She went to claim the body, made a transcript, wrote a letter to transfer the bad news to all relatives and friends... and her duty— - Informing the school's board of directors and the higher level department of the Parents Association of Teachers about the death of Hunter, temporarily taking over his unfinished work, dealing with his non-private affairs... that week she was too busy to breathe, and she wanted to go straight on several occasions. Climb into the coffin and rest with Humbert - if not for fear of Mrs. Hunter's misunderstanding, she might have done this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Humbert’s business finally came to an end, Mrs. Boro thought that he could finally start enjoying a leisurely holiday life, and the Kent family had something wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Mrs. Boro does not like Dolores Kent, she is essentially a gentle, kind, enthusiastic old man, and she likes Anne Kent. The impression of the Kent couple is also good, so she said that she did not want to see something irreparable in the Kent family... so when she received a call from Mrs. Kent at the hospital, she immediately let go and pay I took the other work on my hand and drove to the Kent home. She was optimistic about her family and two little girls. Mrs. Boro sincerely hopes that Mrs. Kent and her children in the belly can be safe, but it is counterproductive. The baby has not been able to live for twenty-four hours. Mrs. Kent has been greatly stimulated. Her thoughts are full of remorse. Uneasy and angry, this bad mood and the resulting delusional symptoms have even affected Dolores and Anne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, you haven’t seen more than Lores and Anne since that day?" Strath asked softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes," said Mrs. Boro. "It was a mess that day. I took the two children back to the Kent home and they were already in their bedrooms. It’s close to midnight,” she paused. She didn’t bother to tell Mr. Streif that she was asleep on the sofa in the living room of Kent’s house. “Mr. Kent came back the next morning, and I went back,” she said. Sighed: "I got a call from Mr. Kent. He sent the two children to the farm where his sister opened in Illinois. His sister would take care of the two children and wait for Mary to be discharged. Mary will also go, and in the end they may be reunited in the Haston Circle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is, they are not coming back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not coming back." Mrs. Boro said: "I will miss Anne Kent, as for Dolo. Les, I think I will think about her occasionally. She used to be a very good little girl, but I am more worried now. It is said that the school discipline in Illinois is very slack, the students are free to do whatever they want, the teacher has to pass, I I'm afraid she will get worse there - if possible, I want to talk to her. Even if she is no longer a student at our school."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "If you are worried about this," Streif said: "I guarantee that she will not do that again in the future - I talked to her once, although the time is not very long, but Dolores is very smart Maybe she can't fully understand what I mean for a while, but she can already understand a lot of things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Boro raised her eyebrows in surprise: "Can After that, it’s summer vacation. When did you talk to her?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb Sp;&nbsp;"A very occasional encounter." Streif said: "In the few days when Mr. Humbert suffered misfortune, I did not promise you to complete Mr. Humbert’s investigation work on his behalf? On the way, I met Dolores, who was playing in a community basketball court and a group of boys. I asked her to eat ice cream and juice - I think she knew where she was wrong before she left."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are a good teacher." Mrs. Boro praised: "Take your cover letter is one of the most correct things I have done in my life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am deeply honored." Streif responded happily: "Similarly, I also think that the cover letter is the best decision I made. One - I and Sasha are very fond of this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked out from the window of the classroom, in order to meet the start of school in early September, St. Thomas Church Every corner of the primary school has been cleaned up by hardworking school workers, and some places can even be said to be a dust Dyeing, the trees are cut, the water is permeable, every leaf is so green, and all the glass, metal and ceramic tiles are so bright, they can almost bring people’s attention when the sun shines on them. Burns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pure, happy, and peaceful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
