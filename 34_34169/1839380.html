			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Western World, 11% of the people are unbelievers, but even if they do, they know how the Lamb opens the seal. It’s going on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Old Testament, the sacrificed lamb was a type, and the Lamb in Revelation was fulfilled in the former, referring to the world and humanity. Suffering from redemption, and returning to the savior of heaven after death, so in the second section of the fifth volume of Revelation, the day called out loudly: "Who is with the expansion of the book, and uncover the seven seals? In heaven. On the ground and under the ground, there is no way to see the scroll. When John the Baptist cries, only the lamb with seven horns and seven eyes can take the book from the right hand of the throne. And uncover the seven seals above.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first four seals uncovered by the Lamb released four horses, red horses, and black horses. The knights of the gray horses, each representing conquest, war, hunger and death. When the Lamb unveiled the fourth seal, the four knights will bring the things they represent to the world, bringing disaster to mankind - but all Christ The people of the people are saved, brought to heaven by angels, and those who do not believe If you are guilty, you will be left on the ground - a seal will be opened, and then the next seal will be opened. The shorter the interval, the greater the disaster, the deeper the pain - and the seventh is revealed. The seal, the sky turns into a blood-like color, the trees burn, the rivers flood, the stars fall, the mountains move, the angels blow the seven numbers, the unbelievers and the sinful people are destroyed together with the earth, but the rescued people can be in heaven. Rejoining joy.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The medieval priests described the story to the ignorant nobles and the despicable free people, with a view to obtaining the gold and the last bit of food in their hands; The homes and directors of the twentieth century described this story to sentimental housewives and rebellious young people. They also had the same purpose, but they were not just as intimidating and tempting as their predecessors. Under the pen and under the lens, the apocalypse lamb, the seal and the four knights are endowed with a variety of different images and meanings, many of which are well-known works. Many are not faithful or The person who believes in the Lord has read and watched them and the film, and will find detailed information about these three because of curiosity and deeper desire to understand.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp First, is the sorrow of Stronge, and the young man of Stefan will not know this? But in his dream, the lamb is too... lively. He did not see it. There are seven horns and seven eyes, and it is only a slate under the hoof, not a scroll. Most importantly, in Stefan’s cognition, the lamb is just a generation and can stand on the throne. Before the side and the elders, how could it be a small hoof with two short-horned curled animals? Even if he is not like the supreme glory that can not be seen directly by angels, then at least It should also be better than the glory and face of the angel—and because of this, he did not immediately respond to the change of his dreams to the respectable leader. He even began to suspect that what he got was not a revelation, but one after another, especially for children, the continuation of boring childish fantasies. He thinks so. So on the second day, he threw it behind his head and rushed into the heavy and noble school. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since this dream has never appeared again, Stefan’s heart is more determined, but two days before the Holy Spirit’s coming, he received a phone call and the one took him. He educated him and directed his priest to a car accident. His legs were broken, the pelvis was shattered, and broken steel was inserted into the spine. He was so old that no doctor could guarantee him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stefan rushed back overnight. His benefactor was lying on the hospital bed, his breath was weak, but he could still hear and talk to him, and Stefan was surprised. The priest still remembers the unreliable revelation, he hesitated, but truthfully said - that bizarre dream, and his thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest’s silence made him feel terrified, although the old man did not let him see his disappointment – ​​Stefan returned to the chapel, the priest was He kept the room, the deacon gave him a hot corn soup and salted bread, and the priest gave him a pillow, a blanket and a scorpion, a bed sheet - just like he was still haggling, or that dirty Hungry, skinny, except that the Bible with the broken cover and the clothes that you wear have nothing to do - just now the room is not as empty and tall as he or he is, he grew up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He could not sleep, preparing to pray all night, for the father-like old man, but at dawn, he once again came to the ignorance The sacred heavenly palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the altar, the lamb beat the hoof, but the ground did not split, he looked down, originally, or he thought it was a white and smooth ground engraved with fine and compact The text, which reads: "...There is a two-legged person sitting in the city of Ruth, who was born with a lame, never walked. He listened to Paul and said, Paul fixed his eyes on him and saw him have Confidence, you can get cured, and say out loud: 'You get up, your feet stand straight!' The man jumped up and walked."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was puzzled I want to ask, but the temple collapses and he falls back to the mortal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a voice whipping Stefan. He didn’t talk to anyone and went straight to the hospital. The nurse was very surprised when he received the call. Refused him, because it was still five o'clock in the morning, not visiting time, and finally Stefan's appearance, and the profession of him and the visitee persuaded her and the doctor on duty, they went to see the priest and found He is already awake and willing to receive his disciples and adopted children. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stefan’s hand held the Bible tightly, and the doctor and nurse had left, leaving him and the priest in the ward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man looked at him and seemed to know what was going to happen. He neither doubted nor urged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stefan opened the Bible, it is very old, the paper is yellow and the corners are worn, although its owner has always used it very carefully. - Even if you don't even use the page number, Stefan turned to "14" 8-10. The gray-black letters are so clear on the ivory pages and have been used by the masters of this Bible. I have read it and recited it many times, but now, the person holding it can't make even a syllable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or also a voice is saying to the priest, so when Stefan couldn’t speak, the priest shouted: "I believe, I believe. I took Jesus to go, the Lord can solve all the problems, the Lord has nothing to do!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, it is like being removed from the throat lock. Stefan read the paragraph. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, as the peers said, the priest was healed immediately. He stood up and was able to walk, more relaxed than before the car accident. Before the day dawned, the priest found a trustworthy friend. He was a doctor and a devout believer, under the insistence of him and his priest. The priest left the hospital in the name of the transfer the next day and returned to his chapel that night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides Stefan, himself, doctor friend, church priest and deacon. There is no sixth person who can know this miracle. The priest persuaded friends, priests and friends - to convince them that it is not appropriate to expose this sacred display to the eyes of the world immediately. This is not to despise the grace. Refused to grace. On the contrary, it is a good gratitude and protection - for Stefan. He is still young, his mind is not sound enough, his beliefs are not strong enough, he still needs the help of the Lord to move on – to publicize this to others, to immerse the whole young man in the whirlpool of questioning, ridicule and worship. Not help. Instead, it prematurely obscures and even cuts off the glory of the Lord upon him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But he said to Stefan, if Stefan is willing to preach this miracle to the world - he is willing to stand up to prove and accept the inspection. When did the young man have no vanity and frivolity? And he knows that Stefan once loved his biological father so much, and if it is clear that there is something to prove, he may be taken back to Strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Paul said: Since it is called, acting as a person is to be commensurate with the grace of calling," said Stefan. There is no trace of joy on his face: "He has proved to me, what can I take now to pay back? - My father, my body is still in this world, and my heart is being cast Burning in hell."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said this, kissed the priest's hand and returned to the seminary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stefan continued his studies in the seminary, and it seemed that nothing had happened, but he began to watch the night regularly, long time fasting prayers And the whip, his teachers were deeply worried and dissuaded. They were worried that this outstanding student would be disabled and even die because of too much piety. Stefan followed their opinions and checked. The results were good. He used this to insist on his behavior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is also an assignment," he said to the teachers. "It’s just not for you."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second year he graduated from the seminary, he returned to the priest’s chapel to be a deacon, and in the third year of the Immaculate Conception, he received a new revelation, the fourth year. He left the chapel, rushed and swayed to every corner of the western continent. He helped many people and gained their gratitude and support. He also hurt some people. Their hatred and hatred went hand in hand. In the seventh year, He went to the FBI's list of wanted criminals. In the tenth year, he became a "institution" list of VIPs. In the sixth year after he left the chapel, the priest called the priest and the deacon and told them that he was about to die. He accepted the holy oil and went to God. I made the last prayer and repentance, then I lay in bed, holding the cross, waiting quietly for the last sleepiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first seventy years of life, the priest always believed that he would return to the heavenly home, but now he can’t say that again, Although he is still pious, but he is blessed, he must be rewarded - the sages of BC return with pain and death, and he and Stefan return with silence and crime - they accepted this very early The arrangement also clearly knows that he can never become a bride of Christ again, sit down in the imperial temple and enjoy peace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(To be continued)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ps:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
