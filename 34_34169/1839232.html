			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coloreck buried himself in the white salted lobster and golden salt and pepper barbecue, he was not interested in Gregory’s proposal - the two After the children, especially after Ossian Douglas, the attitude of the Carson family was not used on two dispensable pieces and chips. Kane Carson personally came to the school and the principal. After talking for a long time, the content of their agreement was naturally not something that Chennike could know, but the special and secret treatment that was followed by Sasha Hopkins and Besib. It is something that everyone with long eyes can see, especially the teachers who perform it - everyone is unaware of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like this, children who have been vigorously cultivated by the family, of course, will not really let them go to be a singer or an actor. It’s easy to get people’s attention, but it’s hard to get their respect. The history of the Western Confederation is not long, only two hundred years. In these two hundred years, a total of fifty-three presidents were sworn in, and they only One once worked as an actor and he was called a legend. And Chen Neike has long discovered that some of Bessib’s thoughts are as stubborn as the old man who was born before this century. He still insists that women stay at home, cook laundry, have children, and care for the elderly; Their brothers, fathers and even sons should work hard outside to support and burden the whole family, just like the pillars in the house. Think of it here, Chennike grinned, the boy is very smart, he has never been The female teacher mentioned this before, and even did not miss it at all. Sophie, who had a quarter of the course on his vacation, praised him for Besib, saying that he was courteous and polite. Good-looking boy--oh, he really wanted to tell Sophie that men in the 18th and 9th centuries also respect women, but they never thought of them as "the kind of person" who could compare with themselves. They are the same as Besib. A woman who is too curious and concerned about the outside world, who is self-righteous and chattering, will make them feel impatient. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comparatively, a man who lives with his face and voice will be regarded as self-deprecating and unwilling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for Little Hopkins, it’s a complicated child, Colorneck thinks, maybe Gregory is the one who blends with him and interacts with each other. The feeling of contradiction is attracted. He has the calmness of adults, the melancholy of young people and the tranquility of the elderly. He seems to know nothing about his charm, but he will use it skillfully at the necessary moments; It seems that there has been a firm and clear goal. But at some point, he will be confused and overwhelmed; he seems innocent, pure and transparent. But it is always elusive and difficult to master; most importantly, he is very arrogant, yes, arrogant. It doesn't mean that the nose is out of the sky and the childish and straightforward malice - he is not the second Boa. Noel Douglas, he is just outside - he never cares what he thinks he doesn't need to care about, Including the recognition and love of others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the two boys are rich enough, they have never tasted the embarrassment of embarrassment, and Gregory is disappointing. He didn't have the things to attract the two boys. They were really ambitious, but unfortunately this ambition was doomed that they would not start from a plaything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All that Gregory did must be in vain. Poor old friend, Chenneck decided to drink a few more cups, and mourned for the failure of his fate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I saw this for the first time." Besib said, He looked at the studio and watched the concert with the studio and seemed to be seen only in science fiction movies. The panel with its colorful light dazzled him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is generally not allowed for non-related personnel to enter." The sound engineer said that he found a comfortable chair for Besib. Arrange him to sit in the chair, cleverly isolate him from the machine, give him snacks and cola (these are secretly stored here): "With a straw, boy," he said: "The bubbles of this cola are It's not easy to get to the nose. But be careful, you will never know how much the carpet is worth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you." Besib said He waved his hand at a friend who was separated by a thick, transparent glass. There are several film companies in Cicale Bissand, and if he is interested in seeing what is recorded, it can be better arranged than the subordinates of Sangdi - but Bishb never feels that he needs to pay attention to this, he is a singer. He was not very interested in movie stars. He didn't even think about becoming a sound engineer, but he knew that a studio was probably worthy of geometry, because a "uncle" in charge of the film company once laughed at his third-rate actor. For fifty years (if he can still be welcomed in movies and bed during these 50 years), it is possible to get half a professional studio. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said," Besib asked before he officially started: "Why do you want to record?" The last concert of Xiqiao was " The real theme is that all the sounds will not be spread after a certain manual blending as before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have to listen to the results first," the sound engineer said. "We have to know what the sound of Xiqiao and the plucked piano are really working together." Feeling." The chorus around him licked him and said "Gregory" with his mouth. The recording studio is not easy to detect, nodding, the old tricks of acting agents, they sometimes encounter some Enthusiastic about the limelight and the goal of making money, then they will try their best to bring him here, bring them there, let them feel part of the life of the "red man", of course, just the part of glamour and glory, Like those filthy and ugly things they will hide, even a little smell can not smell, even if they are asked, they will only categorically say that it does not exist at all - is someone drinking? No, it’s just that you accidentally drank two more cups; did someone take drugs? No, it’s just being framed by people; is there anyone who is homosexual? God, who doesn't have one or two boyfriends? As for the same sex, it is only a moment of curiosity; there are ** easy, sexual bribery and sadism and abuse - the media always loves fuss, noisy, how many changes? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They used rhetoric and unscrupulous means to wave the golden contract like a devil waving a sell, and the sound engineer and the chorus saw much more. The chorus was glad that he had not been able to enter the "circle" he had dreamed of because of the scar left by a car accident. In the past few years, what he saw has made him very awake - it is a dirty swamp. It’s clean and beautiful, the energetic people go in, the acne is covered, and the skinny shackles come out – no one can escape the greed and thorough sucking of the “water scorpion”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The glass door of the concert room is closed, the red light on the door lights up, like the lights on the operating room door, all of them start to get Serious and silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha Hopkins put his hand on the plucked piano, the recorder put his hand on the slider of the machine, and the sliders seem to have hundreds Thousands of huge recorders are slowly turning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishb did not open the cola, did not enjoy any snacks, he piled them under his feet, the atmosphere in the studio affected him, those professionals I really love my job. They concentrate on their eyes and have huge headphones on their ears. The sound engineer communicates with Sasha at the end of the first section of the simple exercise chapter, instructing him to follow their pre-set directions. Besib Only concerned about his friends, he stood up, but did not approach, just standing in the field, he was not sure if Hopkins could see himself, the machine standing in front of the glass and the wall was very high, and there were several tall Men stand in front of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can see Hopkins very clearly, his friend unexpectedly fits this room, a place that is isolated, only himself And a plucked piano, the recording microphone hangs from the top of the ceiling and gathers around him and the piano to capture every subtle or huge sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brightness of the concert room is very low, but fortunately Besib can also see things under the faint light - Sasha Hopkins face There is no expression on the top, it is a kind of blank that is relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the first part of the work came to an end, the sound engineer came over: "Do you want to hear your friend's performance?" The child is very awkward, he I think, if he didn't pee on the carpet, he might be able to hope that the earphones worth $4,500 would not be broken by him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you can," Besib said: "Thank you very much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
