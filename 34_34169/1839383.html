			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felice Winston originally planned to stay in Manchester for only one day. Her assistant booked her plane for the evening of the opening ceremony, but she felt that she had It is necessary to stay one more day. On the second day, she finally arrived at the water, the son who is not thinking about it. In a restaurant opened by a Chinese, there are pineapple and simmered chicken (fried chicken with sweet sauce), broccoli beef. And steamed dumplings, she pretended to unintentionally mention the man who had discussed the ham and black eyed peas twenty years ago. Quinta nodded, "Yes, Mom," he said. "There is a Hopkins, the same suite as me, but not a bedroom." - What's the matter with you?" He picked up a piece of chicken and chewed it into his mouth before he found his mother's face very bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mom?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Father-to-child relationship?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Should be," Quinta said, playing the broccoli on the plate with a fork: "No, I don't know, but I saw them standing together, it's exactly the same from the back. Turning around, it is also very similar, but Sasha is much more beautiful than his father."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felice lowered his head and thought for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you change the dormitory?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All freshmen must live together, Quinta said with patience: "I thought you knew."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just change a suite?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That doesn't work," Quinta said. "I really like my current room and my roommates."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But Living there will make me scared - given that Mr. Hopkins has such a close relationship with the one I mentioned."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Have you ever been a food show collaborator and your former psychiatrist?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A criminal," Phyllis said: "A serial murderer and a cannibal Change state."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quinta's look became dignified: "He killed someone?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "So he is now on parole?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, he got a special offer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Wait," Quinta confusely pushed the plate in front of him: "Since you said that the serial murderer, that is to say, he not only killed a person? How did he get parole? "One third of the Western Region has no death penalty, but as long as you kill someone and prove guilty." Your sentence can last for up to seven hundred years, and it is impossible to get parole in the first fifty years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, because... some evidence has disappeared, some testimonies have been overthrown... and a group of witnesses ran out to testify for him." Phyllis reluctantly I swayed my hand: "For this, I lost a lot of money. Finally, there were only one or two insignificant minor charges on Dr. Hopkins. Our former president generously signed an amnesty for him. But "Fillis lowered his voice: "Son, I know, he is not so innocent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quinta pulls back the plate, subconsciously The fork glared at the broccoli that had been devastated by him for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But," he replied in the same subtle voice: "Father is a criminal, not a son is a criminal."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe Mr. Little Hopkins is a good boy who is law-abiding. But he has a dangerous mad father," Phyllis held his son's hand across the table. "Who knows when his father will think that you are obstructing or hurting his son? Believe me, many people think that Dr. Anthony Hopkins is a gentle gentle gentleman. I know very well that he may not be a A disgusting villain. It’s a ruthless, ugly guy, you never think about what’s in his mind.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“As long as I’m in Manchester - Mom, we live together, we have a common restaurant, library, gym... We have the same course in the last two years, if you want me to stay away from Hopkins - OK, I am leaving Manchester. Going to college elsewhere, that's fine. Can you really do this?” Quinta said: “We have been fighting for it for fifteen years!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, Quinta does not believe that Mr. Little Hopkins would be the kind of person who brought bad luck. He liked the boy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Quinta convinced his mother. He assured her that he would keep a distance from Sasha Hopkins, not to quarrel with him or fight with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If, I mean." Phyllis said: "If there is anything... not too good, I think you can take a break - one A short time?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“If anything bad happened.” Quinta raised three fingers and swears: “I will stop taking a semester immediately, another one. Semester." The two-semester time is one year, and the second-year students can freely combine and apply to other dormitory colleges. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The administrator of the new dormitory is a fourth-grade student, Brian Dupont, It has a smooth golden brown hair, which is what people call linen, and the eyes are brown, like the Asian one, but his surname can guarantee the blood flowing in his body because of the DuPont family. The people will only be married in the cousin to ensure that the family wealth does not flow out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His invitation is a privilege for a freshman, but it may also contain some curiosity and temptation - thanks to his last name, Brian DuPont was able to see the application materials for each high school student like the interviewer in Manchester. Sasha Hopkins was the student who decided to give him more exposure in the first round. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha Hopkins needs to do the work is not urgent, but it is very important - a map is dedicated to the new students, including : large and small supermarkets, shopping areas, specialty stores, food markets, second-hand goods stores - need to indicate the transportation route (driving, bus and walking), as well as business hours; there are cafes, bars, fast food restaurants, Street foods - in addition to transportation routes and business hours, they also need to be marked with price and features, such as: Chinese, Indian, Japanese and Thai, as well as pizza, cake, roast chicken, etc. - if marked People's recommendations are the best. This map is distributed to the freshmen every year, in order to ensure that the above information is not wrong (after all, every mall and restaurant may close and open at any time, except for a few people who have a relationship with Manchester, they are not Will greet the students and teachers responsible for this work), this map will be updated every semester. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
