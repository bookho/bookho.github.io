"Especially, I may be able to stick to it for a while." Maybe an hour? Do you think they have this time and manpower to do this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look," Sasha continued: "Sometimes privilege is not What a good thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next he didn’t talk, Little Hopkins’s heart was full of anxiety, he rushed into his own while he was awake Thought opened the door to Besib, but he was hindered behind a layer of impenetrable walls. His father told him that such a phenomenon would happen on three premise: 1. He met a strong The person with his mental ability (maybe); 2. The person's brain is in a state of being out of service (just like you can't enter a house without a door); 3. That person is completely dead (same 2). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two young people are silently lying under the cable car, the back of the cable car is a reinforced light brown plexiglass, together with those metal products, quality It’s worthy of a good compliment. Hundreds of tons of snow calmly cover them. Every breath they breathe is precious and can’t be regained. Brian is trying to slow down the frequency of breathing as if it would make more Oxygen remained - the snow on their cheeks melted, infiltrated into the collar, and it was cold and dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We may not be far from the snow?" Brian knows that it is not suitable for talking now, they are better to hibernate like a turtle, but he It’s really unbearable. Not everyone can calmly and calmly face the threat of death. It’s just without warning and... I hope that even if he was attacked by Avery Famo, he was not so scared. . Man, even the abilities, his danger can never be compared with nature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This avalanche is artificial," Sasha said softly. "Not a natural avalanche, so it is not a snow avalanche but a plate avalanche. Its striker didn't roll us up but pushed us directly along with the cable car. Then it stopped in the hawthorn part because the power was exhausted. The rear snow blocks rolled over them and piled up, there are several explosion points, now The snow of a mountain is piled up on us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So say..." Brian shuddered and said, "We have no hope."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha did not answer. In the dark, what cautiously touched Brian's fingers, the older male almost jumped up - if not the cable car is also buckled on him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have done a locust test, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brian certainly knows his side This child is also an actor. It is said that he can make the abilities stronger, and his power seems to be used by ordinary people. "Yes." Brian said: "I don't have this potential." At that time, he felt quite good. After all, the abilities were still a minority. Like most people, he likes to be normal. just now? He hopes that he can have the ability to pierce the wall and spurt the fire from the mouth and melt the snow. Or become a strong man, you can. Just let him live. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He couldn’t contain the thought of Ferrola Famo, a woman with a bull on her body, she was so lucky that she didn’t have to face such a deep torture, How unfortunate she did not even have the last few minutes - and Avery Famo, and their parents, their deaths are as fast as Ferrola - this may be God's will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snow that melted into the water flows into every tiny gap, and Brian remembers that Ferrola’s blood is so full of her body, she It must also feel very cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Say something," said Brian, with a few prays, although the reason that he told him that it was likely to be missing would determine his life and death. But he doesn't want to leave the world in loneliness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I used to use my power on ordinary people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know, Brian said frankly: "He is alive, but he has not become a power."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Some people think that abilities are completely genetic."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The correct rate is high," Sasha said: "I want to try Try?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to see if you are likely to be an actor." Sasha said, it’s usually like asking Brian if he has Interested in joining a swimming club or going to play rugby. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Hopkins suddenly stopped his steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghoul's reddish-brown eyes look straight into the distance, the gray-blue waters and the dark green islands, the white clouds cover the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Open the door." He said in a dark and unclear tone: "Child, I am looking at you."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s almost impossible to get immediate rescue. The snow caused by the avalanche is unstable and may collapse at any time. Dumping can create new victims at any time, and they have only a few d-type shovel, and the probes indicate that the shallowest part of the avalanche snow is also thirty feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A rescuer carefully moved on the snow block and found that his probe was slightly, slightly imperceptibly vibrating, he was uneasy Looking out of the ground, a huge snowboard appeared a dendritic crack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a professional who does not need to think too much about him and makes the right choice. He immediately evacuates and tells the news aloud to others. - This is not the most suitable rescue time. The problem is that the people buried below are too important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More and more snow blocks began to split and tremble, as if they were still over 1200 feet, rescuers repeatedly retreated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that something is coming up." A rescuer groaned and regretted that he should not watch too many horror movies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing appears, at least it is invisible. At first, only small snowballs and branches are floating, but then the d-type shovel is also shattered. Snow, they are divided into blocks, each one is as big as a human body or a vehicle. They hesitate to float in the air, some will fall down, some will be thrown far away, and finally a thorough The big eruption, with strange roars, everything was violently thrown into the air, including a bad luck who was not far enough away. When he was thrown down, the two men ran up to him. Fortunately, the place where he fell was very flat, there was no snow, and the starting point was not very high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the two men helped the friends who had been taken up by the sky and then put down with politeness and gentleness, the matter was over. Everyone was stunned and looked at the place where there was probably a football field. It was emptied. As literally. Snow and floating soil and vegetation were evenly ejected into the air and the ground within about half a hectare. A few twisted and twisted cable cars, blue, yellow, red, and so on, some motionless. And some raised their hands to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha turned his head and smiled at Brian Dupont, who was amazed at his strength: "Wonderful."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He feels Besib. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment is coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stefan has been sleeping and eating for a week, he only drinks water and adds salt to it. Every morning, after the morning prayers and evening prayers, I beat my back with a bitter whip, and I was wearing a woven linen shirt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final prediction is close at hand. Finally, he got this divine purpose in the early hours of the eighth day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Call them," he said to Elder Josiah: "We can go to meet the Messiah."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl woke up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She remembered Mr. Samuel’s request and jumped out of bed without wearing shoes. Her head hurts strangely, her face is wet, but she wants Mr. Samuel to be happy. Everything was taken care of - she found Mr. Samuel in the hallway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I saw it this time," she said cheerfully. "It’s very clear." Her eyes sparkled with joy: "He took the boy’s hand and the boy let everything fly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mountain, there is a lot of snow." She said, feeling that the nostrils are itchy, something has flowed from the inside, She smoked her nose in a shy manner, but there was no effect at all. The hot liquid flowed on her lips. She raised her hand and tried to erase it. She was caught by Samuel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is that a dark-haired boy?" Samuel asked, taking out a handkerchief from his pocket and wiping off the blood on the girl's face and mouth, and carefully folded it out to be discovered by her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, it’s golden brown."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is Brian Dupont," Mr. Samuel said: "He passed the locust test, he should be an ordinary person, do you confirm?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Yes," girl closed Looking up at the eyes, I remembered it hard. In her dream, the sky was very bright. She was only a few steps away from the boy and could even see his brown eyes: "Yes."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood has flowed out of her nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr.?" she asked awkwardly. When she remembered her father and mother, she told them what she had dreamed of - she dreamed of Dodge The priest was wearing a skirt; she dreamed that a bad boy had a hole in the head next to her; she dreamed that her mother was hiding in the bathroom and gave herself a shot. The medicine in the syringe was white; she dreamed that Dad and her aunt were tightly attached. Together, the kind of nakedness; as long as she said it, they would always violently scream, slap her slap in the face, and order her to shut up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One day she dreamed that her parents had teamed up to immerse her in the bathtub, the transparent blisters cracked over the top of the head, the feeling of suffocation was so vivid, she was scared to escape It is. She was very hungry and very cold. She saw the old man who gave her something to eat in her dreams. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Samuel tells her that her abilities are rare and precious. He raises her and trains her to "see" with a goal, but in the past few years she The most watched is the golden-haired boy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(To be continued)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(There was a small mistake in the previous chapter - ah, So I stopped for another two days because... I thought I should have several chapters, but I found that some things should not be described in detail, and the original drafts always feel that they are not quite right, so you may see them after the deletion. To a quick ending - the most hesitant thing is that this ending may seem a bit hasty, the problem is that I and Sasha feel that it is over, um, that's it, tomorrow, the finale, maybe a chapter, It is also possible that two chapters, not everyone's ending will be explained in detail, but this book is indeed finished) (to be continued). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
