			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter 62—The Day of the Virgin (2)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Sasha was not born, Anthony Hopkins often dances with Sasha's mother at dinner, sometimes skipping after dinner, and as soon as they like, Catherine jumps on the table and Hopkins jumps up and they In silver cutlery, candlesticks, crystal glasses, dark napkins, flowers move in the footsteps, the background is the moon in the red sky, they don't need music, because all the music is stored in their minds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The music is ringing, people move to the lawn, dance in pairs, once Anthony Hopkins, now Crowder Streif came out of his memory, and he reached out to Miss Kemira and invited her to dance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took the hand of the female intern, the female intern was tall, about five feet and eight inches, and the bones and muscles developed very well. Mr. Treff first placed the other hand on her waist, but immediately found that it would make her stiff, so he followed a chance to turn around and put his finger on her lower back, just like Pushing her gently - it makes their distance inevitably close, but avoiding the sensitive waist side, Miss Kemira's muscles are no longer so tight, she dances Light and warm, with a clean soapy smell and her scorpion perfume, this is a low-end perfume from France, the price is not expensive - Streif re-emerged in his memory Going, Catherine danced with him at the time. They were close together, their knees collided occasionally, they often stopped, lazily swaying and hugging, the husband’s head on his wife’s shoulder, his nose Below is Catherine's soft and plump chest/skull, tiny sweat The beads hang on the golden skin, and the too high body temperature will completely evaporate the perfume made by the traditional manual method. They pull the head of Hopkins like a pair of soft tentacles, he is taken by them. Seductive, coercive, he bent down, closed his eyes, and let his face cling to the place where Catherine's heart beat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dance slowly stopped, people stopped moving, and Mr. Streif had an interesting discovery, and Miss Kemira was also deeply immersed in herself. In her thoughts, she looked melancholy, slow-moving, her eyes fixed on a place, like the "Pan" (Greek farmer) who would jump out of a goat's hoof at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You're fine," Mr. Streif said. "Your face is very bad. I think you should take a break."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He semi-forced to bring Kemira into a shade of thick trees, where a dozen children gathered, and they clapped their hands to welcome the two teachers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you playing games?" Kemira said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just chatting, Teacher Kemira." A girl replied shyly, sitting next to the tree roots, wrapped around a finger Little purple cicada; "We are talking about food."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are talking about the strangest thing we have ever eaten." A boy inserted and said: “Mom once made a mistake of jam and pepper sauce, and my dad and I ate jam steak and pepper sauce pie.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“This is nothing remarkable,” Another boy said: "My grandfather and I have been to the food festival in New Zealand in Marchica every March, where we smoked salmon and worm chocolate candy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous boy showed his expression of vomiting: "Do you eat that stuff? The worm is not food at all!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think we It’s the 'peculiar' food,” a girl retorted. “The worm can of course eat. I have also eaten the cockroaches and bees.”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Children know what the tricks of cockroaches and honey are. Their biological textbooks have the most detailed explanations and colored illustrations. They also observed these two under the guidance of the teacher. Insects of insects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is the taste?" He spoke of a boy who was obviously overweight. He was full of eagerness and seemed to drool at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Girl shrugs: "It's very sweet, it tastes like a fried shrimp, and the bee sting is a bit sweet. In short, it tastes good."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey...you got there...I mean, is there any other, delicious game?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Chinatown." The girl is very excited: "My country teaches me to go to the night market there, you can never imagine that they can create so many delicious things - I have eaten chicken Paws, very spicy, but no bones, very delicious, and pig ears, mixed with vinegar and parsley, crisp and tender... I always thought that it was a snack for the puppy... I I also saw the stomach of a cow cut into pieces in a steamer. They called it the leaves of a cow..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Chinese eat everything." "The first boy to talk was dissatisfied. He felt that he was left out: "They also eat the fins and nests of fish. They will eat the whole earth sooner or later..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tom! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The children were shocked by the harsh tone, especially Tom. He didn't understand what he said and made Miss Kemira suddenly furious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Kemmilla’s beautiful face rose red without warning. She looked at the confused students and searched for the right sentence. So that you can get rid of each other's bad situation as soon as possible - it is Mr. Claude Streif who is helping out in time.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not saying "Exactly, dear Tom," Streaf said bluntly: "And this statement is very unfair to the Chinese, because people in other countries do not have more food than the Chinese. Smaller - if you move the time a little earlier, then it is even bigger - people in the Middle Ages will cherish every part of the animal, the pig is a very common animal at that time, ears, tongue, tail, mouth Even **, all will enter the sputum; and the intestines, bladder, stomach will be used for casings, or resurrection When the artificial Dome. The children widened their eyes: "All the birds and animals that are hunted, swan, peacock, donkey, mountain?, ostrich, red-crowned crane, lark, and the swan and peacock are not very tasty, but they will be together The beautiful feathers are put together on the table; the animals include bears, monkeys, wild boars, deer, rabbits... and hedgehogs and arrow pigs, which can be seen from the fact that their names contain pigs; In addition, there are a large number of fish. At that time, the fish refers to all the things floating on the water, so whales, dolphins, and beavers are also a kind of fish, and people eat them on the fasting day. Mr. Streif thought about it and added: "If you push a little further forward, the Roman recipes can arouse people's curiosity - they eat dormouse, honey flax-flavored slumber, and There is a black pudding made of pig blood. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now even Miss Kemira can't help but open her mouth.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Now, the whole earth is still full of human food, Icelanders eat shark meat that is fermented after drying, Sardinians use locusts to make their sauce cheese, and many Italian bars have succulent sandwiches to eat. It looks like smoked ham, Africans eat ostrich meat and eggs, Norwegians eat squid meat soaked in alkali, the main material of a dish in the Australian desert is hibiscus moth larvae, Mexicans put ant eggs on tacos Eat inside, Korean octopus is still alive when it is served on the table - this dish is very particular, it is best to let people feel their suckers suck their mouth and tongue when they devour the octopus. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The children caught their mouths as if the octopus was squirming in their mouths. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My God," the first thing that gasped was the little girl who was fascinated by the chicken feet and the beef stomach. Her eyes glowed: "Do you eat these?" Have you ever been?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Straef looked at her, a child with a unique taste – he knew that some people bought sealed chicken feet and cows from Chinatown. Stomach - Take it back and joke with your child, many children will cry because of their weird appearance: "Yes." His acknowledgment exchanged for a nearly sigh of reverence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The children naturally questioned Mr. Streiff, the food he tasted the most exotic must be very interesting, almost everyone thought so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," Mr. Streif was a little confused and turned his head. He thought for a while and opened his hands; "For me, He said softly: "No food can be called peculiar."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The children were dissatisfied with this answer, but for some nature of the shun, they did not continue to ask, but turned their attention to Kemira. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Chicken." Kemira replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is that?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Chicken's stomach," the female teacher replied: " A strong muscle, sold in the supermarket, and the heart of the chicken, if you want to try it," she smiled: "Slice, put some pepper and stir-fry, tastes good."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Streif can conclude that she did not tell the truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He carefully observed this new colleague, just like checking a piece of famous ham or cheese - Kemila's looks are very commendable. Her hair is linen, although it is not as beautiful as Catherine's blond hair, but the victory is fine and smooth; a pair of rare, mossy green eyes, like the witch's cat, shines brightly, people like green eyes, second only to Blue, many writers give them a pair of green eyes while giving them the superb wisdom and commendable courage; the high and correct nose, then the lips, her lips are not as broad and rich as most people It may make the person who kisses her feel uncomfortable, but it is suitable for her slightly thin face; her neck is as thin as a swan, but she can't see the bones and veins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
