			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the sacrifices that the Israelites have given to the Lord's sacred objects, I will give you and your children, as a eternal share, this is for You and your descendants are eternal salt in the presence of the Lord. ——民数记<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The passage of the young priest with Sasha is not spacious, even narrow, and the wall is rough, the light is dim, the ground Rugged. The two walked silently about two hundred and forty feet, and the priest pushed open another door. Before the light, the calm and sweet smell poured into the dark sorrow. Sasha closed his eyes. It was very pure. It smelled like a scent of conifers, mixed with the cold and sharp winter fog. Only From the junction of the desert and the mountainous area in the southwestern part of the peninsula, the talents produced in the promenade area filled with fog all year round have this feature. It is recognized as one of the best in the world, and the output is also quite low. High prices are also certain – but for the sects of the “Eleventh” system that has been inherited since 1,500 years ago (that is, the believers have to donate one-tenth of their income to the church), This cost can be said to be low enough to be negligible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The small Hopkins is in front of the third-largest chapel in both size and height. Its walls and domes are white and white. There are huge chandeliers hanging from them, but the light in the chapel does not come from them. The soft and clean white light is infiltrated from the walls and domes. The craftsmen five hundred years ago have a sincere faith and no support. Lundi's enthusiasm and unimaginable dexterity created this miracle - they polished the white stone to an unprecedented thinness, so thin that it allowed light to pass through, so that even if the entire building does not have a window, it is in the day. It also does not need to light candles or Unicom power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, at that time. This feat can only be attributed to the spokesperson of God and God, whose name is engraved on the pedestal of the pillars and statues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a small mass in the chapel, which is really strange, because today is Friday, it is not a good day for most believers, it is said The earliest Adam and Eve were eaten on Friday, and Jesus was crucified on Friday. The first flood in human history began on Friday. Believers will avoid going out on Friday or starting a new project on Friday. They believe that the scourge and misfortune symbolized by Friday will follow any matter that is linked to this day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest and Sasha walked to the end of the chapel with a single walk, and it was a very serious sin to disturb the mass, in general. The misplaced person will sit down and work with the participants and the participants to complete the mass. Fortunately, the mass has come to an end, they don't have to wait too long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Because the time has come, the judgment will start from the house of God. If we start with us first, those who do not believe in the gospel of God. What will happen? The end of the story?...that is, the angels have sinned, and God has not been tolerant. They have been thrown into hell, and they are placed in dark pits, waiting for judgment... The Lord knows that the godly man is saved from temptation, leaving the unrighteous in Under the penalty. Waiting for the day of judgment... But now the heavens and the earth, by the life, remain until the day when the ungodly is judged and degraded. Burned with fire..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the prayer, there is a man’s voice that is extraordinarily thick and loud, like the church’s bronze bell, screaming in everyone’s ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Holy Spirit is taken, the Lord's sacrifice raises the Eucharist to display and says, "Look at the Lamb of God. See the exhortation of the sinner, call Blessed are the people who come to the feast."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As long as you say a word, my soul will heal!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the whole mass is to be completed, it is naturally inevitable to lead the Eucharist. The priest and Sasha go to the front after everyone has received the Eucharist. Among the people who received the Eucharist before them, some of them had already been jealous. When he received the Eucharist, he refused the support and shelf of others, and supported his body with both hands to raise his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Christ's Eucharist." The Lord's sacrifice said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Amen." His voice echoed throughout the chapel, and the organ group behind the altar seemed to tremble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they sang the hymn under the guidance of the aids: "The Lamb of God, take away the sin of the earth, give him rest; the Lamb of God, take away the sins of the world Give him eternal rest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the crowd of more than 100 people dispersed, the organizers of the small mass (all of them are male) and The priest and Sasha shook hands, and the old man was seated in a wheelchair with the support of two young boys. His palm was soft like a piece of bread soaked in water. Wrinkles spread in his face, forehead, neck and other exposed places, deep gullies, dark brown markings spliced ​​into pieces, amazing, his eyes have no tendency to smoky, it is as clear as a baby The iris is a very pale blue, almost identical to the white sclera. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The one is Jared Strong," after they left the chapel, the priest said: "A local elder who respects tradition, is respected and respected."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the mass of the soul," Sasha said: "What is the person who is being recommended?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost only one, But the priest's face did show a distressed look, "...he's wife."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"噢," Sasha said. He did not continue to pursue, but began to appreciate this magnificent grand chapel - the chapel's ground is colorful, mosaics of religious paintings and symbolic symbols and various circles, squares, lines will The ground floor is full, on the contrary, the oak seats in the chapel are simple and simple, with a row next to each other. The place on the back of the chair that is used to place the palm of the hand is bright and shiny by the Capricorn, presenting a moving Deep reddish brown, there is no cross and no god behind the white sermons. There is only one wall of the organ. Sasha once read in a book describing the supervising sect that there are countless supervisors who are proud of this. The description of the favorite large instrument, the book says that it has a total of 11,000 sound tubes. The shape of the expansion is like the wings of an angel. It can be as loud as a thunder, and it can whisper like a dove. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This chapel can accommodate nearly 2,000 members and two hundred priests and elders,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they will not say anything anymore. Sasha found that the young priest obviously has considerable rights and power here. They can be said to be unimpeded, whether it is a chapel, a chapel, or three. A small chapel, or a baptismal hall, a vows hall (a wedding oath, a confession room, and even a supervisor, it is difficult to see the sacred room - the last one is opened by three middle-aged priests with their respective keys) But they didn't say even one word, they didn't cast a superfluous glimpse, and they didn't hesitate and resist.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light in the holy room is not so full, The air is dry and cold, in order to protect the devout believers who have spent a lot of time and money collecting treasures from all over the place, the oxygen content is very low, and the sacred objects inside are diverse, from a small piece of black leaves and white Miserable bones (Sasha recognizes that An unidentified liquid in a small glass bottle, a gold crown inlaid with a gemstone, has everything.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inside of the sacred room There is a small door with a variety of books and documents, which contain less oxygen.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha carefully walked a small circle and then stopped in front of a few old-fashioned calf vellum papers. If he is not mistaken, this written in Italian, the faintly written document is not complete, part of it is said to be treasured in the secret archives of the Vatican - the personal letter of Pope Innocent III, then he also It’s just a bishop, but his ambitions can be seen with confidence. The scholars and priests who were allowed to enter the secret archives translated it. “If the king can’t serve the agent of Christ sincerely, he can’t properly govern him. The country.", "The king has physical rights, the priests have spiritual rights, and because the spirit rules the flesh, the pope should also be higher than the king."...etc. These sentences prove that Innocent III was in the thirteenth century. The proposed "Sun and Moon" was revealed at the end of the 12th century. There are collectors who offer astronomical rewards to pursue other parts, and it is placed here, on a shelf, at your fingertips, without a solid steel wall or a layered alarm system. The three keys are not so much. It is better to say that it is a kind of ritual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A blunt-faced silver knife is placed next to it, so that people don’t use their fingers to deface or hurt when they read it. Unusually fragile burdock paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha carefully cut the paper with a silver knife. His gestures are subtle and elegant, and there is almost no breathing. He carefully reads and remembers, and engraves what the eyes see into the brain—the father will like this little gift, he thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they walked out of the sacred room, even if they were abilities, Sasha felt a little dizzy, he took a deep breath and the machine smoked from the outside. Fresh air entering the church interior floods into the lungs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have spent a lot of time in other places before, and the light in the corridor is not enough to make people see the texture of the ground under their feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let me send you out." The priest said, "If you are willing to come again..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I am willing to come again," Sasha said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That would remember my name." The priest said that he smiled slightly: "I am Hayman. Stronge."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(To be continued)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ps:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
