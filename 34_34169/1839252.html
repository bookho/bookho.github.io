			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter 170 The Las Vegas (7)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air in the casino is fresh Besib knows that every minute, fresh pure oxygen is transported from the ventilation ducts into the almost closed floor – there are no clocks in the casino, and there are no windows that make people aware of the passage of time. There are only artificial light sources and breeze, they have been repeatedly tested by physiology and psychologists to make sure that they are only refreshing, exciting, and happy – that is, the casino owners need them to stay, so they will forget Gambling one after another, unknowingly lost all his property in the scream of excitement and disappointment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now they have not done so," Sasha said: "At least most casinos already know what it means to be 'sweet and fisher'." The staff (referring to the people who exchange chips and drinks at the gambling table) and the bookkeeper, the manager will try to hide them when the guests lose too much, and when they sign too many owes, they will try to remind them or increase them. The amount of alcohol in the wine consciously allowed him to step back from the table and go back to the room to sleep. Twenty years ago, the casino would be happy to see the gamblers who lost at the gambling table swaying out of the door to commit suicide. However, in the increasingly harsh and thoughtful 21st century, such a bad reputation will only urge those who have the right to propose and promote legislation to tilt in the direction that is unfavourable to them. This is directly related to the future of the former, so No amount of money can be expected to make them feel kind, the owners of the casinos become smart, they show a positive taxation attitude, often make a lot of donations to charities, open up but gambling Other rides, buying newspapers and the media as a mouthpiece - bankruptcy and abnormal deaths will be suppressed for the first time, even if it has nothing to do with gambling - the first time you lose money, you will receive To a lucky card, he can get a free steak meal or a show ticket with the card; some don't listen to advice. The unlucky one who insists on running out the last bit of blood at the gambling table will receive an envelope with a fifty-dollar bill and a free ticket so that he can at least go home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To be a gambler, not a gambler." Little Hopkins said: "Their new slogan."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more and more guests in the casino, those who are gambling all night, who have now recharged in the room, and have a dip in the open-air bath, or Guests who have finished playing a round of golf and tennis in the bright sunshine, but those who have enjoyed the free man or woman in the casino have arrived and are ready to do a good job. The cards are like furry grass. The flannel slipped on and slipped. The ivory ball leaps lively in the black and red plaid, and the seat in front of the baccarat screen is filled in and out, and the sound of the singer is endless. Except for the casino guards sitting on the ladder and some of the dealers and dealers who were empty, no one noticed the green eyes and the young boys around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two hard-to-handle little guys said in his heart that he had not received a minor before, but whether it was more than Sangdi or Hopkins. Their performance can be said to be impeccable - they have not tried to bribe or plead for a place where they can "play", even if the previous red hair Judas has given hints, and not because they can not participate in any of them. An activity that showed an enthusiasm, a listless look, and even a very supportive - he explained that he was really stupid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We still have to find some usefulness for these chips." He took them through the casino, and the magnificent direct elevator took them to the eighth floor, one of the largest amusement parks in Las Vegas. What needs to be specifically stated is that. Most of the game projects here can be consumed directly with chips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bebeb stopped in front of a doll machine and knocked on the glass, "Hey, Sasha." This machine is very close to the Mac below. similar. The surface is painted with heroes from all kinds of cartoons, and the corners are decorated with lanterns. About 20 inches from the ground, there is a coin slot, 5 yuan once, the top is the joystick, the top is a display frame surrounded by three glasses, different from the ordinary doll machine, the row of rows sitting in the white display rack On the top, it is not a plush toy, nor a Barbie doll, but a mobile phone with a value ranging from 600 yuan to 800 yuan. "How much do you think is likely?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Very low." Sasha said: "But there will always be people willing to give it a try."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The right thing to say." The boy who is about the same size is in front of a machine, a boy is throwing chips, and the machine plays the music with rhythm (like the theme song of a science fiction series). The boy’s face is very tight. The cheeks were flushed and sweat was hanging on the tip of the nose. He rubbed his hand on the placket and grabbed the joystick. Left, right, down, well, caught, the grip slowly rose and moved toward the exit, boy Staring at it intently - the hand stopped, and the thing it caught was a slight Shaking, the boys made a deafening shout together: "Right! Right! To the right!" While waving their fists, they grabbed their hands and let go, the beautifully wrapped, smooth-looking prize fell straight. It first hit the edge of the exit, then played a bullet, skewed to the left, not the right side fell, the boys lamented, and the boy who put in the chip was angrily knocking on the transparent glass, as if The entrance and exit of the prizes that are close at hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The music of the machine stopped, the boys whispered, and another boy took a hundred-dollar red chip from his pocket. They were less than three feet away and they ran over and exchanged it for twenty black chips. It is worth mentioning that two of the boys are still in the same place, guarding the machine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Exactly the same." Besib said. They are still children, but their expressions, thoughts, and behaviors are no different from those of gamblers downstairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The seemingly readily available wealth and success is rarely given up." Sasha said that he walked over to the machine, regardless of the two boys’ vigilance. Look, look closely at the things inside, this machine's prize is not a mobile phone, but more rare and precious than a mobile phone - this year's latest, thinnest, lightest, most functional handheld, he and Besib There is such a piece in the suitcase, which was sent by Beppe, and the price is about 4,000 yuan. Its box is plexiglass, rounded at four corners, and the surface is smooth and sturdy - the gripper has not left a trace of trace on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s easier to grab an eaves with an empty hand." Besib said that his voice is lower than the whisper in general. A heavy head rested on the shoulders of Little Hopkins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who knows," Sasha said carelessly: "Lucky may be born in the next second." He raised a hand and grabbed it. I lived in Besib’s ear and pulled him away: “The most important thing in Las Vegas is the miracle.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boys are back, don’t Sib and Sasha step back and let the position go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This kind of catching doll machine is really worthy of its name." Its highest prize even surpassed a Jack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But according to Las Vegas law, it is a doll machine." Say: "You don't want to try? In..." He is a little Depressed the voice: "After two Jacks in a row?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I feel that my luck is not enough to deal with an eDonkey," Besib Say: "You don't have a real doll machine here?" Old Andriana has a small hobby. She likes all kinds of plush toys and dolls, so almost every young person who "goes out to work" will When she returned to Poseidon Island, she brought her one or two pieces and piled up a room. She gave each doll a name, but because of the last explosion and fire, they did not have to leave the old house. It turned into ashes, and Besib had bought her two teddy bears and a Barbie with a crown in Grande, but that was obviously not enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course." Throw the chip bag in his hand and the chips creak in the bag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took Besib and Sasha around a small circle, and several pink doll machines stood quietly under the colorful lights. The prizes inside were really Barbie dolls and teddy bears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you think that is better?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The one standing at the top, black veil Sasha showed a bit of a strange smile: "Look at your luck, dear Besib, if you can catch it, Old Adriana will be very happy to receive this gift."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, okay." In fact, Besib felt that Barbie, the wine red evening dress, was more lovely, but many painful experiences in the past told him to believe in Sasha. Hopkins is good, anyway, he doesn't want to see Old Andriana think he is being mischievous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put a chip for Besib and then retreat to wait. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doll standing at the highest point seems to be the most difficult to catch. Besib has good eyesight and control that ordinary people can hardly match, or it has been lost several times. In the eighth time, he manipulated the grip and hit the doll. Then he grabbed her hair with the grip on the twelfth time. Barbie swayed and approached the exit... Finally, it was regrettable. Dropped into the gap between the exit and the glass cabinet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where it falls, it’s almost impossible to come out, unless Besib is willing to use it for a Barbie, for example, turning his fingers into noodles Stretching into the doll machine... Besib thinks that he is not too naive to this point, it’s ridiculous - just a doll, he can go to the store street to buy a dozen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Besib announced his abandonment, he was keenly aware that he was relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said what happened to him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing," Sasha gently Smiling and said: "He is just a little nervous, anyway, you almost caught 550,000 yuan."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I am not mistaken, it is only the brainchild of Mattel and designer uri - the necklace she wore on her neck, um, that's real. A diamond necklace, a one-carat pink diamond, and a number of white square diamonds, taken two years ago, worth $550,000."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
