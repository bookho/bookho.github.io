			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shawn Battier is a well-dressed, beautiful man, this traditional casino has never changed since the dealership, from the dealer to the dealer, from The manager to the deputy, together with the owner of the casino, their looks and body are better than ordinary men. Of course, the sober mind and the cold heart are also - according to Hopkins, Battier is already in Las Vegas After a full 40 years, he was originally a homeless little sister, living in the sewer, drilling under the table, searching for coins that the gamblers accidentally dropped (at the time there was no This is the story of the chip.) When he grows up, he is a sweetheart or a lovable face with a sweet mouth and a lovable face. He is responsible for seeing a door, making a coat, and making tea. Or coffee, is to send a message to their favorite guests or to send a warning letter or something; after Shawn Battier’s lips have a beard, he could have become a bartender, this is an enviable job. , safe, easy, clean, and a lot of pretty girls, but The rumor declined, and he recommended himself to the owner of the third-ranked casino, Mao, who thought he would be a good bookmaker—when the boy who was about the same size was busy with snores, stealing drinks and licking women’s skirts, Sean. But Battier has been concentrating on observing every gamble as far as he can. He knows how to observe and learn, not only from the banker but also from the gambler, he greedily absorbs poker, scorpion, and roulette. Nutrition, like being fed by them - the casino owner generously gave him a chance, he caught, he has technology and luck, he may be the youngest deputy or even the owner of the casino, but he met Anthony Hopkins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the "Ghoul" at that time was also very young, young and willing to try everything that might be tried, and they worked together. And soon tasted the sweetness, Hopkins got his tuition, and Shawn saved his life and position. Shane Battier sent a letter and a gift to the medical students every Christmas. He never gave up persuading Hopkins to work with him. The gift will always be a chip - five yuan of pure black. Chips, 20 yuan pure green chips, 50 yuan pure yellow enamel chips, 100 yuan pure red chips, 200 yuan pure purple chips, Wu Yiyuan's milky white gold-plated chips... until Anthony Huo Pukins began his first escape under the FBI's pursuit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shawn Battier let go of Hopkins. Turning to the boys, he stood underneath the only chandelier in the room, and the orange-yellow light illuminates the casino owner's face with a layer of gold. He has a broad flat forehead, a raised brow and a pair of honey-colored eyes. His nose is a little narrow, but the tip of his nose is very round, which makes people want to kiss and kiss (many women do the same). The light brown hair with an abnormal color similar to that of white coffee is elegantly rolled, and the beard, the broken hair of the eyes and the forehead are cleaned up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So," he stared at the two boys and reached out. "Two gentlemen. Hopkins... and more than Sangdi." He shook hands with them in turn, his hands were thick and dry, and his strength It is gentle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe you haven't seen me." He looked down at Sasha Hopkins and was amazed at the boy's almost unattainable beauty: "But I am indeed an old friend of your father. We communicated with each other for 12 years. Your father is my mentor and friend. He gave me a lot of great advice," he told the children to look at the screen. This display wall shows the most lively and gorgeous part of the casino - the "player" Mac, lined up, orderly, shiny, thousands of slot machines rotate, stop, fall out When the chips are on the top of the machine, the clang sounds like a coin tide. They are almost in front of each machine. There are people, women and men, and their facial expressions are extremely uniform, numb and nervous. Keep pulling the pole and throwing small plastic pieces, all the movements are mechanical, over and over again, without hesitation, as if they are not throwing the chips that have been earned by the hard earned banknotes, but What else is disgusting and dirty, something that needs to be abandoned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Every casino has a slot machine," Sean said. "But only I have the best business here. Guess what this is - Sasha Thanks to your father, he gave me advice, there are 1,200 singer-player Macs, which are divided into six parts, each connected by a computer, at some point, They will become one--that is, once they are pulled, the coins they spit out will be more than just a machine, but two hundred machines squirting out together, can you imagine? It’s spectacular. The scene."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is anyone really winning?" Besib licked his fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, a young man, he won the corner with a ten-ton truck, his palm prints are placed at the entrance of Apple Airport, look, Look here," one lens zoomed in, and there was a workmanship display on the display with a silver palm on it. The lines, nails and hair on the palm were clearly visible, and lifelike. "The real palm is made by the mold. Platinum is plated in sterling silver. Many people are willing to touch or give him a kiss,” Sean Battier directed the camera to the other side, just above the palm of the hand, hanging a large colored display Over and over, a pile of coins rushed out and pushed the person in front of the machine to the ground. There was an identical vacant display stand on the side, quietly waiting for the arrival of the second lucky one: “Everyone wants to be the second. Is it,?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His deputy bowed half-heartedly: "Yes, everyone wants to be the second one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bessib is doing it in his heart Calculations - Double bet ticks are 1.4%, 21 points are 1%, and roulette taps are 5.5%. Eat slot machines 15 to 20 percent. One hundred and two hundred machines, open 24 hours a day - he also found that these machines are more frequent than regular slot machines (though not very obvious), they give results two to three seconds in advance, gamblers cast The frequency of coins has also increased, and most of them are progressive machines (that is, the more coins are invested, the higher the chance of winning the prize). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can't other casinos do this?" Sasha asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," this time, Besib: "Lucky kids have every casino, but 1,200 computer-controlled machines may not And it’s dangerous to set up this giant pot – there’s a desperate man trying to get it right. If it’s really pulled or is considered to be really pulling, the casino will face a dilemma. Situation - Losing a lot of money or discrediting, not that the casino is willing to lose its reputation, then only pay, but if that, the casino owner will be regarded as a loser by shareholders, he will lose control of the casino The right, this is very dangerous."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before Battier, no one dared to do that. After Battier, they felt that they lost the opportunity. Dr. Hopkins said in a soft tone that we are used to: "And the risk is really big, Battier. Do you think I should try it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shawn Battier makes an exaggerated expression of fear, then with Hope Dr. Kings laughed together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, there are many good ideas that your father gives." Sean Battier squinted mysteriously: "But I suggest you Go and see it, feel it, how?” He asked Dr. Hopkins, the doctor nodded to Sasha and Besib: “Go,” he said. “It’s fun.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"." Battier shouted. The deputy immediately stepped forward: "Take our young guests down, walk, see, play, or whatever... whatever they want, as long as they want and want. I hope that every request they make can be Satisfied," he paused and walked back to his desk. Pulling the drawer open, and taking out two rolls of kraft paper wrapped in chips, they are all milky white with gold rims. He gives two children one roll. "Additionally. They can pay and the bill is sent to me." /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think I have to say it again." The deputy went to the front of the two boys, the olive-green eyes flashed under the light, and the luster was fascinating: "You can call me, they call me, or green eyes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have been worried about you, my dear friend," Sean Bar Tyre said, "You could have come to me first. Do you think that I will watch an old friend suffer from grievances and stand by? I also have a lawyer and a door. I still have a director and governor in my villa. My dear. The doctor wants to get rid of those annoying prosecutors, agents and half a year. The result is that you disappear so inexplicably, no phone calls, no letters, although I still I can receive your birthday present, but I can't find you," Battier clung to Anthony Hopkins's shoulder and guided him to sit down on the sofa, sighing with indignation and grievances. "I didn't even get to your wedding, I haven't seen your wife, and Son, I thought I could be his godfather."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My wife has passed away," said Dr. Hopkins: "Sasha The godfather has another person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please don't say that you have never considered me," said Battier, sadly saying, "I will be so sad." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins looked at him as quietly as watching a naughty child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shawn Battier’s smile disappeared, he lifted his shoulder and took a bottle of wine from the small bar hidden behind the sofa: “Old Overhold's rye whiskey, without water." Amber liquid dangling in the cup, he and Hopkins have a cup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have encountered a difficult thing." Battier said: "Hopkins, I need your help." He said, press the remote control The velvet canopy on the ceiling slowly opened, and the ground was trembling. The black bright floor gradually lit up, and all the unique and regular noises in the casino came from all directions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now they are like being in a scorpion, the six inner faces of the scorpion are covered with a uniform display. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(To be continued)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
