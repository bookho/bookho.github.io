			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter 86 aging (3)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lilithe Meyer licking her lips and turning Look at Hefner, look at Bonnie, look at Cassie, even the two guards who stepped back into the corner, and finally stared at Hopkins, small, and big - eyes The child was sullen and complaining. She was accusing them. They deceived her, mocked her, hurt her, and turned a blind eye to everything she had suffered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, except for the two guards (they left their eyes indifferently), Lilith Mel’s blue eyes shot The angry eyes that were difficult to calm down failed to gain the attention of others. After a moment of silence, they acted on their own feet. Big Hopkins crossed her front and walked to the sofa to pick up Little Hope. Kings, briefly moved to Hefner and the person next to him, and quickly nodded and walked into the bedroom. Bonnie turned and lifted the phone that was thrown under the coffee table during the assault, notifying the cleaning below. The most embarrassing thing for the staff to clean and organize the room is that Hefner invited Cassie to the third floor. Everyone knows that this is a sinister/swinging, full of meat/sexual carnival. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can you?" Lilith's lips trembled frantically, and she couldn't believe it: "How can you!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why can't I," Hefner calmly retorted: "You insist on keeping your chastity before the wedding night, I understand and support, um, this is my hope." But you can't force me to fulfill the same obligations. We don't have this one in our prenuptial agreement. You should have known that I can't live without a woman. I can't do it one day. I can't do it one night. I can't do it for a moment. If you don't want to see me and anything else. Women are together, so dear, would you like to share my bedroom and bed with me? Of course, I mean, now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He waited slightly For a while, without waiting for an echo or any expression, Hefner opened his lips and revealed his sharp teeth: "Very wise, Lilith my little baby, treasure it, this is your greatest wealth."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This direct and dramatic humiliation is something that can make any A strong-willed woman collapses or faints, which is worthy of our praise. Lilith Mayer insisted, and she gasped heavily and closed her eyes to avoid watching her fiance and another shameless squat The doorway, the stairs, and the bedroom—if it was just because of her anger that others would not dare to approach it, now it’s because of the sorrow and pain she has suppressed – the guards sympathetically watched Lilithmeer alone. The man swayed through the room, five minutes before, the woman thought she was the queen here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think she wants to say something to us." Sasha said, the voice was a bit confusing, and his front teeth had not grown. A few hours ago, I lost another one, which is the first fang. I don't know why, he changed his teeth later than other children, the order was chaotic, and it was too frequent. Inevitably, this caused a persistent low-grade fever. So in the past few weeks, he was always a little embarrassed and didn't like to eat. Not so much love to talk, even the favorite reading has changed from a few hours a day to an intermittent number of minutes - more than this time he will dizzy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big Hopkins's lips reached the child's forehead, and the cold, Sasha sighed happily. To find out why, Dr. Hopkins thought that the body between his arms was soft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But she still didn't say anything after all." He rubbed his soft hair with his forehead: "Is it?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lilithe Meyer returned to his room, second floor, slightly larger, luxurious, comfortable Point, but whether it is the internal layout or the floor is the same as other girls, she knows that this is the warning of Gucci Hefner, lest she be overwhelmed by the future title of Mrs. Hefner, but he is in vain, Lilithie I know exactly what I want and what I want to get, she can, she is qualified... yes, maybe not now, but after she is married, she will be able to share all of Hefner, not just the bed, he Wealth, power, status, every and every must have her traces inside, she laughed at the mirror, she knows this man very well, he is cruel and selfish, but also pays attention to tradition, based on He will definitely give his wife a face, especially in front of outsiders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If they are married, then her request will not be rejected today - a niece/female, and a wife, his children, the sea The mother of the heirs of the Kingdom of Fna, Hefner scored a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you saying that you are a little too anxious? Lilith opened the refrigerator angrily, poured herself a whiskey, ordered a cigarette, and enjoyed it in a few minutes. Then she pulled out a new cigarette and lit it with the tail of the front. She also wanted Drinking, but this time without a cup, she took out the bottle directly. Whiskey with a strong smoky flavor, this kind of scotch whisky, which has been distilled from malt and is brewed for at least three years in a wooden barrel (this is written in local law), is expensive. A few years ago she didn't dare to drink this – not only because of the relationship of money, but everyone knows that cigarettes and wine are awl, they drill holes in your body so that youth and health can flow out of those holes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cigarettes are also very good, even with the wine, they play a role together, Lilith soon feels swaying, everything is magnified, and Muir shrinks. Her body floated in the air and stepped on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body is hot, Lilith holds her throat, she pulls her hair, then zipper and button, silk dress from her body She slipped on and she didn't wear it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gucci Hefner is a jerk, but he is not wrong, today's body is Lilith Mayer's greatest fortune - he looks down on her, but he can't refuse The temptation, this body, full and pure body is as attractive to him as the honey that attracts the bear. In any case, he will marry her, and she will have children and share everything - Lilith is fascinated Turning around in front of the mirror, she caress herself from top to bottom, and she can't help but laugh and laugh. Her mother said that every part of her small onion is made by God's carefully selected fine materials. Every inch, she opened her mouth and spit out a rosy tongue in the mirror. Every place, from the chest to the butt, was perfect. "Little cute, cute," she said to herself, all the fatigue, loss and grievances. Wings fly, leaving only endless pride and brilliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Only you can make up for his shortcomings." She whispered in the mirror: "Only you, no one else, no."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This evening, Lilith Smer, as always, took Hefner’s arm and appeared in the club’s venue. In the meantime, although it was short-lived - almost only allowed people to kill a cigar, she disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is a little uncomfortable." Hefner said: "Don't mind."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guest Of course, we don't mind. There are still bunny girls here. Most importantly, Hefner will not marry any of them. For a while, you can freely invite one of them. A good time together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lilysmel turned his head before leaving the hall and looked at it. According to the old rules, Hefner lazily leaned against the red velvet chair in the shape of a lip. On the top, several bunny girls occupy the position beside him. The closest thing to him is Cassie. Obviously, the excellent "service" of the first two hours made her win the favor of Hefner. She sat on the arm of the sofa. Supporting Hefner's head with his thighs, holding his mouth constantly, stupid like a clown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her makeup is a bit thick, especially powder, too much, Lilith suspects that if she gives her a slap, will she feel pain, or a concussion, like those who are covered in a fully enclosed gas mask - - She is still able to show a smile, it is really rare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she got married with Hefner, she might be able to leave Cassie and put her whole body on the toilet for decoration? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Betty, this restless little wife, sitting cross-legged in front of the sofa, holding a lowered arm of Hefner, hard Bring it in your arms, hate you can't put it in your body, innocent smile, like an eight-year-old girl holding her doll. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lilith took a deep breath, and one day, the fire of hell would burn on them, don’t worry, she really wants to determine the goal. Didn't find it... Well, she found it. He is standing in the middle of a group of well-dressed gentlemen. Although from Lilysmeyer's point of view, she can only see those surprised and revered eyes and the bare-eyed, like a heron bird. The back of the back is so gray and neat, but it is true that Anthony Hopkins is right, it seems that their conversation is in good condition, that is, at least half an hour, Hopkins will stay in this venue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a skillful old cat, Lilith Mayer quietly walked up the stairs, the second floor, the end, the largest suite, too The only room inhabited by a man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha Hopkins opens his eyes in the dark, room Quietly, but he heard two breaths, one is his own, and the other...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lily Smel?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes." Lilith took two steps before going to bed, and now she is only two steps away from Sasha. "I need help, yours, and your father."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sashaan lay quietly on the bed, both hands outside the blanket, eyes Closed, as if still sleeping, but Lilith heard his voice: "I don't know how to help you." He whispered indifferently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The ungrateful mixed ball," Lilith whispered. "I found you, I let Hefner hire and shelter you, if not I, where are you now?? Slums? Or the institution's Babel Tower?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
