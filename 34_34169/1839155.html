			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look," a tourist pointed out in amazement and shouted: "What a dog!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The small half of the New York City’s domestic dogs should climb from their kennels or rooms with the call of human beings, which they can’t ignore. Wet grass, woods, streets, and the direction of the pier unobtrusively, they gather on the anti-wave lift of the cement, a group of underground water; the wind is very big, but the dogs are cleverly integrated with the regiment, the big dog Such as Great Dane, Great White Bear, Scottish Shepherd or Blood Dog and St. Bernard in front and outer, medium size dogs, Samoyed, Bellington, Husky, etc. will be smaller The puppies are in the middle, or biting the skin of their ears or neck, they lean against each other, helping each other through a block of continuous, huge sea walls, until the four claws are stepped on the land to disperse open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nearly one-fifth of the shit died in the ferocious sea, but the number of dogs that eventually climbed on Kamala Island exceeded 400. Only, most of them are large dogs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are nervous, tired but fierce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like staring at the person in charge of swat and the people around him... a few, a few, they are almost as jealous as humans, knowing to observe, Measuring, coordinating, collaborating, and acting quickly, when jumping and jumping in the gray rain, it is like a shadow or a ghost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His dagger was accurately inserted into the mouth of the Great White Poodle, and the sharp teeth cut open the part of the palm that was not covered by the glove, and in his pull Before the dagger, a black Labrador jumped up and bit his arm. The hot pain caused his fingers to loosen subconsciously. The dog hangs on his arm and shakes his body from side to side. A hind paw was waving in the air, and finally stepped on his belt. The man screamed lowly. He lifted the free hand and groped along the hind leg, grabbing the dog* *and **, he pulled them awkwardly. This time it was the turn of the animals that screamed. It loosened the teeth. The human hand grasped the injured hand and found it still powerful. Labrador The dog belongs to the medium and large dogs. After the teeth penetrated the diving suit of six millimeters thickness, they encountered a five-millimeter-thick winter jacket. The final embedding of the body was only a little bit - although the pain caused by the wound did have a little impact. But at least it can be used. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person in charge heard the growl, and he pulled out the gun, lowered his body slightly, and moved his footsteps—a soft thing wrapped around his ankle, and he was stumped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a slender dachshund, and it screamed sadly, jumping from the head of the responsible person and fleeing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rain poured into his nose, mouth and eyes, the gun slipped out of his hand, he gasped and wanted to get up, suddenly, the rain was Covered, hot, thick, blocking it - a big dog never seen before, pulled out from behind the rain, it bite the arm that had been hurt once - the original The goal is his throat, the person in charge is trying to reapply, but the dog is too big, his fist can only reach its waist, it is full of strong muscles, and the power of human beings does not pose any threat to it. It swayed his head in madness, and the teeth were deeper and deeper, as if the arm was completely removed from the human body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this very little time, the other two dogs snorted silently, one biting his finger in the mud, groping his gun, The other one began to bite his face. They are all puppies, but they are not inferior to big dogs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is too stupid, the person in charge thinks, was killed by a dog on a raised island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After struggling, one of his subordinates saw that he was rolling over a dog’s neck, and it looked much better than him, but he was expected to help him. ... oh... I am afraid it will be a bit late. Another possible helper didn't know where to go. He could hear his curse a few seconds ago, but now he can only hear the sound of chaos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dog's mouth spurted him into a stench. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With one hand stretched over, he held down the head that was preparing a big piece of cockroach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The violent animal fell without warning and rebellion, and there was a weapon in the hands of the empty space - only one finger The mini pistol, like the ornament hanging on the key ring, the fingers bent, the nails gently pull the trigger, the tiny bullets flew out from the barrel of the inner diameter of less than a cigarette width, it passed through the air The rain and the dog's eyes, the dog's teeth clenched in the last sputum, and then relaxed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person in charge waved back to the free arm, stuck the neck of the big dog still biting his other hand, his index finger and thumb touched Go to its trachea, squeeze it hard, and try to squeeze all the oxygen stored in it. He resisted the pain and stabbed for nearly a minute. The big dog's upper and lower jaws were loosened and his body softened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He whispered cursing his arm back from the dog's teeth. It was already bloody and full of stinky saliva. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The savior turned to another devil with a long tail, and two large Rottweilers rushed up, falling in contact with him. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abel flipped his wrist, the accumulated vitality flowed between his fingers, the black pistol - the normal size Walter formed in the rain, he turned Not far from the shadow of the virtual image of the gun opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bullet penetrated a dog’s neck and then embedded in the chest of another dog. It was shot and flew out, making a miserable roar in the air. The louder one is the gunshot, which is deafening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dogs hidden in the rain are screaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ealf members in the restaurant jumped involuntarily and they grabbed the weapon The face is serious and the body is tight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somitre is still sitting in his old position, his face is pale, and his red teeth are white with his teeth: "Nothing." Nervous, they can't get through," he whispered, turning his eyes to the door. The door of the restaurant was glass. They didn't want people to see the situation directly. The radical animal protectionists painted it with spray cans. The slogan and the picture, a letter o flashed a small tail, "Our allies have come," he said happily: "and immediately came in handy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few children who were brought into the restaurant half an hour ago and Mrs. Bolu looked around in horror. There were many floor-to-ceiling windows in the restaurant, and the black and white nose flashed from time to time. With furry ears, occasionally you can see your teeth and tongue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high and low squeaks have not stopped since the beginning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jamie, with two people," Somitre said: "Bring the Kason State and the teacher out, prepare the camera, kill them, I think our previous warnings are not thorough enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jami, who is serving the Chihuahua, is raising his head and he will eat the puppy in the future. The half of the mustard sausage was stuffed into his mouth, licking the oil on his clothes, and made a funny gift to Somitre, and walked out with a swing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Street has his fingers, neck and ankles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly looked up: "Have you heard anything?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The dog is calling One of the workers simply replied that his companion was leaning on his shoulder, cold and hungry, and the damp and cool stone floor was not a good place to rest, even with a blanket, a chill Keep looking around the body and bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghoul’s ear can hear a lot of sounds that humans can’t hear, including a dog whistle with a frequency of 120 Hz, which was from a few hours ago. He blew the thing, and now he is still blowing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the screams of the past, the number of dogs is quite impressive, and Streif quickly made a comparison, Somitre appeared in The time here is not long, "busy justice messenger." He muttered to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door of the cellar was opened again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing was the violent wind and rain, and then they were a little smaller because someone stood at the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have been released." Jamie said, "Kai Shengguo and Streif, come out."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Kai Shengguo may not be able to move." Streif said: "He was injured."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You hold him. Jamie said that he was a little impatient. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stevelev grabbed the arm of Kaishengguo and put it on his shoulder, holding the hand of Kaishengguo from the back of his shoulder in his left hand, right hand Take his waist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They walked slowly out of the cellar, the cellar was built between the dormitory and the tool room, starting from the exit, the walkway with a ten foot was very narrow, an adult Men can touch the walls on both sides with their elbows on their sides, and the smooth road has a very slight inclination - in order to facilitate the heavy squid box in and out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jami looked at them with vigilance. The obese body clung to the wall. He held a 0.45-inch hunting pistol from Wildey, and the barrel was a bit long. The two people behind him shrugged their shoulders and armed with weapons - Streiff narrowed his eyes, the rain dripped continuously from his thick eyebrows, and some invaded his eyes, the salt inside irritating the mucous membranes The cornea - a long barrel wrapped in brass, wooden hand, American long rifle? Perhaps this is also a favorite hunting gun, and Streif is familiar with them, although he often uses bows and the prey to be different from ordinary people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Streif helped the Kason State pass by him, the three people were almost crowded together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kai Shengguo’s feet suddenly collapsed together, he fell forward, his body slipped from Streif’s body, and Streiff’s side turned The body, hands hanging down, as if to help him, a steel ice cone fell from the hanging sleeve to the powerful fingers, it was found by Strath from the ice, looks more like an oversized Nails, the workers hammered it with a hammer and used it to break through the whole block of ice – he held the blunt head and made a sudden effort in a tiny space – this is the ghoul’s masterpiece, he The muscles are tight, like the wire on the bow, hehe! The ice cone ejected and penetrated into the middle of the abdominal cavity of Jamie, that is, the twelfth thoracic vertebrae to the first lumbar vertebrae, where the solar nerve plexus was distributed. This pain can be mad, and Jamie could not call it. The sound, his abdomen with his chest muscles groaning, he couldn't stand up, he also got an unstable gun, and his eyes were black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steffef calmly picked up his gun and killed the other two - they were rushing with the weapons in their hands - this The guns need to go back and pull back to get on the rifle, they don't even have time to pull the trigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kai Shengguo held his knees and struggled to get up from the rain. The villain who once beaten him was lying less than a foot away from him. It hurts, and the chest is bleeding. He is dying, and his other two companions are dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am going to find my son, Mr. Kai Shengguo," said Streif, politely, "I think you can look after yourself?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jamie bent his body and lay in the rain. He wanted to stand up more than once, but he couldn’t succeed, it hurts too much, and it hurts enough. People give up everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t have a person around him. Kaisheng went back to the land. He didn’t kill him, but he didn’t save him. His blood flow continued. Then, in a blink of an eye, it was washed away by the rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jamie wants to read a prayer for himself, but he doesn’t remember too much, including the Thanksgiving prayer before dinner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A small black thing turned out from the corner, it was close to him, sobbing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
