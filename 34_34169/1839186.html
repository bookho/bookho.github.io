They don’t look like fins or eyes, and careless people can’t even find them. mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two sharp fish." The girl cried with delight, she climbed on the hot ship's side, and then unwittingly put the whole head into the warmth. In the sea, in order to be able to observe the rare creatures in further detail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two minutes later she fished herself out with satisfaction, originally with a small roll, fluffy linen hair sticking tightly on her face She sat back on the warm board and pulled the part that covered her eyes and nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A towel that is dry to the hard state falls on the girl’s head, it absorbs the water quickly, then pulls it down softly, and the girl grabs the ends of the towel Raise your face: "Thank you, swear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The people here call them sea spears." John said, "but they can't count as Fish, although they look very similar to fish or worms, in fact, their lineage is far from the latter two. Correctly speaking, they are between invertebrates and vertebrae. Chordates - even if they have a visual device, have a mouth, have a split, have a caudal fin and an anal fin, and have a back fold on the back, the biggest problem is, "The burly man screamed at his beloved daughter." The eyes, pointing to their heads: "There is no real head and brain. There is no feeling, no memory, no desire, they will not take the initiative to prey - so, dear, it can not be counted as a fish, its rank Not so high. Although people have always called it." He grabbed the bath towel Taking over the following activities, the girl's hair is thin and dense, and the knots are terrible. "They are very picky about water quality and temperature. Such a dense scene can only be seen on a few islands."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Private island." The girl said slyly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is precisely because of this," John said with tolerance: "They are best protected." Human greed is almost endless, the only possibility The only way to make them less urgent is to divide what they share and put them under private belly in various ways. Ironically, they will watch their own "things" as the dragon guards the treasure, and spurt angry flames at every person and thing that attempts to smother or destroy them - even if they are a minute ago Still in the same queue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Environmentalists are not happy that the uninhabited original ecological islands become the capsules of some people. The non-resident islands are a closed and small ecological environment unit with relative ecosystems. This ecosystem is extremely fragile, vulnerable to damage, and difficult to recover after destruction – no matter how open and generous its new owner is – as long as modern humans can live on it, it means that the island’s original environment may already It has been damaged by only a hundred years and thousands of years. This is not a piece of renewable energy (wind, solar, ocean energy) and rainwater harvesting, desalination, sewage recycling and other technologies can be easily offset - - For environmentalists, the best way to deal with it is to stay away from forgetting... no use, no development, no tour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but they also have to admit that the islands that have not been fortunate enough to receive private shelter have suffered worse than the above: first, the beach and the woods. - If they do, visitors of all kinds will come in. In order to meet their needs, the beach will build a dock, which may cause the reefs of ships and humans to be destroyed; some trees are pushed down, they are A beautiful white hotel will be built on the cemetery. The cable from the mainland will be connected to the depths of the island so that children can eat ice cream and access the Internet anytime and anywhere. The wide and delicate beach is day after day. Set up mushroom-like umbrellas and small tents, hordes of humans enjoy their rare leisure moments here, drinking, dancing, swimming, bonfire barbecue in the evening, and harassing, capturing or eating all the creatures... ...insects, small beasts, fish, seabirds, shells, corals and even sand bugs. A few days later, they happily returned, leaving empty mountains of beer cans, food bags and scattered plastic slippers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a good day can’t last long, and in a few years, people can only look for photos and remember the beauty they once had. As a result, the remaining vegetation was further destroyed, the sea sand was transported away as a building material, the shallow sea area was filled, thousands of tons of cement smoothed the rugged coral reefs, and the gray-white warehouse was built. The cargo ship, which always dragged the dirty oil, followed the dock to the dock, and the sea water around it was filthy and dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be used for a while, but who can't predict the length of the time, the life of the dock and warehouse is closely related to the route, the route of the large passenger freighter It may be a rare change in a hundred years. It is hard to say like these boats. Some routes may only undergo a big change because of the sudden excitement of several pirates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last thing people get is just a big chunk of cement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Poseidon Island is not a private island.” The young people who stood steadily around them suddenly interjected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John was a little surprised - on this ship except John Carson and his daughter, and four colleagues and friends with him. It is only the local residents of Poseidon Island. This is Tang’s request. Chegale allows a scholar with a good reputation in all aspects to do some research and investigation with his children and assistants, but only if he can’t cross the road. Invisible, but clearly marked the warning line of "dangerous" and "death" - "Tang said that he could not let his friends and children be hurt because of his temporary generosity." The middleman recounted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They can understand and speak lingua franca, but if they are not necessary, these people are almost dumb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But it has a king," the girl said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John immediately tightened his arm and hugged her little shoulders: "Sorry." He looked nervously at the dark, muscular skin. Young man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no king in Poseidon Island." The young man said slowly, as he packed up the cable, and carefully observed the father and daughter, like It is to engrave their every move on the retina. "But if you must find such a leader, then there is only 'Tang' Chegal, but we generally call him a good person, he is indeed a good person, we respect him, and hope that others can respect him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John smiled reluctantly: "Yes," he replied calmly. "I have no reason not to respect Mr. Sandy, he gave us a hard time. The opportunity and great convenience." He shook his daughter: "Is it right, Chiz?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chiz made a face, then really place Nodded. She is in the middle stage between girls and girls. Her eyes and smile are pure like fresh peas. When she stands in front of you, you can feel that youth and anger are just like the sun and the wind. This kind of charm that can almost make everyone intoxicated has played a certain role, the young man's face is no longer so tight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John waited a little for a moment: "Maybe you can ask," he asked softly. "How long will it take us to reach the island of Holy Cross?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not far away, Professor, as long as ten minutes, hey, we can already see it." The young crew replied politely,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Thank you, this is really good," John said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crew walked away without saying a word, John turned back and used his nose to top the daughter’s forehead: "Look, we have to be careful, but Don't be too scared."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a marine biologist, a naturalist and a member of an environmental organization with ten years of experience, John Carson is very aware of At some point, the threat from humans may go far beyond the claws and thunder and lightning, but he is confident that he can control the situation. The "Mosayer" that everyone talks about is only one in John's eyes. The huge beast, "it still has rules and habits to ponder," John thought: "And my companions are meticulous and meticulous, we won't irritate it - we won't even be disturbed. Our goal is holy water, not human."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;San Croix Located on the left side of Poseidon Island, it is very small, even when it is at low tide, there will be no more than a dozen people standing on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its name comes from the stand of Christ standing alone in the distance, and the goal of marine biologists is certainly not that, attracting them not far behind. Miles came from the holy water shells below the island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheng Shuibei, 砗磲, or literally translated according to its scientific name "海生巨花蛤", like coral, has the temperature, quality and nutrients of sea water Very high requirements, belonging to the Kurdish island near the sea god island, is the largest of all the mites - and because of the increasingly frequent fishing and pollution of humans, like this still alive, as big as a bathtub and Almost all of the densely populated rare shellfish groups have disappeared, and John Carson learned from a very chance that there is still such a holy place on earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What makes him even more happy is that the ruler of Poseidon, the king of the mob, a dangerous person who can make tens of millions of people tremble in the dark," Tang" Chegal actually agreed to his request. This is the first time in a hundred years that mercenaries and "outsiders" outside have set foot on the ground of Poseidon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few friends were worried about this action. They also persuaded him to leave Chiz, but John Carson felt that it was a pity that he couldn’t see it with his own eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ready?" John shouted: "One, two, three!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The plop, they took the oxygen cylinder, one turned down the boat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is that?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A marine biologist, and his daughter," Besib lazily relaxed his limbs, floating on the sea, and the sea water poured into his ears. He listened to everything. Awkward, but still barely understand: "John Carson. His daughter is called Chiz Carson."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are they doing?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems to be for shells," Besib turned over, plunged into the water, and quickly popped his head. Just like three years ago, he was surrounded by several children of roughly equal age. Of course, there were several children who were unfortunately standing in the wrong team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the use of shells?" The child around him asked unreasonably, his father was one of Chegar's more recently valued thugs, and he I also strive to get the position closest to the future leader. The performance is very strong, and sometimes I feel a little annoyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Madonna knows." Besib said: "Safe and innocent, there must be some hope after living abundance, or else, what else can they do?" He obviously didn't want to continue the topic: "Qiz is a strange name, but I always feel that I have seen or heard it?" He spit out his mouth: "Do you think about it? Sasha?" <<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"," Sasha said that his teeth have been replaced, and now he is troubled by the body, he is growing fast, bones and muscles because of the rapid Growing and continually fainting at night, so when possible, he would choose to immerse the whole body in warm sea water, and the buoyancy and heat provided by the sea water played a good appeasement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He swam to Besib, and the children around Besib immediately let go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
