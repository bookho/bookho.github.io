"But Mr. Kason is a member of Parliament, is it right? There is a dozen agencies willing to help him solve the trouble. Maybe it should include the Bureau and the FBI - is your boyfriend having a fixed occupation? What is the tax situation? He is I don't really like to participate in the kind of stripped clothes and red pigment on the body? Has he cut the wires of the chicken farm, or opened the cages of the laboratory and the zoo? Or is it more outrageous? Maybe not going before Pay attention to the naughty boy, but if A member of parliament, an ex officio member of all committees of the parliament, has the right to present a draft law alone or jointly at the city council, and has the right to attend all important meetings of the city. The respectable member of the parliament has shown extraordinary concern to him. I mean, the negative one, he will find that he is full of holes, and each hole can make him stay in prison for a month, and during this time, he is very likely Being a girl or a sandbag by other inmates is either a sudden illness or something, not a death, but living is more sinful than death." He noticed that Camilla’s face became pale and her eyes began to accumulate fear. "Do you understand? So you came to me - a good old man who is new to your place. You hope that I can go and say to Mr. Kaishengguo, I fell in love with you, and in a pure and normal love. I am engaged in engagement after half a year and get married one year later. Right? You came to me today for this reason, so the attention of Kaisheng will be transferred from your little boyfriend to me." Spread out Hand, he used a small finger instead of bread to wipe and blur the lines of the charcoal, so the edge of the finger became dark, and there was a cockroach on the left hand side: "This way, the lucky little fish can get from the Kaisheng country. The big net escaped - even if you finally find out that he is not in that terrible net, you can escape your father's surveillance and control through my cover. But what is annoying is that I have to get stuck in Mr. Kay’s eyes are underneath, and there is no doubt that when you and your little boyfriend are looking for a living space for a whale in a newspaper, he will pour most of his anger on the dare to unite with his daughter. The deceived person and the stranger who caused great evil."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rosy blush is filled from Kemira’s neck, half is angry, half is Embarrassed, Streiff said that it was completely correct. She was really worried about this thing for more than a year. Syleroff’s various actions, Hillenos, had almost all done it. He was arrested many times. But obviously, he was forced to buckle before his disappearance The number of bets has risen dramatically, and each time they are humiliated and beaten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Do you hate your father?” Streif asked quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kemira looked up and she looked at him in surprise, as if he suddenly became a panda. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you hate it? Because he does things, not just your love - he controls you from the time you are a baby, he I could have thrown you at your mother, give her a sum of money, let her and you fend for themselves, so you might be able to raise a girl like many single mothers - have their own ideals, their own Love, his own life. But his morality does not allow him to do this, he married your mother, but he does not want her, he only wants you, let your surname be his last name, a name belonging to the Chinese, a China Women become your adoptive mother. You grow up like a real Chinese girl under her education. Your bones, blood and muscles are filled with sandalwood and ink sticks. For a while, you think you are a Pure Chinese, and proud and happy for this. But suddenly, he wants you to marry an outsider, because you have an outsider's face, maybe skin and eyes... he is today Did you find this? Did he never Do you have a pair of mossy green eyes, linen hair and white skin?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." Streiff used that kind of confusing The voice continued: "He knows everything, he knows you well, from the body to the heart. But why should he care about this? He has his standards, all things have to follow his standards, otherwise it is wrong ", even sinful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The father is a stubborn person." Kemira said that her voice was very dry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You hate his stubbornness," Streif said. "Without his stubbornness, you will be much happy."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kemira stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am sorry," she said, widening her eyes: "I made this request to you--" her voice suddenly stopped and worked hard. Second, but only a few fuzzy syllables, the red golden sunlight from the window to her body, her eyes flashed bright light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before the tears fell, Kemira left the classroom and Streif did not retain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did she say goodbye? Perhaps, Strathef didn't care about this, he lifted the head that was as smooth as a leeches, and the slender, pale fingers carefully gripped the edge of the cork – like the neck of a snake, he put It lifted up and looked at the light outside the window. There was Kemira's painting on it. When she left, she tried to take it away quietly, but the leather paper was nailed to the cork board. She couldn't take the common cork board. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He heard a small sneeze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steffef immediately put down the things in his hand, stood up, and went to the desk that looked like a stainless steel corpse - look inside - The black calfskin chair was bought from a used-goods auction. The high backrest can be put down and placed in the same level as the seat cushion. It comes with a footrest of the same material. It is a very comfortable and concealed. Small bed. Sasha Streif curled up inside, wrapped in a warm, soft blanket, and a crimson hibiscus tree flower stuck between his lips and his nose, letting him sneeze gently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The child’s eyeballs trembled, his eyes opened, and Streiff saw the beautiful purple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wake up, wake up, wake up quietly, in a pleasant room." Streiff said, he bypassed the table and Sasha squatted down. He checked the child's temperature and found that the low fever caused by the tooth change still did not recede. Then he looked at the teeth of Sasha, neat, small, white deciduous teeth, a anterior incisor. Already lost, and the side incisors and the first molars are also showing signs of looseness. He stopped and thought for a while, trying not to think about the teeth that fell in the white snow and black sludge - the first one When I didn't live to change my teeth, I was dragged out by the squadrons. It was no more difficult to deal with a little deer. The pot was hanging under the beam of the house. The bottom of the pot burned the beautiful frame and the foot of the armchair, snoring, white. Teng Teng, they took her out and ate it, both sweet and sweet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Sasha should be able to live longer, and for a long time, he will be cautious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stralev opened the drawer at the bottom, where there was a portable injection box, and he took the syringe from the inside, the needle was as thin as the hair He gave an injection to Sasha Streif. Strath doesn't trust other doctors, so he doesn't have his own personal doctor. Of course, Sasha can't have it - he wipes and holds the needle eye with a cotton ball, waits for a few seconds, and when it opens, it only has A little pink that can hardly be seen, even a nurse with more than a decade of experience may not be able to do so well. Now he remembers the scene when he injected Catherine. It is from that day that he is sure that Sasha can be in Catherine’s body. Get reborn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Is it Kemma?” Sasha asked in a confused way: “Scorpion flower.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Yes bs, gardenia is the core Scent," Streif said. "It's her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He left the blanket on Sasha, he picked up the child and took it to that Put it up at the desk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha sat on his lap, and Streiff caught his foot across the blanket, like holding a pair of bunny, his other One hand passed under the ribs of Sasha and pressed on the desk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spirit of Sasha is much better than a few minutes ago. He looked through the students' works and then Catherine's paintings aroused his idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a huge library in the memory of Sasha, etc. These are popular in the market and are said to be able to study graphic drawings. The best-selling book on human psychology was kept in a corner, but it did not prevent him from taking photos when necessary - although from the perspective of former Hopkins doctors, these authors and Baltimore violent psychosis The doctor of the hospital is all the way - 'authority and professional', 'omnipotent', is the lack of a formal medical diploma... "I can't say that they are wrong, this may be the habit of bluffing The only thing the guy finds in a big part of the book is what they think they can figure out - but the problem is, if you are willing to get to the bottom, you will find that the things inside are just shit. Sasha remembered that his father had said in the usual contempt: "Smelly smells."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-唔, let us take a look Inside the content, "painting Big, aggressive, small picture, shy and shy, painted in the center of the paper, full of security, painted on the top, very optimistic, painted on the edge... Oh, too bad, you are extremely lacking in confidence; the more powerful the brush The more confident, intermittent, and curved, the more comfortable the author is... The thick trunk symbolizes the vitality of life, the small trunk represents the lack of support in the journey of life, and the fruit of the fall is really bad, you are forced to leave home, and In a very unpleasant situation... Look at how many fruits are lost, this will indicate your age - finished? Sorry no, not yet, we can also look at the scars on the tree, how many scars indicate how much you have Tragic past... This represents unemployment, this represents divorce, and the death of the parents, the child is in prison... Is the puppy crushed by the car? Of course, maybe with the added nail polish and expired Milk."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A group of tricks." Streif set up the painting: "I also brought my little secrets to the bottom - since such books can reach tens of thousands of copies (which is incredible), are those readers? No one will be wary of this? When someone takes out paper and a pen and lets you draw a tree, a house and a person - I never think someone will be happy Tear open your chest and pull out the internal organs for people to visit... Well, let's take a look at this first, it contains a lot of content - the first is the tree, have you seen this painting? There is hardly a straight line that extends from the lower left corner of the paper to the center of the picture, the roots are exposed, the branches are drooping, swinging with the wind, and then the intermittent lines, starting from the bottom of the tree, extend to the other One end, and finally a small thing, look closely, is this a house? Yes, this is a house, a small house, no doors and windows.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp So, if we are willing to follow those books Indications for analysis: the tree at the edge of the picture represents insecure, the exposed roots indicate that the author's mentality is not mature enough, the drooping branches metaphorizes that she still stays in the past, no fruit symbolizes that she is not demanding, no target The intermittent lines indicate that she lacks self-confidence. Too small a house means she is not embarrassed about the family and does not want to communicate with others."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Straef reveals a Full of ridiculous smiles, this smile will make many people violent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But is this true?" He gently licked the cheeks with a small fingertip: "Only half of Kemira’s blood vessels belong to The blood of the Chinese, but the education she received is more pure than many Chinese. Sasha, like her name, uses an obvious but difficult to be seen trick, she learned some of her own Something is applied in the picture, her real thoughts are hidden. So we see the sloping tree, the falling branches - but I think she should paint a willow tree, and the willow tree is a well-known, easy Reproduction, plants that can survive in many places; and the roots, the image of the roots represented in the East is completely positive, they do not mind depicting it, and make many roots into commonly used utensils because it It symbolizes solid and reliable... As for the fragile lines that cannot be connected, they should express water, abundant water, and perhaps a wide river, because the house will become small because it is in the river. Opposite - Chinese paintings hate to describe everything in a meticulous manner, so doors and windows are likely to be omitted instead of no... there are no boats and bridges on the river, her home is isolated, but safe and close Water, this is a good sign - hey, if we are not careful enough, or have enough knowledge of her and the things behind her, it will be easy to play."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
