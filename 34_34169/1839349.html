			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boy gave a panic of panic, his facial features suddenly became inconspicuous, and the muscles squirmed under the skin - the noose around his neck suddenly Tightened, the blood rushed into his skull, and the dull and hot dimness shrouded his head again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don’t kill me." This time he pleaded with his eyes. When he became a woman, his eyes were still black. When he became a boy, he was blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then stay the same," said Anthony Hopkins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do as he said." Father Peter said that he had seen Chekler and Bissau become a melting plasticine. Toto said that he was possessed by the devil, but Peter felt that the demon possessed by Cheer, Bisangdi was also the one that he delivered loyalty and trust to Chekal. The inhuman form made him chilly, and the guy who changed between men, women, and children reminded him of the slippery octopus - he never ate octopus, he only likes to put it Grilled on the fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fr. Peter wraps around the noose and stands up from the ground, not fast or slow, but steady, he stands taller than the little boy, little boy I had to hold my chin desperately and lick my toes to get the hand that controlled my life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Father Peter does not necessarily need to be so careful, Sasha and Besib stand at the ends of the kitchen, they carry guns, and Hopkins The doctor stood at the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am just a trivial little person," the little boy said pitifully. "If you want diamonds - since you have found it, then Take it away - but please don't hurt me, let alone kill me, I don't care, I don't want to report or expose you, because you took the diamond, if I don't want to die, I can only run away. You have also seen, I have my ability. I can escape, run without a trace, no one can find me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Whether Anyone who can be associated with a 650 million person will not be a small person.” Besib smirked and said: “The reason why you say this is because you have no fear, you are delaying time – you have already issued Alert, notify your accomplices."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little boy showed an innocent look, although the lasso was tied around his neck, making him look like a puppy that was pulled out: "Why don't you say that I am Constantine. Lovin's people? Maybe Yelena was a blind man from the beginning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In this world, many men are happy to share lover or wife with others. For a kind of glory, but Constantine is definitely not included, especially he is the heir to the Cloven family. The shame that Ye Liena brought to him will not be cleaned for another 20 years. If you are his subordinate. I won't take Yelena to open his heart - he will really take your heart out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little boy did not respond, However, the blinking eyes showed that Sasha did not make a mistake. He looked around and said: "So, you are not an enemy. - Since you don't want diamonds, can you open your envy? Take the decoration on my neck. It's so tight that I can't breathe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you feel Will anyone be indifferent to the 650 million diamonds?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If it is, then you can just strangle me with a rope and take the diamond away. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We want to do this," said Father Peter. "But someone is calling him Mrs. Crowe... How? Are you lying? Yes, we will strangle you immediately, then run with diamonds. Your buddy can't stop us, bet?” The priest said happily: “Bet a dollar.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give you a dollar," the little boy sighed: "I admit that I lost."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So you also admit that you are Mrs. Crowe's man?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;A voice said outside the window. They were not surprised. A few minutes ago, in addition to Father Peter, the four people present heard the sound of the car sliding on the mud and the footsteps of human beings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am Ariksey. Mrs. Crovin’s health doctor," the man’s head shook outside the glass window of the kitchen. He was a ugly guy. "Please open the back door and let me come in and talk. It is too impolite."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib opened the back door, and Ariksey came in. Like everyone else, his feet were covered with mud. He was short, thin and yellow, and it was easy to think that he was malnourished or suffered during his teenage years. I have been abused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little boy twisted uncomfortably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter," Ariksey and kindly comforted: "If you switch to someone, you will use your methods when you are in the middle of your life. Is it Mrs. Cloven? Is it angry because her name shelters a person she loves and trusts? No, and she will be happy too--" He bowed slightly to Besib: "You respect her, even if You still have the life of this little guy without knowing the truth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The owner, though generous, needs to be humble." Peter The priest said a local proverb, and the noose that always threatened the life of the "little boy" has disappeared unconsciously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alixel took a meaningful look at the transparent stones that are worthless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s just a moment of the children," another doctor, Anthony Hopkins, said with a gentle and false statement: "We are also very surprised. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it really helpless?" Arik Seping responded with a sigh: "He is not even as good as two children."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A few hours ago, Konstantin Crowe was only a stone's throw from the pile of babies," Hopkins said. "How do you know that he won't be mad? Everyone rushed out, and then came over and overturned?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Constantine is a stubborn person," Alix said: "Only believe I don’t know that even the best tricks can’t be played again.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Ah, I think I saw it,” Hopkins The doctor said, "His people took a few cute little instruments and sneaked through the entire Aboriginal area, but they couldn't find anything. - Didn't he think of it? Does the instrument always have a way to make it work?" He opened the small box that looked unremarkable, and squeezed out a sleek, simple-shaped goose-oval earring with earrings as big as apricots. High quality, each diamond in two carats covers its entire surface. It is a set of diamond jewelry that Constantine first specifically stated to be completed and handed over to the martial artist Sir Raul. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Or, or,” Dr. Hopkins went on. “He thought that no one could guess the tricks that the world’s first smart person played. For example, what he really wants to send out is not only worth 200 million yuan. The diamonds were also given by the hand of the hacker Sir Raul..." He estimated: "A hundred grams or so of enamel, this metal is silvery white, although the density is different from platinum. More than double, the hardness is only half of platinum, and the gloss is a little different, but as long as it is coated with a layer of platinum and diamonds, it is difficult for laymen to discover the mystery."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"You are a real expert," Ariksey said. "So you found this secret."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But this has little to do with me." "Hopkins said: "I am silent about this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This can't blame you," said Ariksey. "You are a disciplined The guest, the lady asked me to express my gratitude - but if I can, I hope that you can continue to be silent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Hopkins made a "please explain" gesture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Please treat this as a little prank by an old child who is childlike," Alixe said calmly: "Tomorrow at noon 12 After that, her son will accept the accountability of the Presbyterian Church - the Jews are his subordinates, and Yelena is his affectionate wife, even the sly idea is his outer - he has to assume all the responsibilities. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why do you want to be after 12 o'clock?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alixe turns his eyes slightly and looks It was the big black-haired boy who was more respectful than the heirs of the Sangdi family. He nodded respectfully: "Because the airport can only block up to 12 o'clock tomorrow, and after 12 o'clock, all the planes will be unstoppable. They took off and flew around the world, and the passengers on the plane, almost all with more or less diamonds and diamond blanks, so that as long as the planes fly together, it means that most of these diamonds may I can't find it anymore - as for the vault, there is never one. The insurance company took over its business, because Constantine proudly believed that no one dared, no one could steal a diamond from this well-guarded, well-contained treasure house – until he opened the most The critical door.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who can do business in Orlosa will not really have a glimpse of the Cloven family and the family elders. The owners of the stolen diamonds contacted their "old friends" through various channels, complaining to them and claiming them.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
