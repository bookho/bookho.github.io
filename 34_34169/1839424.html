			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;72_72600 Besib thinks that the age of the "chalet" may not be big. In fact, he is very wrong. This building was built in the late sixteenth century. It is an old antique. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This building is a generous, generous, favorite lord who, in response to his invitation, came to the knights who participated in the contest. Those who are strong and most honored are allowed to live here instead of being distorted in a wet cowhide tent or living in a peasant's mud house with pigs. The ground floor was originally the place where the horses and the servants lived. The current slides originally led to In the contest, the knights can stop from the tolerance and do not disturb each other. In the absence of the contest, the lord will live here with his wife and children. We can see his fortress from here. There is no need to warm up the wine between the two, so that he can comfortably and safely."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brian said His smile was very sincere, and he could not see that he was facing the leader of a criminal. "The fortress belongs to it and has been repaired, but it has not yet been opened to the public."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The public? It clearly does not include the DuPont family, which has almost covered a quarter of the maintenance costs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The path to the fort is ancient, mottled and safe, with stone-paved drains and low walls on both sides of the road, triangular gravel Deliberately laying a little bit of unevenness to increase the friction between the horseshoe and the ground. The horses they ride are not much different from the merchants and farmers of centuries ago. They are strong horses, strong limbs and tall. There are fluffy and slender hairs under the knees, and it is very stable to walk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fortress was cleaned very cleanly, and there were no extra stones and gravel. They were led by the staff and surrounded by the tower and the city. The square passes through water wells, iron stoves, horse stables and warehouses. Climb the central tower, where the owner lives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is obviously uncomfortable to live in this place. The towers are made of rock and there are numerous gaps between the rocks. In order to resist the enemy, the rotation is upward. The stairs are narrow and the height is different, and there are no windows in the room. Only rectangular gaps are used to observe the enemy. In order to restore the situation at the time, the intervention of modern artificial lighting was minimized, and the staff lit a led light. The faint light illuminates the furniture in the room and the tapestry on the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the woodblock prints is quite large, like a screen that can cover three people, and the scene is vast. There are many people, and at the top is an angel or saint who hides in the clouds and overlooks the world. The middle level is a heavily armed knight. He holds a magnificently decorated sword, a cross on his chest, and a hand on his chest that he has received the revelation of heaven to prepare to punish the demon. But the focus of the painter is not on the two, the bottom, and the main body of the whole picture. Depicting a woman with a large number of digits, the kind that is naked. Among them, there are three women who are soothing and soothing. They are smooth and full of body. One of them is decorated with gems and pearls. The body is pressed with satin and fur. They are also the most complete in this picture. Other female figures are smaller, and they are all hung up, pierced by sharp spikes, and blood flows out of their bodies, flowing through the three adulteress who are entangled like snakes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This painting is based on Elizabeth Bartoli," Brian said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishb remembers that he had read a short biography about her - Elizabeth Bartoli is a female count, killing more than 600 women Extracting their blood and bathing for eternal youth. Between the 14th and 15th centuries, the most insane period of witch hunting, dozens of innocent women were burned to death every day, and her three complicity was The red iron pliers pulled out their fingers and burned and chopped their heads. Bartoli was only imprisoned in his own castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because she was born in a prominent family, her family is the richest and most influential in Hungary, her husband is a distinguished count, her The cousin is the king.” Brian said: “The witch-hunting behavior is almost exclusively for civilians and serfs – in fact, fortunately, because one of my ancestors was able to float the little things around when I was emotional, one The frightened maid yelled and yelled at the incident. After offering fifty gold coins and two red woolen cloths, the bishop ruled that the maid was bent over by the devil. In order to expel the devil, he used the sacred The flame, this nonsense rumor naturally disappeared with the flames - two years later my ancestor married a marquis and gave birth to five children, one of which you can see on my genealogy - - She wrote this on the margins of her Bible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nobles are always privileged, he said to himself, Brian Dupont It’s ridiculous to know this idea, since Already standing in the position of the beneficiary - he hates privilege, but he has to take advantage of the privilege. He has no courage to be honest with reporters. He has accidentally killed a person under the dual effects of alcohol and drugs. I don't have the courage to stick to my own thoughts and requirements - I won't be able to do it in the future. He can't save Famo and can't save himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe in the Middle Ages there were abilities." Besib said that they had returned to the warm room, Sasha sat on the bed with bare feet, one foot pressed under the soft pillow, the other foot Under his thigh, his laptop is on his leg, and Besib can see the five toes that are exposed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be honest, it’s great to not see the ugly leg pendant and hear the annoying snoring, Besib thinks his friend also Very easy, the most relaxing time of the past six months. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Think of those myths,” Sasha said lazily: “We have to doubt that the history of the abilities can be traced back to BC.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even in the twenty-second century, there will still be people calling you Messiah."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I don't know why they think so," Sasha said with a sigh of relief: "My ability is completely inferior to Stefan. For some of the abilities, it is simply dispensable and influential. Limited, the most important thing is that I lack the attack power. Without you or anyone else, I am only a little better than ordinary people. A bullet and a knife can kill me."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you think Brian Dupont will be an actor?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As far as I know, since the 'locust incident' After that, they succeeded in researching a sera used to detect abilities. After making sure it was reliable and safe, they gave them what they thought they needed to use. "No."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Institution?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Institution."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have always suspected that there is true love between them - I mean, agency and Samuel."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Just like a source."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When I sit down, I will find a way to clean up Samuel first."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha was teased by Besib’s words: "Then I will deal with institutions, I think many people are already dissatisfied with them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can submit a bill, "Nationalization of the Powers.""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And then chased by all the abilities?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishb once again laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snow road has three levels, the first level is the slide. The height difference is small. The ski slopes are flat on the primary ski trails, and the first-time skiers are awkwardly and slowly practicing various basic postures. All ski resorts add up to about thirty miles of snow. The second level is with the former. compared to. The height difference is increased, and the extended but equally flat intermediate ski trails are almost three to five times longer than the primary ski trails. You can slide your entire journey in a quiet, clumsy and monotonous manner. It is also possible to show off the attitude and technology that is at least a little better than the "ordinary", so it is the most popular among tourists; the third level is the high difficulty ski trail. - They all have rugged snow trails, more than forty-two degrees of slope, narrow paths, abrupt beaks and sinister depressions. Black rock piles like the reefs of the sea, the waves of the woods, the speed of the straight road can sometimes exceed 90 miles per hour. In most areas of the Western Continent, you will be given a speeding ticket when driving at this speed, and your body will also experience a gravitational acceleration of 3.5g. Exceeding the gravitational acceleration of the space shuttle's astronauts during take-off, but there is no doubt that they are also the most exciting, most fascinating and hard to give up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brian Dupont’s private ski run is connected to a ski resort that does not have a first grade of trail, and the second grade has only one trail and is a underworld. There are many ups and downs, and the other three are double black, which is the high difficulty ski trail. This ski resort is a natural way to deny the ordinary visitors of the 10th, unless they can come up with a certificate of the corresponding level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They take the open ridelift up the mountain, the cable car is about 30 feet from the ground, you must have all the equipment, ski poles when you ride it. Holding it in one hand, Besib felt that the seat was a bit like a large copy of the dumplings, and each one could pick up two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Lor raises his ski pole and greets Besib. He is the one who is used to this, but Besib gently slides into the seat. The movement in front of the chair was not much better. They leaned back slightly and fell into the seat together. The rest of Besib’s light was observed behind, and the red striped silver dress was dotted with Sasha. His left was Brian. His clothes are pure navy blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
