			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Chapter 251 has been completed, first go to see the chapter.)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Christmas For two months, their estate was occupied by a group of retired soldiers, the cook and the groom were driven away, and Anthony and his sister Sasha were taken into the warehouse - the cellar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They stand in front of the building that has been abandoned for nearly half a century, its roof has no tiles, and there are no mats and planks under the tiles. The original position of the windows and doors was hollow, like an old man who was dying to open his mouth with no tongue and eyes without eyes. The weeds reached into the room and grew unscrupulously on the walls and floors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A screaming anger screamed and gave up their nest, flapping their wings from the feet of two humans and ran out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Look, this is the fireplace." Anthony said, guiding Sasha to touch inside, the bricks were all removed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fireplace is really able to come in handy, the stove is very big, and Anthony’s sister, Little Sasha, discovered the secret, she is often hungry at night. When I couldn't sleep, I got up and got into the bricks. She couldn't figure out which piece was true. She often dripped her tongue with blood. The cook always woke up in time, found her, and then sneaked out the rest. The candle gave her a little sweet soup - a sweet soup made from the roots of the grass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She also carries her husband and Anthony to Sasha to eat milk, it’s strange that she has never had a child, but there is still milk in the ru room, maybe because of that Poor milk with a few mouthfuls, and a bite of corn or rat meat that Anthony and the groom gave her privately. Sasha was not as scary as other children. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They love her like that. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony took Sasha on his toes and went upstairs. Fortunately, the stairs in the manor were first cemented out of the skeleton, and then the wooden boards were laid on it. Years later, the wood that was not taken away was decaying like a dry sponge, but the pedestal remained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The railing is the iron flower, so it was also removed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a wainscotch with walnut and oak in the hallway, and a glass wall with golden enamel engraved glass. Hanging a small painting, before the children are born, the paintings are beautiful flowers and scenery, after the children are born. It was replaced by a pony and a puppy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are all gone now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doors of the room were removed before the manor was completely abandoned. They were oak, brushed with oil, dry, easy to burn, and wanted to be unloaded. Very convenient, every room is empty. In the third year after the war began, the owner of the manor carefully took the children to live in a large room, furniture and lights in other rooms. Curtains and decorations were sold or stored in the cellar, and the servants lived in the kitchen. The doors and windows of these two places were twisted and twisted by the reinforced iron bars, which was very ugly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the male and female owners died, the cook and the groom lived in the big room. The two children slept in bed and they slept on the floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a break, they opened the big bed and dropped into the simple stove, the mattress, the quilt and the pillow were taken by them. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former owner here took his son down the stairs at the end of the corridor. At the beginning, he and Sasha went hand in hand. The stairs were narrow, and Anthony Hopkins put his hands behind him, carrying his back, letting his sister hold, and Sasha's little finger pinched at his fingertips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stairs lead to the room where the servants live, the flank of the entire building. On the first floor, close to the kitchen and the barn, it was originally for the servants to walk, the squadrons occupied the place, they opened the wooden wall used as a partition. I integrated many rooms into one, the quilt and the pillow were thrown on the floor indiscriminately, and the wooden boards removed from other places were nailed to the windows and the doors. The nails were dead, leaving no gaps, only two were left. An exit - a window, a door, and a lot of horizontal strips, but can be opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the surviving windows, they can see the lush vegetation and the bright sky, but in Hopkins’ eyes, only white can be seen. , thick snow, blood buried in snow, a blonde hair, deciduous teeth, and a black walnut step stool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can see how the little sister who was taken off of all his clothes was dragged and pulled down in front of the stool. He prayed to God, heartily I hope she had already fainted or didn't understand what was going to happen. They let her face to the side. The warm, tearful rosy cheeks clung to the walnut stool with black ice. There was a person among them. Very good at using an axe, the only old horse left in the manor was his axe and cut the head of the triangle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The skilled executioner cut the head of Sasha, and the small head rolled to the snow, and the blood melted the snow. During the process of falling, her face fell to the foot of the stool, and the deciduous teeth were smashed. Did you feel pain, did you yell? Her eyes, reflecting the color of the eggplant, also contain transparent hot tears and the innocent innocence of the most innocent angels. The axe still stays on the stool, the blood of the old horse remains on the stool, the blood of the deer And the blood of Sasha, and the sun-like blond hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They use a knife to separate the body of the sand, soft, white and tender body, pale yellow ochre fat, pink viscera and flesh - Anthony's parents, Anthony, the cook and the groom used a variety of delicious, chocolate, cream, honey, sausage, and small-sized children to become meat, just like the butchers on the market. The meat that was placed was cleaned up and divided into different categories. The hungry soldiers surrounded them like silent flies and vultures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside the slaughterhouse, they set up a fire, and the one that was found in the kitchen, the only one was hung on the shelf, Anthony. Hopkins remembers that the last time parents gave Sasha a weight measurement before they went to the city, Sasha's weight was forty pounds. How much meat did they take from her? They were cooked together with bones. They ate meat, sucked the bone marrow in the thigh bones, and left the remaining bones in the soup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smell of the soup is so rich, Anthony Hopkins can never forget it in this life, it is long, from the campfire Go up to the snow, then walk from the snow to the room, and walk from the room to the cellar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his illusion, the door of the mantle is open, and the real mantle has no door. This is a semi-underground cellar, also a warehouse, people are Put things that are not used temporarily, and store foods and wines that are not easily deteriorated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers also store the "food" inside, and they give the children something to eat. Because the dead meat is sour and bitter, it will be poisoned when eaten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are not many things left, each child has a wooden spoon, which probably has a half bowl weight. The horse meat is sour, the venison is very savage, and the meat taste of the companion is very fragrant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers took turns to feed the children, because the soldiers in charge of this work were able to take the opportunity to peel off a hot soup from each child’s mouth, as long as the “food” did not die. It’s not good to lose meat soon. It’s not the north. The snowstorm won’t last long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were originally seven children in the cellar, and Anthony’s younger sister was the fourth to be taken away. Anthony would be the next one. His father is a fighting enthusiast. He began to consciously train him while Anthony was still learning to walk. He used to eat better than other children, grow stronger, and withstand the fear and hunger and thirst of other children. . On weight, he is the best. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scent ran into the cellar without a little sound. In the dark, the sound of breathing became bigger. The children instinctively opened their nostrils, and they were all hungry. There is no strength, or you will surely squat on the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers are eating his sister. Anthony heard the snoring of chewing, pouting and drinking soup. His arm was broken and he could not feel pain at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers who sent them soup came in. When they fed Anthony, he said, "Try the taste of your sister." Anthony ate. Greedy, there is no drop of land, it is the taste of chocolate, butter, honey. There is a small broken bone at the bottom of the spoon. His teeth bite the spoon, and every small bone is smashed down into the mouth. He bites the spoon and the soldier holding the spoon looks at his eyes and shines in the dark. The force from the spoon made him shudder, he was like competing for food with the devil in hell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldier took a lot of effort to pull out the spoon, he sweated, angry and scared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went back and said to others, they agreed to eat Anthony Hopkins tomorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that night, another army came to this small manor, they came from a big country, had enough rations, and took a doctor, More than half of the deaths in the battle, and a small half surrender, the blizzard is at the end, not so violent, but to escape is still a dead end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the winners, the highest position is a lieutenant. He took his soldiers to open the door of the cellar, rescued the children, and the doctor gave the children I did an inspection and fed them a little sugar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Hopkins closes his eyes, he hears the doctor talking, with a strong Saxon accent, "kill those captives." He calmly proposed to the lieutenant: "Can't let them go out - they are the beasts who have eaten the 'best' things, even if the war is over, the trees are full of fruit, and the fields are full of crops, The walls are full of bacon and sausages, and every night, they still remember the delicious food they have eaten these days – nothing can be better than the stomach and the food they eat when they digest themselves. They won't forget, they will find a way to eat another meal. Apart from this, there is nothing to satisfy them. They are no longer human."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
