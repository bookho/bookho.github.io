			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good guy!" Henry, a sweaty man, shouted, his eyes reflected the golden light, and he made a dull call. Drinking the sound, the drums spurt the body, and the branches he relies on sing in a sudden increase in weight. They bend down and approach the limit, as if they will break or fall into the swamp at any time. Fortunately, They finally stuck to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man walks fast from the precarious temporary bridge and the trapped ground with a dexterity and strength that is in no way consistent with his age and body, licking at least one Twenty pounds of muddy head, squeezing through branches and branches, and narrow gaps between epiphytes (some branches will jump back and slap his cheeks after being pushed away), he found it on the pump His net bag, hurriedly put the head and the squid inside together, his movements have been very fast, but the squid has been falling down all the way, now although there is a net bag, but some small long fish are still They can pass through the mesh, they are smashing, and the rain falls on the ground like a rope that is twisted with magic. No two or three times, they get into the loose moss and mud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I should bring two net pockets, one big eye, one small eye." He said, "Spanish people like small squid, They will put the small squid and garlic together and fry together before and after the New Year, plus olive oil, oh, that's a high-end dish."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With two pumps, Henry twirled the net and turned a corner. He walked over the bridge and stopped at where the lights could not be reached: "Oh," he blinked in the darkness: "I forgot that there are children. Here," he said eagerly: "Sorry, but I have to hurry up and pick them up, or they will go home. Teacher, can you leave with your child? Or let him go back? Just ten minutes is enough. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Treyef looked down at his child, then another: "I don't think so," he raised his voice slightly: "But you The child doesn't seem to be very good. Would you like me to take him away?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henry stood In the dark, Streif clearly heard that he was blowing his nose: "No, no," he said fiercely. "He doesn't need it any more. He is a daring little devil. He just suddenly feels a little uncomfortable. "Is it right, Tom?" he asked sternly. "Okay, I am coming over."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He screamed and walked over, and the light projected on the bridge took him to the light, and Strath could only see his outfit - he wore a double-breasted short coat, which The style is a bit familiar. If Streif is not mistaken, it is equipped in the army, short coat, tough like iron, and waterproof, no need to return after service. Inside the jacket is a black rubber bib with pants, the kind of butcher often worn in the fish market, the pants are pressed in the long rain boots, the interface should be bandaged, or something else is tied - So, yes, that's because the territory below the squirrels has been smothered by the dark brown mud, and they are closely attached to Henry's legs, like the flowing third or fourth layer. skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head was carefully placed up by Henry, and the brown head of the squid continued to stick out from the swollen tongue and the yellow-colored gums. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The net pocket was gently resting on the bridge, Henry twisted his head and shoulders, and took off the double row that barely noticed the color. Shorting the coat, he pulled a small bundle of rope from his pocket, tied the neckline first, then the sleeves, and firmly fastened all the buttons - so he had an extremely spacious pocket - he lifted the net pocket , shaking, pouring things into it, the dog's head rolled in a small margin around the pocket, and more small squid drilled out of the wet black fur. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sour smell is diffused, but it can be tolerated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henry leaned down with joy, he grabbed the dog's lower jaw, pulled its mouth open, and the yellow-yellow gloves disappeared into the black hole's hell entrance. The front end of the glove has a non-slip thorn, and he easily grabbed a small head and dragged it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a squid with a length of about one and a half feet, which is as thick as a child’s wrist, and the greasy mucus falls off the crazy, swaying tail. Mr. Henry stuffed it into one of the sleeves, followed by the second, third...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boy standing next to Sasha gripped tightly With his own arms, he was pale, and the cold sweat came out of his hair. There were traces of vomiting on his lips, shining under the light - he didn't have the courage as his father boasted, but he didn't want to His father was disappointed and humiliated, so he could only stay here - but as far as Streif was concerned, he was about to collapse, not in the next second or in the next minute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last break of this not so strong wall was a move by Mr. Henry. After cleaning the mouth, his fingers reached into the two empty eyes and happily stirred inside, or tried to sink down. oppression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dog’s ear suddenly stood up, just as it was alive, and heard something that wasn’t, but then a brown head from white The fluffy group slipped out, and the small eyes of the squid were like two shiny sesame seeds. It opened its mouth and showed its tiny, dense teeth under the light. Mr. Henry grabbed it rudely and pulled it out. It's hard to say what color and texture, and the slimy things have come out. Even Sasha, you have to think about it to understand that it is the dog's brain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henry’s son opened his mouth, and a grayish-white liquid filled with semi-solid food squirted straight through the throat, drawing an arc in the air. The line was poured on the elated Mr. Henry and his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha looked up, and Streif immediately hugged him up, and the smell was more ugly than the dog that had never completely rotted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Henry was very upset, because both hands were dirty, he lifted his shoulders and wiped his face, but there was also the slime of the squid. And his son's vomit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He made an annoyed look and tried to control the shameful son. There is a smaller, more delicate child next to him! People don't vomit, and they look as usual, and they don't even turn their eyes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The child is really disappointing now." He said dryly, the joy just disappeared: "Can't you stop?" He rebuked his son: "Look, you made it... dirty!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The child looked up and looked down, then continued to bow his head uncontrollably. To vomit, the food that was swallowed before, whether it has been digested or not digested, has almost vomited, and now it is the turn of the yellow-brown juice that flows down his tongue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha’s hand was inserted into his pocket. He took a blueberry out of his pocket, the sour one, and handed it to Henry’s son. In his view, the mental stress caused by Henry's reprimand is one of the follow-up reasons for vomiting - maybe not one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the berries were taken, the boy cried and kept groaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, many times, children’s behavior is not controlled by their thoughts." Treff said that he put Sasha down and let him and that Boys together: "Let them be together, do you need me to help?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, no, no." Henry's tight forehead relaxed slightly. Some, "I can do it alone, you look at the child, maybe you are right." He leaned back again and focused all his attention on the squid, although he was not so happy. "Do you want to bring two back? Squid, children and women, men have benefits... you don't want to? Do you mind their origins?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “How do you think so?” Treff said: “I am just not very good at cooking squid. I don’t like to waste food, especially those that should be very delicious... No, I don’t care about fishing methods – Only in recent decades have people started using cone nets or fork valves to catch squid at the water flow. Before that, fishermen used fresh pig heads instead of other heads to trap squid - fresh carrion It will make them desperate to flock. I saw a very detailed description of a German writer born in 1929, where the head of a dark horse was used."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My grandfather used the sheep's head as a bait, the nearby restaurant provided lamb, but no one would eat the sheep's head, and few people knew that the sheep's head could be used like this," Henry said. I can't be afraid at all, I like squid, Really don't? It's a shame. Today's squid is fat and strong." He added: "More."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henry pulled out ten from the dog's head Several squid with a foot length and dozens of small squid, the pump is still booming, the swamp is about to be drained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly became thoughtful, and Treff found that he was staring at several other small swamps, and Anne Kent’s grave was among them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you think I have to pump them one by one?" Henry said excitedly: "There will be more squid inside."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe." Treff agreed. "But I must remind you, as you said, that the dog's head is not a mushroom, not biogas, it won't grow automatically or It is transformed - it is very likely that it was consciously thrown here by someone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
