			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldier who wanted to blackmail looked at the gap in disbelief. He remembered that the ground in the barn was very smooth and smooth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh," the intermediary said indifferently: "I only have this coin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "It doesn't matter," said the soldier who inherited the ideas and practices of the leader. "God has already made its judgment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is still like the lubricant Smooth and light, his pistol was pulled out, and his two companions were shocked. The muzzle of the Glock pistol flashed a dazzling fire, and a monk who was climbing under the cover of others was knocked out of the neck. The head fell into the arms of a person and died on the spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several children in the Boy Scout screamed uncontrollably, and the two boys’ trousers around Boa’s suffocating stench The children moved backwards and looked like they were trying to avoid them. In fact, he hid himself behind other people. Behind him is the wall, his hands groping on the rough rocks, and dig the dirt on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your idea is stupid," said the soldier. "Even if these monks and their families are willing to pay, political fu and police cha will not be willing to let others I realized that there is such a way of making money. They would rather let us and hostages rotten here. - On TV and in newspapers, they will say very well, but it turns out that they will never compromise, whether it is right. Those idiots before us are still us - since the establishment of the federation, like this situation, the record of being able to get the money and successfully escape is zero, understand it, zero! Zero! Zero! One has not succeeded!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you really want to kill everyone?" Another soldier asked: "If you are a monk, there are too many people who treat children as saviors." No matter what, once it involves the child - it is like a horse cell."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There have been five small mixed balls died in the baptistery. And everyone here, as long as there is another person alive, able to speak, can write You can blink your eyes - the greedy insatiable dogs can follow us on the clues they have given us. Do you really want this? Dear saint? Do you want a monk here to reserve a niche for you?" Interest in money The missing soldier laughed at him without a trace of affection. Until his companion raised his hands and said to surrender. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldier smiled with joy and revealed a sly smile. He turned to face the angry and desperate hostages: "Try it, shit!" He snarled at the monk and the child: "All the time, you are going to die. Are you not ready to resist?" Are you thinking about it? Prepare to be so weakly lying on the ground waiting to be killed? This is too ridiculous. Coward! Look down, do you still have eggs in your pants? This is really the last chance. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boa grabbed the ground, the nails were full of dirt, and the three nails turned over, and he didn't realize it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hurry up," he whispered silently. "Come on! It’s going to be long!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp [&nbsp;&nbsp;Hundreds of years ago, the farmer and the craftsmen relied on their own hands, devout hearts and simple tools to work day and night in the solid rock below the monastery, and to create a huge for the dean and the nobles. The underground burial chamber and the treasure land, and the secret research and cultivation of aphids (more correctly, the 83 viruses, 14 bacteria, 17 thermotoxins, 32 protozoa carried by the aphids) further broadened the researchers. Its space, in order to prevent virus leakage and locust escape, in addition to the closed passages and rooms, they also poured concrete and paved asphalt on the rocky ground around the monastery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unknown workers are very happy to accept this highly rewarding job. In order to express their own wishes, they also renovated the barn for free, changed it to a new door, the roof, the asphalt under the mud, it looks the same, but it is much stronger than the original. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dean did not point the place to the leader for no reason. Three hundred years ago, a dexterous thief opened a secret door on the wall of the barn. He used a small iron chisel and a drill to dig the outer stone and pull out the filled gravel. Pushing the inner stone again - before that he had made a piece of wood that was about the size of the hole, and fixed the thin slab with glue before and after, making it as thick as the wall, pushing it to block it. Hole. Usually fixed with a thin mud, when the monks fill the peasants' dedication, he will open the "door" in the middle of the night and climb in, only steal a little something at a time - for twenty years, no one I realized that he finally said it when he was doing dying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The abbot of the monastery knew about this after that. After pondering for a while, I decided not to block the hole: "Take this as a little feedback to our people." He said that his subsequent abbots have proved to others that they respect the predecessor. And loved, did not move it, the stone fell, the monks will fix it when the board is decaying. When the workers repaired the barn, the dean made a special bow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monks knew the hole, and the dean thought they could find the opportunity to escape with the children. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They failed to find this opportunity, and the leader’s soldiers were very vigilant. Adults and children are placed on either side of the barn and no action is allowed. The hidden hole is in the middle of them, relying on the children's near point. The monk who was interrupted by the neck just wanted to push it away. Maybe in a mess, several children could get through it and escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Quick!" Boa digs the dirt on the ground, whispering, and he bites his lips nervously, fearing that he will yell out - He couldn't see the purple vetch in front of the barn and the grass behind the barn, mainly the ryegrass that were swaying, the leaves and stems were unchanged, and the milky white roots were stretching at a few centimeters per second. Strong, drilled under the wall of the barn, shaking the foundation of the wall; the roots of the big tree and the vines are closely followed, the brown roots are stronger than the roots of the ryegrass, they are like the 蚯蚓Rushing in the land, popping out of the ground, smashing stones on the wall, looking for the weaker parts of the connection between them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldier who claimed to be neutral looked around, because the ground that had been cursed thousands of times in the baptismal hall, the ground shivered slightly for a long time. It suddenly stopped a few minutes ago, but then it intensified - he really wanted to go out and see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, have you felt..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You fucking is refreshing Let's go, look at God's sake," the object he asked didn't even hear what he was saying. He was busy rushing to "the second leader", who was immersed in the thrill of intimidation and threats - - The former was entangled in frustration and irritability, and the mission was unsuccessful. They did not get paid. The leader also died: "You are all hybrids!" He shouted and cursed the trigger. I don't know if it was intentional. Only one bullet broke the arm of a monk, and several other shots hit the dim wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The disguised stone wall suddenly shattered, and everyone was sluggish for a moment. The first action was Boa - he pushed A boy was opened and he even climbed into the hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three soldiers fired. It takes only two to three seconds for the twenty bullets in their rifle to shoot, and in these two or three seconds, sixty or seventy bullets can kill everyone here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why this tragedy could not be staged may be God's will. Just as the stone wall shattered, the crack that swallowed the coin suddenly widened and lengthened. The big one was like the time of James II. The child trafficker draws on the face of the child who needs to be broken, the wound from the left ear to the mouth, and then from the mouth to the right ear (see the protagonist), like a piece of cake that is opened, The barn was divided into two halves. The place where the soldiers stood was the part that was discarded. It fell backwards, fell and rolled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers were suddenly smashed by dirt and gravel, and they were still pulling the trigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the chaos, two more people were hit, one was a monk and the other was a child, they were immediately caught by others Climbing - the branches of the roots and vines violently reached into the barn's wounds, pulling stones and dirt out of the outside - the panic in the panic didn't make more orders, which saved many people, especially the injured. People and Boy Scouts, when they are involuntarily following the earth and stone, the vines and the roots wrap them up and pull them up until they are fixed in a safe place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib and others are also beneficiaries, a tree with peeling bark climbing hundreds of thick vines, vines are like snakes Searching in the grass, wraping up the people who are trying to climb up, dragging them up and sending them to the highest tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie holding his father, leaning on the branch of the branch against the trunk, the safest place here, Sasha put Lila on her lap, Besib Sitting at a distance not far from the end of the thin, press the branches out of a bend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tower next to the barn slowly dumped and crushed the part left by the barn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it safe enough?" he asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It should be enough." Sasha said: "This is not a natural stream of earth and stone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp A little further, the monastery, which is cruelly preserved by the devil, is plunging into the whirlpool of gravel and sand, and the flames and black smoke, like the stalks of the flower gardens, support this ancient building that has been lingering for centuries- - It is unwilling to lean, smash, and scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The terrible roar and thousands of tons of mud rushed into the jungle, the shoal, the Grand River. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
