Sasha said incredulously: "I just don't know?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get it," Besib walked out of the bathroom. He didn't bother to wipe the water with a towel. Instead, he licked his hair like a black Newpoliston. The hair in the hair is full of water, and it has been illuminated by the afternoon sun for nearly two hours. The warmth can make people feel that the soft floor suddenly appears a circle of transparent little dots, "just a kiss!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A kiss." Little Hopkins repeated gloomyly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A kiss," Becky confused and said, "What's the matter?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Before the start of the school, Avery left here, replaced by Little Beppe. He is the new ninth grader of Grande. In order to get this quota, the casino under the name of Chegar has lost a large amount of income - but this is quite worthwhile. Beppe's father is a steady and capable guy. Chegal’s loyalty, Beppe’s mother is Chegar’s cousin, and Beppe’s own is flexible enough. Anyway, he was originally in Chegal’s plan – after him, there will be More children of Poseidon Island enter the universities of the Western Continent, where they will gain knowledge, bonuses, degrees, important "friends", and the money and status that come with these friends, they will be in the vast western continent. The huge skeleton that belongs to Poseidon Island is built... It is like a coral. At first, they are just small insects that are invisible to the naked eye. They float in the sea, find places, fix, grow, gather together, they die. With a hard skeleton tomb, the new generation continues to grow healthily and vigorously, from generation to generation, from generation to generation... just like this, three generations. Or after four generations, Poseidon Island may disappear so quietly - just as Chegaler than Sangdi wished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The golden age of the mob has long passed, and the path of the perpetrators will only get narrower and narrower – what else can they do? Drugs, weapons, color/love, these are still alive and well in the past half century. The unscrupulous "sales and purchases" are now strongly suppressed and crushed by the authorities and the state machine. In this technology, the technology is increasingly developed. However, the law is prosperous, and the law is strictly one day, and the day after day, the glory of Poseidon Island is like the setting sun. If you can't get the decisive right position in the last few decades, wait for it - complete demise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a pity that not everyone can have a long-term vision like Chekal and Sangdi. It can be said. So far, most of the Poseidon people are still walking the path of their grandfather and father. They are keen on smuggling, gambling, fighting, murder, spending all the extra energy on the embarrassment, hatred and law, and despising scholars. Despise women and children—their children are far more educated at home than in schools, and the authority of parents is better than everything else—Cejal does not want to change this, but he has his own ideas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope our children can grow up in a peaceful environment, they can walk up the street to buy an ice cream or with their own friends. They play; for a failed test paper or a love letter that has been returned; when they need it, they don’t hesitate to report to their parents and their profession; they can watch their parents die in bed at home; They don't have to put a dagger or a pistol in their pockets. They don't have to worry when they see it, their legs are trembling; their children can become scholars, soldiers, and politicians. They are respected and loved."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A wonderful dream." Anthony Hopkins was so appreciative. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Beip’s appearance made Sasha’s thoughts run away, but it quickly returned to its original position – Bepby Sasha It’s still a few months smaller than Besib, but he is already a child’s father! The child’s mother is only sixteen this year. They will be married to Bepman when he was twenty. Beppep got the color photos of the fetus yesterday. The photos are clear and can be seen with half-closed eyelids, nostrils and fingers, toes, head and translucent body. same size. Beppe said that he had two shackles (his dad's and her father's) and a few temporary deposits of his future scorpions for "this stuff." But he thinks it is worth it. He likes little babies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"14 years old," said Little Hopkins. Gloomy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Beep, give us some sandwiches, and then order yogurt soda," and Beppe was sent away, Besib said: "Okay. Now, let's say what is irritating to you - don't tell me it's just because of a kiss - is there a problem with the girl?" Besib didn't think that the disorder of Sasha originated from the girl itself. Sasha only looks like a good and shy gentleman. In fact, they are all similar. Poseidon Island can't get the kind of waste idiot that looks at the prey in front of it and does nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's just a little surprised."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not very good," Bessie said with a smile: "You didn't tell the truth, dear." The sun was very comfortable. He was lying on the floor directly. It is hard to be called "boy" again. The body is tall and strong, but the muscles are not exaggerated. The skin that was tanned during the summer vacation has not yet recovered to its original color. It is very smooth, and the light thrown into the house outside the window dyes his hair into a beautiful gold. "Get it... Dear, you should talk to me, this is fair - see, I have nothing to say to you, you know me well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not exactly the right thing to say," Sasha said slowly. "I mean, I didn't understand you as you described, or if something went wrong, then What you said and what you are doing now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib squinted, he needs to think about it to understand what Sasha is referring to," Oh," he knocked on the floor thoughtfully: "I know what you are saying, you mean that... Daisy, "Is it?" He slammed his head: "Cute little Sasha, I said it in the morning, it was just a kiss."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And then?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you change someone else, you really have to fall into the fog, but Besib still knows about Little Hopkins, "Let me think about... He thought for a moment, pointing to a bunch of pink-white wild roses that came out of the window from the window. It was autumn, but they were still very good. The petals were delicate and the flowers were golden. "Do you see those flowers?" "He raised his hand, his fingers stretched like a macaroni slowly, wrapped around the thin stem with a small thorn, and folded it down. "Good flowers." The son of the thug leader praised poetry. Sasha shuddered with a blank expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishb took back the flowers on his fingers and fingers, sniffed his nose, and finally licked his lips and kissed him: "This is the case," He explained: "I saw this, I felt very cute, the color and shape were flattering, the smell was good, so... it was just a kiss." He paused: "As for the result, I can only say good. Very happy. If there is a chance, I will kiss her once again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark-skinned boy lies on the hot floor, slightly cool The wind blew in through the window, with the fragrance of flowers and trees, the water in his body evaporating, all of which made him feel very comfortable. He turned his head and looked at the friend who was in silence - he knew Sasha Hope. At the time of Kings, he and Hopkins were only real "children". Just look at the appearance. At that time, Sasha was really a little angel! (Although reality quickly broke this illusion). However, many children (at this age) are particularly beautiful, and Sasha is certainly one of the best, but it is not surprising that the difference between the real boys and other boys (and girls) is after entering puberty. When they walked through the streets of Poseidon Island, or when they went to church, few people could not look at the friends of Besib, the girls were ashamed, the women were more generous and enthusiastic. Most men will shake their heads after a short glimpse and draw a cross on their chest to show their incredible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, Sasha Hopkins still had some uncertainty, but in the past two years, especially this year, Besib has been able to determine that God did not make a consistent mistake in his friend (it may be just a Mischief) - Many beautiful children will be distorted during the growth process and cannot be seen at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little Hopkins does not, his face and body seem to be more perfect every day, Besib does not know how it will be fixed in the end Unbelievable, but he noticed that even now, when he had to face Sasha, Beck would intentionally or unconsciously remove his sight - human beings are always pursuing beauty, but the ultimate ugly and extreme The beauty of the city is scary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There was a girl last night...should be a good one," Sasha added. "Into my room."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishb encouraged him with his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She sat on me, almost all over her body," Sasha said slowly, considering what the words are: "...I told her For a while..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishb tried to control his expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Later, she left."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishb waited for a while, sure to end Then he said: "What is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a problem ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because I follow the books I have read and the information I have received, I should be a bit responsive - for example, the heartbeat is accelerated, the temperature rises, and the erection Class... Is it right?” Sasha frowned: “But I don’t, don’t say.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is true, in order to worry about this... ...Besib is stunned, and for the first time I feel that God is fair. It is necessary to write down this matter for the future to tease Hopkins for 50 years, but he must help his friends now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I like this flower very much," said Besib, who was holding the wild rose. "I kissed it. There is still flowers outside. They are also very beautiful, but I don't kiss them one by one - because I don't like it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
