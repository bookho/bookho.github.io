			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter 162 The End of Polyfimo (below)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A glare The white light illuminates the entire helicopter cabin, Gregory is caught off guard, his eyes are hurt, tears are uncontrollably shed, he holds his face, the helicopter is violently bumpy, the agent is just filled with straw The woven bag was smashed to the other side of the cabin, and then rolled along the walls of the cabin. If it wasn't for Abel's eyes, he would fall out of the helicopter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is this a bit of a dog?" Gregory squinted in pain, trying to see what was in front of him, but just strong Light made his eyes only see a white, he raised his ears, only heard the helicopter, the huge rolling sound. A pair of powerful arms pushed him and forced him to sit back to his original position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The belt on the seat of Abra, tied Gregory Corso firmly on the seat, his technique is skillful, but his movements are Very rough, everything was placed properly, Gregory grinned and said: "Thank you." Abel picked up his eyebrows in amazement, but he immediately remembered that this guy who was a bit stunned was a successful agent - every year. There are no fewer than 2,000 new singers in the Western Continent, but they can only be said to be prominent. The audience and the media are some monsters that have been engraved into the bones. They have a picky and unrecognizable The tongue, the appetite is small, it is like an ant, they despise repetition, and the unchanging things will make them tired; but if you dare to "change" and "innovate", you must beware of their suspicion and ridicule. ——How many singers disappeared into people’s eyes, ears and memories after two or three songs and one or two albums? There are countless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xi's sing for ten years, standing on the sharp pyramid tip, her talent and weird looks are certainly one of the reasons, but Abel Believe that Gregory Corso's operation has a large weight in it - the big one can make everyone who is likely to stand in the West Side feel grateful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides Xiqiao. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abel saw the girl stupid when she was reading the information. She only saw what she had lost. I didn’t see what I got – Gregory was not an idiot with a slap in the face and a quick success. He has been carefully raising her, from the Great Victoria Lake 12 years ago to the Polyphemo, the experience of Xiqiao. Even Cinderella, who wears crystal shoes, must sigh by herself. In any case, she is really low and terrible. If she does not have Gregory, she may now be placed in a black leather rich businessman. In the display cabinet, of course, it is cleaned up and divided. After drying and defatting treatment; it is also possible that her heart and kidneys will be soaked in the formalin solution, waiting for the witch doctor to take them out carefully and carefully in a certain cast. Mixed with the crushing of some poisonous insects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory took her money, but that doesn't mean she can't squander her food. Her diet is exquisite and reasonable, elegant and comfortable, in order to avoid glare and sunshine. Her inbound and outbound vehicles use expensive one-way glass. She can also go to the luxury store at night under the supervision of Gregory. Abel sees a bill and the night is used by Xiqiao. Lost millions of dollars - just for the purchase of leather bags. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"High point." Abel said that the driver made a "understand" gesture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two helicopters hovered under their feet, they were so close. The face of each other in the cabin can be clearly seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xi's pale hair and face flickered behind the glass window, a man sitting next to her, and there were two people behind them. There is one next to the driver. The helicopter was painted white in white, with "cbs" printed on the tail, and blue wavy stripes around it. These signs seem to indicate that it came from the Western China Cable News Network, but it turns out that this recognition It’s awful. The people in their stomachs lacked the "accidental" interest in concerts and concerts, and their mission was not in any relationship with the former - when the pillars at the foot of Xiqiao were about to collapse completely. They threw a rope ladder to her, and an invisible person protected her from climbing up. The people in the helicopter reached out to them and pulled them into the cabin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other helicopter is a new double-seat helicopter transformed from a small old-fashioned Bell 47 helicopter. There is only one person except the driver, a young one. The man, wearing a bad taste, is enough to create the urge to "kill him." He stands at the door of the helicopter cabin, and his spirit is awkward. A rolling electric ball is formed in the palm of his hand: "Come this!" The voice is called the martyrdom, the arm is unfolded, and the ball-like lightning expands, stretches and densifies between the hands. It becomes a silver, bright and dazzling net, and of course the net is not fish. It passed over to the white-blue helicopter cover, just as powerful as the person who created it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "See?" Besib grew his mouth. "I didn't expect this slut to have this hand?" He licked his lips. "I like it." That move."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The collapse of the inverted pyramid open-air venue seems to have come to an end. This strange building is leaning on the water, and the harsh cracks and bending sounds still exist. But it has been small and a lot less. Fortunately, the viewers who have not been crushed underneath have floated up to the surface of the water. There is a faint cry in the darkness. The moonlight illuminates the white clothes or decorations. Now it looks like They are like white butter that floats a little on the cuttlefish soup. The passage that Sasha and Besib have traveled/walked through has been completely turned into a steep well, and only the two boys who are used to anaerobic diving in the sea can sneak up straight in the dark water. Hundreds of feet - then you have to crawl longer in the damp and hot metal ramp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they finally came out on a certain platform, even Sasha couldn't help but utter a foul language. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha is busy wringing out the water in his hair. His hair is thin and dense, soft and abundant. Besib used to call it "Golden Wool". The feeling of going up and touching is very good, but it is very difficult to dry it after soaking in water. He has to grab the hair of the forehead, wring them, then the sides, and finally the back of the head. He was treated separately, and he was very envious of Besib. Besib's black hair is similar to that of a swan or a wild duck. It is rough and smooth, as if it were born with a layer of grease. He needs more shampoo than ordinary people, but after coming out of the water, he only needs With your head in your head, you can get rid of most of the troublesome waterdrops - his swaying head is a black Labrador - his clothes can't be done in a swaying way. The son of the thug leader was stripped off, leaving only a tight-skinned snake with a thin leather belt on his body. This one is worth 150 yuan, the texture is comfortable and the most important. It's solid and comes with a large, sturdy mesh back pocket, and Besib's gun stays securely inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not a shame for Besib’s words. Besib likes anything as powerful and powerful, and he is much more demanding. Even if the idiot is not an enemy, well, they are indeed in a cooperative state, and his terrible taste alone is enough to make more than a dozen Sasha retreat. What's more, they are very clear, as long as they can find opportunities, whether it is Martin or Hopkins. The prospective eye will kill the other one, and the "head" is quite clear about this, so he is always trying to find the distance between the two - whether it is Sasha Hopkins and Martin. Still Martin and Anthony Hopkins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't think it's that easy," Sasha said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe you are right." Besib looked up at his head, and his heart was fascinated by the darkness of the sky, which was particularly strange. The scene... An invisible circular barrier clung to the white helicopter, and the current that was thrown out frantically flowed and exploded outside the invisible sphere, over time. Their attacks gradually became weak and the form began to dissipate. Two helicopters cast two balls that were nearly solid. Their light made Besib block his eyes with his arms. When he lowered his arms, the two balls were deeply embedded in the barrier, and the electric light was on them. It’s beautiful, surrounded by golden, orange, white and blue. "Wow," said Besib. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They stagnated for about half a minute, and finally Martin was impatient, he added two new chips, the barrier was visible to the naked eye - Xixi, who had no clearness, appeared in the window. Besib’s eyesight was very good. He could see her open her mouth. The two-person helicopter swayed vigorously after a few seconds. The tasteless shirt was in the cabin. The ball swayed, the ball lost control, and they were gently bounced out. It can be seen that the pilots of the two-person helicopter tried their best to avoid them. He succeeded three-quarters, one The small electric ball hit the tail of the helicopter, and it instantly climbed the entire body of the body. It contained energy that was not enough to cause the helicopter to catch fire or explode, but it was enough to destroy the electronic equipment - it was almost I planted it all the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white helicopter got rid of the threat, it immediately rose, crossed a quarter of a circle in the air and flew south. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s awful," Gregory said sullenly: "You have failed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Abel glanced at him and returned to his seat in silence: "The show is over," after a while, he said: "Mr. Corso, we can all go home."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nearly half a dozen green vines coiled on a fairly solid support rod for several turns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baoer. Noel Douglas climbed up with another person, and he saw Besib and Sasha at a glance, unexpectedly, the boy’s light There weren't too many emotions in the blue eyes. He seemed to have grown more than twice in the past half hour. He first let the vines wrap around on his own body before pulling the people below. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your aunt," Besib reminded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," Sasha said, "I saw it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He should go Look for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Then she saved Douglas." Sasha shook her head, she always made people laugh and cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine saw Sasha, she wanted to come, but was blocked by a huge crack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baoer held her and pointed to the "ground" at the foot of Beb and Sasha, a double-layer tempered glass that was bitten in a stainless steel clamp. Also referring to her feet, Besib and Sasha can know what he is saying from his movements even if he does not listen. The glass may support two boys, but with an adult female. It's hard to say - Catherine was convinced, and she stepped back and looked worriedly at the boys, who were only about fifty feet apart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He is smart!" Besib said with surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is always smarter than the paramecium."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
