			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;313<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little Hopkins and Little Bisang sit shoulders shoulders On the thick branches of the black-skinned paulownia, the crows fell on Hopkins's shoulders, picking up their cheese pieces and assorted nuts from the bag he was holding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Pipa, also known as Saffron Sycamore, which can grow up to fifty-five feet, and the paulownia outside their dormitory is over forty feet. The light of the street lamp can't be affected here. As long as the two people pay a little attention and conceal, it will not be found that some people are blatantly violating the law on their heads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha and Besib can even see the lake in the distance, which is like a reflection of the moonlight against the dark trees and lawns. Small silver coins can be picked up by reaching out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, look, our administrator seems to have a guest." Besib said. "It seems that he can spend a wonderful night."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is his sister." Sasha said: "Brian Dupont's information I am at I sent it to you a week ago."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, of course, yes..." Besib said, "Do you want some more wine?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blanche DuPont is the sister of Brian Dupont, she is third grade Health, the administrator of the new female dormitory, she and her brother will have dinner every three days, in order to understand each other's situation, but also to solve the other's problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has the same color hair and eyes as her brother, with an amazing chest and sturdy buttocks, long legs and full of strength at the waist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tonight's dessert is Sabah, maybe someone doesn't know that the production is not very complicated, but the requirements for materials and heat are quite high. High snacks - eggs mixed with cream, wine. Pour it on fresh fruit, put it in the oven for a while, and sprinkle with grated lemon zest – from the styling, it's incredibly beautiful, mountain-like red cherries. A few blueberries for embellishment, topped with a volcanic lava-like creamy yellow egg paste, a little dark brown powder, and topped with green lemon balm leaves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best time to eat was the few minutes it had just been taken out of the oven, and now it has cooled completely, but the rich caramel scent still makes Blanche snoring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh. No...damn it, it’s 9:30 in the evening," she complained. "You know I'm losing weight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don’t think about it when you eat." Her brother said nothing, he would never have thought that a girl would have to pay to lose a pound of meat on her belly. How much is the price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A big one," Blanche said, shaking her head. At the same time, I can't wait to pick up my own spoon. "Plus gold wine," she carefully tasted the little tongue that tasted the food: "Where did you get it? This is a fresh black cherries - Those stubborn guys have always scorned the greenhouse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know." Brian answered honestly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At least - which restaurant?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not a restaurant," Brian said. It was a freshman, his father sent him a cherry, and he gave me a snack."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A bribe?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A gift," Brian blamed for a sigh: "And I am sharing it with you - I did give him a very good job, but this is A long time ago."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Long time? Relative to what? Manchester's school day is less than two quarters today." His sister picked up A spoonful of cherries, with a finely lubricated cream, the number of cherries has made the little hills on the spoon look a little crumbling. It was a bit too much compared to Blanche's mouth, but she didn't let the spoon smear on the plate, even if it was extremely subtle, and did not let her lips be covered with greedy evidence. This is a talent that belongs to the DuPont family. They can always behave as if they were getting the most benefit: "What work?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Map."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Blanche pulled the spoon out of his mouth. "How is he doing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It’s a good boy.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Your mission?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you value him very much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just a bit Brian said: "The rest is yours."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you," Blanche said: "You should also choose him for this." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be kidding." Brian said softly but solemnly: "They will be upset."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Chavyists and Nazis, can you not fascist at the party? Or kiss the elders of the elders--(that is what we all know... things)"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Eat it. Blanche."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is really enviable anyway. My side is all girls, but all of them are The room killer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Include you?" Brian said loudly, he was washing more than two dozen dishes in the kitchen: "From my couch Stand up, since you are losing weight, and you ate a half-dish creamy snack five minutes ago, the cherry is very sweet, is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he heard His sister groaned through the sound of the entire room - she deliberately put the footsteps very heavy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have to go back," Blanche poked his head out from the kitchen door: "Help me thank the boy and tell him that I am willing to date him, as the case may be. Depending on his next gift."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you sure I want to tell him that you ate nearly a pound of cherries and cream at a time?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If there is still a pound of cherries and cream," Blanche said, she walked on tiptoe and kissed her brother's face, "Good night."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
