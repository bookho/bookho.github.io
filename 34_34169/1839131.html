			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, I am too tired," Mary glared at the egg on the floor, and Annie looked at her in confusion, then squatted and tried Bring the eggs that have not been completely broken back into the tray - Mary caught her. "I am too tired..." she repeated: "Let it go, leave this alone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But... Mary..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said don't get it!" The sudden increase in voice not only makes Anne Surprisingly widened his eyes, even Mary was shocked by herself: "... well, I said don't get it." She lowered her voice, her fingers pressed hard: "I will handle it, you are now Go back to the room." She paused, and later realized that her tone and words were still between indifference and temper. This is not true, Mary said to herself, you have been with this child for more than a year, she is smart, beautiful, obedient, and sympathetic, you know her, familiar with her, you should not only see one because One or two new neighbors and a new teacher told you about strange things and began to doubt poor Annie? ! - Perhaps as she had thought before, the spice and spinach juice that Anne recommended for her was just a coincidence. Although this child is early, her knowledge can only come from the Internet and the library. She is very likely to know nothing about the harm caused by these two kinds of foods (their benefits have been widely circulated. ) - After all, even before today, even Mary did not know that spices and spinach would be harmful to pregnant women - there must not be a problem. In any case, their names have never appeared on the doctor's food list. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne seems a bit confused, but as she did before, she obeyed without objection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary watched Anne walk out of the kitchen, now she has to hold a hard and big belly to pick up a mess on the ground, this is really not easy, eggs are kind Strange things, it is difficult to get clean, and the remaining parts will soon emit stench, attracting flies and cockroaches. After she had been working for half an hour, she barely let the kitchen floor step on and no longer had a slimy feeling. When she put other things in the refrigerator, glass jar or locker, she found herself after she was properly placed. The back and waist of the back were cold and hard like a marble statue - she pinched the removed wrapping paper in her hand and slowly returned to the kitchen table, sitting straight in the chair. If it is normal, she will let Annie lick her shoulders, but today Mary did not think about it. Her brain is confused and needs to be sorted out... She even wants to give her husband thousands of miles away. Calling, she never thought of him like this, she needs him to be around... but after all, just think about it, because Mr. Kent will be able to get home tomorrow night, and from this day he will take his four weeks of paid maternity leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come back," she said in her heart: "Come back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As she is Said, she is too tired, even sitting in the cold kitchen, hard chair, her whole body, from the eyelids to the fingers are still falling down... she almost fell asleep, but a subtle but Suddenly pulling her movements awakened her from chaos. Under the dim light of the kitchen, Anne's amber eyes shone like gold, and tiny fingers bent into Mary's palm. Mary instinctively first gathered her fingers, and the bumpy touch in her hand reminded her that she raised her hand and found that the wrapper that had been thrown into the trash can was held tightly in her hand. It took a few more seconds for her to understand further - Anne wanted to help herself throw away the rubbish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you," she said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie accepted this little task with joy and joy. After she finished, she ran to the sink and washed her hands. Dry, Mary heard her shoes giggling on the floor tiles. The sound came, she went to the back of Mary, and Mary put two small hands on her shoulders, the little hands with the tide, a bit cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary's body is tight, she controls herself not to escape, this is too stupid, but she can't stop the inexplicable doubts and worries... no matter how diligent the little hands, her body has not been able to Relaxing, Anne seemed to have noticed, she stopped her hand, and then put two white arms over Mary's shoulder, the child's tender, smooth, milky cheeks from the back close to Mary's The neck, the heat she radiated when she spoke, passed over Mary's horns. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "? What do we give kittens" she asked. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; ". ball of yarn," Mary replied dryly. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "What we have to give the dog?" <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "flesh and bones walk." <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; <br /> <br /> & nbsp "What we have to give the little boy?"; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; ". slingshot and the frog" <br /> < br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "we have to give what little girl?" <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; ". innumerable kisses and sweet embrace" <br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie turned out from behind the chair, and she carefully leaned her body to avoid pressing on Mary’s stomach, and she was asking for a reward—Mary hesitated for a moment, reaching out , hugged her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a small game that used to be a favorite of Mary. Dolores, who is more like a little boy in temperament, never plays with her doll or this "Sour" (Dolores) word game until Anne appeared in this home - the head of the foster mother and daughter gently rubbed each other, Mary closed her eyes, she still clearly remembers the first time and the child each other The feeling of hugs and kisses is like a huge, warm, sweet, marshmallow that never melts. She wants to find this feeling again, only to find that she can do nothing. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "Dolores Where?" <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Anne's body slightly shaking a bit: " She went out," she left the foster mother's arms, sweet as usual: "I saw her going out in straight pulley shoes, should be nearby, would you like me to call her?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At about six o'clock, Mary was awakened by a burst of stubborn pain, and she groaned. The eyes grabbed the electronic clock placed on the bedside table and looked at it. He sighed and climbed up from the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She didn’t wear the special pajamas for pregnant women, so she moved into the bathroom step by step, barefoot, and she didn’t turn on the lights, almost closed eyes. I explored the position of the toilet and then threw the bloated body directly onto the toilet seat that was said to be silk. The advantage of not having a male at home is probably only this. She doesn’t have to remember to put down the toilet seat at this time. Sitting on top, holding both hands in the stomach, legs apart, waiting quietly in the dark... but she couldn’t wait until the pain was stronger once, and Mary Kent felt extremely tired and she was eager to go back. Sleeping, but the damn "desire" does not allow her to walk away like this. It repeatedly crushes her rectum, walks around happily inside, and occasionally reveals her head at the "door", but she refuses to come down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary does not know how long it has been waiting for... or how long it has been tortured... when the first hot solid falls from her body She almost shouted "Thank God". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once she opened her head, she couldn't stop, and Mary immediately found in horror that, in addition to those that she needed to abandon... there was a lot of warm liquid pouring from her legs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She struggled to stand up and open the ceiling light in the bathroom, and Mary lowered her head, and her huge stomach made it impossible for her to figure out the situation between her legs. But she could feel something flowing down her legs. She stood trembling with her legs, and the transparent, bright liquid was rapidly forming a flat circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The egg broke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former Dr. Anthony Hopkins, now Claude Mr. Streif was not surprised at the news that Mary Kent’s due date was advanced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, he even had a little curiosity about Mary Kent, this is a healthy and over-extended woman, he is sure that for six consecutive months, nearly two A dozen spices for the main seasoning of three meals a day and a gallon of spinach juice seem to have failed to cause any significant damage to her - at least on the surface, if he remains silent. Or to be exact, if Anne Kent was sensible from the beginning to play tricks on her little cleverness, he was very happy to be a silent observer. Unfortunately, every day, everyone, everywhere, no Less Mary Kent this one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He and Sasha are very fond of here, they don’t like the so-called extra-budgets or what shouldn’t be, if possible, Streiff’s father and son will The 19th district lived for at least four years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This news is what Mrs. Boro told the doctor, because the former must go to the Kent home to look after Anne and Dolores, so that it is from a thousand miles away. Mr. Kent, who came back from the Washington, DC, went directly to the hospital, but she had an urgent report on the summer class of St. Thomas's summer vacation that needed to be dealt with as quickly as possible - now I have to hand it over to Streif, who is in charge of this summer class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Mrs. Boro, Mary Kent’s situation is not very good. She seems to have fainted for a while after the rupture of the amniotic sac. At that time, there were no other people around. When she woke up and called for help, the amniotic fluid was almost exhausted, so even though she had been 37 weeks old, the doctor still decided to perform caesarean section surgery instead of her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At about 11 am, the doctor has already completed the emergency of the Latin class, and Mrs. Boro called again. The follow-up question may be Still need Strap to take over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary’s child has identified hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, partial facial and finger deformities, and other suspicious conditions that require detailed examination to be known - Basically all negative, Mary did not wake up, and Mr. Kent, who had learned the bad news, called. He didn't want Anne and Dolores to come to the hospital. Mrs. Borrow had to stay at the Kent home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Streif put down the phone and agreed to the time and place of the meeting by e-mail and another teacher in the summer Latin class, and then put on a straw hand The basket, into the woods surrounding the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the necessary trimming and weeding, he did not move the garden attached to the house, but in the surrounding woods, he opened a long strip of flat land, There are a lot of plants that you like, and a lot of them are edible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parsley, fennel, mint, rosemary, basil... as Leonardo Disselo Piero da Vinci Description: Peas are suitable for cooking a variety of flavors with vanilla, cheese, sugar and cinnamon, covered with fresh "butiro" cheese slices, duck breast slices and goose slices The rice is rich and delicious, and the red garbanzo soup with sage, rosemary and chopped parsley roots is always just right. The sour and slightly sour grapes are made with sour juice. A sweet, delicious, white-colored marzipan pie is the finishing touch to the whole meal – a real, direct source of Florentine cuisine dating back to the fifteenth century. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
