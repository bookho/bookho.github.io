			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girls gave Besib a badge, very beautiful, round, plexiglass cover, probably only a dollar coin-sized badge face depicting a vivid black The snake, the background is a myriad of delicate green lines that look a bit like long strips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishb held it in his hand, and at the moment he walked into the public aisle of the dormitory, he placed the badge in the corner of the stairs in an extremely natural and easy way. A non-recyclable waste bin in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want it?" Richard asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have already received their gratitude." Both Besib and Sasha will not easily bring things that others have given them: "It is already I am, so how to deal with it should also follow me." He noticed that Richard seems to have something to say: "What is the important thing about this stuff?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Nothing matters," Richard said. "Just here... I saw it before."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it famous?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, not very famous..." Richard said: "Someone has sent me an invitation for this organization."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Organization?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Protection of nature and animals."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No doubt," Besib sarcastically said: "The Vatican's priests should be wary, this word is about to replace Wanfu my master."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard Shame Laughing, he was still dull when he laughed. Yu, "I haven't reached that level yet - but we... should be considerate, how to say it - when they claim to be an environmentalist, they can often... get a lot of benefits - at the very least, others, I feel that they are loving, kind and amiable, whether they are studying or working, they can get..." He shrugged: "Additional extra points."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Are you an environmentalist?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I like animals,” Richard said. “But I also eat meat.” His face emerged A pleasant look that is indescribable, specifically. It’s like someone stuffing an expired fat in his mouth: “I’m not a vegetarian.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib really wants to let him go. Manchester's new dormitory has a fairly wide staircase, which can accommodate a dozen people at the same time. He dreams that Hopkins's roommate rolls over and rolls off the ladder. His neck, his mouth open, his eyes staring at the ceiling. But he just gave a gesture: "Then the badge - the organization it represents... Do you understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know much, Richard said: "They seem... there is a little bit of radicality, I think."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To what extent is radical?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, bombing one or two whaling ships, etc.," Sasha said, turning the laptop screen over to Besib. He can get hundreds of times more information than Richard gives: "Some people say they have a relationship with the infamous terrorist organization 'Earth Animal Liberation Front', and more directly, they are born out of the 'Earth Animal Liberation Front. 'There are two key members who have been released on parole for five years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because of the kidnapping and murder," Besib said: "I am at Poseidon." The island has also heard about it, they are a group of unruly madmen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They have members who died in prison," Sasha said: "There will be a dissatisfaction The old girl is stripped of the lively shredded squid - the person who can do this... he should be very clear about what kind of end he will have."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But there are two more..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because they were injured at the time, they were not able to participate in the resistance. They have money at home and can ask a good lawyer to prove that they are just two innocent deceived." Sasha turned the computer back: Moreover, the real culprit is still good. Safely, comfortably stay in your own home and enjoy the care and attention of your family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Computer Did you say this?” Besib bent down and carefully searched for every letter on the screen. "I didn't see it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, this is not the information that can be found on the Internet," Sasha said carelessly: "I know. Because I am the party."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you one of those children?" Besib quickly made a simple counter-calculation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Yes,” said Little Hopkins. “I know more than anyone knows. It includes Kimila is the Greeks Somitre.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "I know the name," Besib said. "They said that he had already died. The criminal borrowed his name, and perhaps he was as good as he was. - Kay... Mira is also a The abilities."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he rarely saw a confused look on Little Hopkins’ face: "I don't know," he said frankly. "Kemira can change into Syrenes Somitre, this change is not limited to the epidermis and muscles, blood, bone marrow, organs, nerves will change, that is, if Kimila is turning into Greek When Reynolds went to bed with a woman, the woman was likely to be pregnant - this is a good ability, but I also saw - Kemira's ability is not from childhood, this ability ... is someone else Presented to her, she moved a secret minor surgery without the family and friends knowing it. Let her be her loved one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!" Besib shouted: "You didn't tell me?!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought you knew it already," Sasha said. "Did your father not tell you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"When did he know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before we went to the island." Sasha looked at the unhappy friends with a smile: "You never mention this, I thought you were a good old man like a Madonna... well, to avoid hurting my weak little heart."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Your heart is full of steel teeth and teeth." Besib said with a sigh of relief: "The inside is filled with sulfuric acid and mercury."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I apologize," Sasha said. "But I really don't know you don't know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A Martini, I will forgive You," Besib threatened: "I know that you have hidden wine. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It does. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They shared a bottle of 5 ounces of gin and a tablespoon of absinthe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
