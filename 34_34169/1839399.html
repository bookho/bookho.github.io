			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Celegal. The disintegrated * is distributed throughout the house, some out of the body, just like the right hand from the previous days, some are connected Through the tough, nerves and fascias like wires. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Andreas licked her lips and retracted her legs back into the frame of the chandelier. Under the frame was a cylindrical strip of meat that swayed in the air. It looks like the most common tube sponge. Its tip is purple like a tube sponge, with nails, open ends, small tentacles, full of corrosive acid, purple along The outer wall of the tube is gradually reduced, and it can be seen that they are just blood vessels. The chaos is like the blood vessels of the basket of wool that have been smashed and crawling in the pink skin with healthy color. They are all clearly visible. As for the skin, since Chegara has eaten himself fat, his skin is not so smooth anymore - he can simply go to the advertisement for skin care products. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A round dice emerged from this beautiful, sly skin, a few seconds ago it was small, after a few seconds It is so big that it can't be ignored. It grows up to the size of an ancient silver coin in an instant. Then, several blood vessels that have passed through it rupture, and the purple-black blood flows out and is immediately absorbed by the skin. Hope Dr. Kings and Old Andreana saw it - a tiny crack was created on the scorpion, a black crack, which stretched to both sides, sparse, bristled, sparse, hard gray hair turned from the inside of the crack Come out, finally, it smashed and opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cechal!" Old Andreas yelled excitedly, and Dr. Hopkins kept a cautious silence, he was right. Just at the moment. More eyes appeared, they were like foam coming out of boiled rice porridge, one next to one, the big ones were as big as the human palms, and the small ones - they were densely tied together. It’s like holding a small, lively tan mushroom – two thick, sausage-colored lips that open in the jungle of the eye, the teeth touching the eyelashes, and the fat tongue sticking out of the gap between the black holes, Whiteson’s The teeth are placed over the bones on the surface of the skin, with the tip facing the ceiling. There are one hundred or two hundred, in total, more than the number that humans should have. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A young man falls lightly on Dr. Hopkins’s side, his face is arrogant, *on the upper body, the bat-like flesh from his The shoulder blade is extended. Four wings, two big and two small, very strong, can easily bring up his skinny body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was cut out of a secret private prison (or a collector's house). No one knows it. He only knows that he is good at killing with that tongue. His tongue can reach the longest five. Feet, it can penetrate the bullet-proof glass of the president's car - not that he has this brilliant experience. However, he did rely on this to kill a lot of vigilant big men, by the way, he was a ballet dancer and a semi-public man before he had the ability. He usually takes the initiative to take off the light before entering the special gold room, but no one can guess that he can hide the weapon in the body before a lucky one escapes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They immediately smelled the smell of the barbecue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A flame burns the meat that covers the door, and the charred scent is sweet and thick, causing the index finger to move, and the meat is dissatisfied. sound. The middle-aged man in the room took the opportunity to jump out of the hole that had been boiled. He cleverly used his own flame to clear the way. There was no chance for the meat that was full of anger and appetite. The place he passed was almost the same as the enlarged oven - which reminded him of his mother. His mother is a lazy woman. The oven in the house is never cleaned. It has been a long time. The bottom layer of the oven, the sides and the top surface are like the floor in front of him. The walls and ceilings are full of thick grease. The mixture with coke felt like it was inserted into unrefined oil. He was often kept inside when he was very young. Later he grew up, and his mother put him in the refrigerator. He was in the black hole. The first flame was lit in the refrigerator. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fire is really a good thing, and later he learned how to stand far and can also ignite the human body, although the banknotes and checkbooks will be burned, but gold, platinum And diamonds will be left behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two men of Poseidon Island followed him, his nose against his back, and the flame surrounded them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meat followed him, and his back heel was full of corrosive saliva. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides them, it’s a woman who can escape her life. She has an unremarkable face. Like many people in the organization, she is just a different person. Capable, no criminal record, Chegarer sees her only because her hearing is very outstanding, she can not only hear the slight sound of distant places, but also accurately identify its type, orientation and distance, Old Andrea Na has strengthened some aspects of training, and now she can detect the sound of someone pulling a trigger insurance a mile away, which makes her sleep quality decline, but it becomes more useful - she was the first to find strange The piece of meat - it whispered over the ceiling of her room, she escaped from the room and ran to the path of Dr. Anthony Hopkins, whom she believed to be reliable and gentle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Hopkins immediately woke up Old Andriana, and when they returned to the hallway again, the meat had occupied half of the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are they?" asked the young man. He is already a bit in his heart, but he doesn't want that name to pop out of his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doctor turned around and placed his index finger on his lips, and the young man immediately closed his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The criminals are afraid of him, although Dr. Anthony Hopkins seems to be a lovely and amiable gentleman, but some people are not at risk Loudly proclaiming or wielding a fist can be seen in the world, especially for people like them - the beast is the most sensitive to the beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the young man was in prison, he also saw one or two guys who were said to have eaten the same kind, but he didn’t feel that they were terrible at all, but they felt that they were all It’s a coward. They threatened and intimidated others by eating one or two children or women, but they were so scared and pissed off when they were bitten off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mouth in the eyeballs moved, "Andriana." It shouted in a low voice, full of emotions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Celegal?" Old Andriana asked her head down, her feet stopped shaking for a while, and several tentacles quickly and quietly Going up, stalking her feet violently - the woman hiding behind Hopkins endured a gasp - the tentacles were only as thin as the wool thread, but the strength was big enough to bring the old Andriana The whole child turned over. The chandelier swayed violently and slammed loudly - the old mother of Besib showed the courage and strength of a man on the island of Poseidon, and she stretched out a foot between the electric and the flint. Entangling the chain of chandeliers, the metal chain smashed the bare skin, and the blood crawled down the loose legs of her skin, crawling into her loose pajama pants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fresh blood is irritating to the meat, and they are very inspiring, as reflected in the wave-like surface and more tentacles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They still don’t dare to touch Anthony Hopkins and a small area around it, but Old Andriana is not, she’s just The gun was also lost in the raid (although it didn't make much use), an old woman who was upside down, bare-handed, the tentacles under her head were happily like being invited to a free barbecue, and other tentacles were busy hitting the window. There are walls, and people who are still alive smell a thick smell of acetic acid. "They want to go out." The young man said that the glass of the floor-to-ceiling windows is emitting the sound of Ziz, and every place in Chegal’s residence is safe. The reinforcement is the same, the glass is the same, but it is obviously softening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Andriana?" Dr. Hopkins looked up and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay!" Old Andriana shouted: "That's it, let's do it!" She gasped and broke a wish to dig The tentacles out of her eyes: "May the Virgin bless you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doctor went down halfway, he reached out and the meat panicked back, but it was too late. The ghoul's slender and pale fingers touched them, and the highly active special metabolic components were injected into the flesh from the small spikes protruding from the non-human fingertips. This stuff can be filled up if explained in detail. A whole encyclopedia of marine biotoxins, so we only need to know that it is a highly toxic and rapidly spreading alkaloid, it can block the conduction of nerves, that is, as long as it is used properly, it is a kind It is the best anesthetic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Hopkins was ready to use this five minutes ago, but Old Andriana disagreed, if Chegar is still an individual, I mean It is safe to use this toxin when it comes to the basic shape of human beings, but now that Chegal has become a house of meat, who knows whether this natural anesthetic will kill him or scrap it directly? Somewhere in him? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can be delayed, Chegaler. Bisangdi may eat half a Poseidon Island, maybe more? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meat is quiet down one by one, climbing in the window, the tentacles on the wall and the old Andriana are hanging like soft hair, coiled Together, it looks like a snake group, more like a noodle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Andriana got rid of the life-saving metal chain, she jumped from the chandelier and boldly stepped on the meat that was sleeping like a baby. The meat under the bare feet is elastic, smooth and warm, with a slight tremor and undulation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One eye looked up from the gap in her toes, and then she saw a mouth, normal except for the long place, not too bad for others. Mouth, then she heard the familiar voice: "What's wrong with this? Andriana?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(To be continued)(To be continued)<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ps: Work ing - don't say it, it's all tears - two tomorrow or three more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
