			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Qiz Carson?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha said he moved his body slightly Let his shadow not completely cover the girl in front of him - Chiz Carson gave him the impression that he still stayed for more than two years ago. The pale and thin is like a heavy paper-cut person. Addict, but now she looks good and healthy, and that painful and long experience is like a piece of videotape that has been completely cut off and cleaned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of Poseidon, Chiz was almost as tall as Sasha, and in Orlosa, her height did not even exceed Sasha’s shoulders— - Of course, the boy who coincides with puberty is growing up almost day and night, but the best growth period of Chiz is indeed destroyed by those terrible drugs - and now, she only needs to raise her head a little. Kissing to the lips of Sasha, she is very close, exudes the unique aroma of the girl, even in such a dark place, her skin is still like a pearl, or the moon is as white and clean, she is still a bit thin, but No longer so thin, so scary, whether it is the buttocks, the chest is full, and the limbs are very energetic, otherwise she just can not run so fast, there is no way to rely on one to weigh one hundred and fifty The pound man pulled it straight up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You look much better." Sasha said sincerely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And you are as dazzling as ever." Chiz said that there is no falsehood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guy lying on the floor suddenly shouted loudly, interrupting their confrontation, Chiz put away a smile, walked facelessly, kicked with a heel His face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl who was pressed under his body stood in the hands of Sasha, and she was angry and scared, licking her lips, unable to speak, two The shoes on the soles of the feet did not know where to be kicked in the struggle. She did not wear them. The bare thighs were all traces of red marks drawn by the grass stems, and the mouth was open. A nipple fell out, and the pendant of the necklace was picked up behind the neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brian Dupont flies past Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he stood in front of Hopkins breathlessly, he looked a little embarrassed, and he kept his neat hair in the dance hall in a fierce I fell a few times in the run. Covering his eyes - in low light, the dark brown iris looks black and very pure black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the boy and looked at the girl again. The matter was very clear. The fourth-grade student with linen hair frowned, very fast, barely enough to see, and then silenced for a while. "I think I have to thank you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was just a little surprised." Chiz Carson responded politely: "Please tell me, I didn't interrupt some kind of ritual - just like the first grade boy was thrown into the water - the first grade girl should be harassed at the welcome party?" Considering the girl around, she carefully selected A less irritating word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't want to justify this bastard," Brian said. "But this is really not a place for conversation, and I think a cup of black tea with brandy." Is it urgently needed? What do you say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QiZi looked at the girl. Sasha did not speak, and they did not have the right to make any decisions for a victim. Brian had already thought of this. He smiled at the girl with a real dilemma and pleading. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl is hesitant, she is trying to punish the daring who wants to rape herself, but she is also very clear. She did not suffer substantial harm, he was attempted, or just started, she was stopped, she did not know whether the two who are new to themselves would testify for themselves - can apply to Manchester Students are not a fool, just a few tens of seconds. She thought of a lot of things - even if the hybrid lying on the ground is just an ordinary person (for example, his parents are not in those who donate 240 million people), Manchester will not be happy in the welcome week. At the end of the day, I had to see my school and a scandal linked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She will stay here for at least four years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her parents are not in that two hundred and four million, they are just two mediocre small staff, her grades are very good. Others can't say that it's great, but being able to apply to Manchester can only be said to be a miracle - even she doesn't know how to impress the interviewer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brian took off his coat and put it on the girl, wearing a young male smell and temperature clothes became the last weight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go to me first," Brian said naturally. "I have a medical kit, hot black tea, and brandy... well - last Please do not go out. Hopkins, Carson, can you come together?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
