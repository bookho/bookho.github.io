			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Carson left Tang’s room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He met two boys on the stairs, looking like fourteen and five years old, one of them is a little thin, the kind that is growing like crazy The pale blond hair was licked behind the ear. When both sides passed by, he looked up and looked at Carson. Carson saw a memorable face, not only handsome, but also some others. Something, Carson can't say it for a while, but he believes in his instincts that the boy reminds him of a small octopus covered in a sapphire blue ring. (Note 1)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn't like this boy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other boy is as dark as the shadow cast by the previous boy. It is like a little stallion. He stands on the side of the stairs. With the body, I looked at the adult man who hurriedly ran past them with great interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you want John Carson to do? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After about half an hour, the boys screamed and jumped into the large bath made of stone. The bath was steaming, the white mist was lingering, and the bath was big. Enough for two boys to swim inside, they splashed water on each other, took turns to sneak into the pool, and washed away the salt and exhaustion left in the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishb makes his body float and erect his toes on the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marine biologists and environmentalists and thugs have never worn a pair of trousers - the mobs have a nose that rivals the sharks. They can smell the smell of ink from a ten-dollar bill a thousand miles away; they never let go of any chance of taking huge profits, and they never use any kind of violent means, as long as they can achieve their goals - nowadays The eyes of Masoye are no longer limited to casinos and drugs. They are also happy to undertake projects that others (ordinary people) cannot complete under normal conditions, such as a natural oil field hidden in the original wetlands, or It is a nuclear power pollution treatment contract, and it is the relocation and transformation of a dilapidated urban area. Of course, you can't expect the mobs to work in obedience, those who are nosy, the inconveniences of the guys (the environmentalists), the irrelevant calls, or the social ethics, institutions, and even the social ethics, systems, and even The legal orders have not yet been tough enough to touch their stout nerves. They poured cement into the swamp, stripped the vegetation, built roads, set up dormitories, shops, airstrips, and erected the tower on the nest of the black-billed gull; in the middle of the night, sneaked the nuclear pollution waste into the truck and transported it to the ordinary Garbage disposal centers, and other domestic garbage will be buried in the grass; in the old town of Jingui, not only human beings are driven away, but all the things that do not meet the developer’s intentions have to get out of their construction sites in a limited time. The bang was booming, the old house was pushed down, the factory was built, and the banknotes rolled in. Who cares if a certain number of years will become a real hell at your fingertips? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before being attacked by environmentalists for the first time, the mobs probably never thought that birds, mice, and insects would have such a large proportion in their lives—they had to assign an objective number of fighters and lawyers. Dealing with those who are angry and indignant, it is very annoying. There are still a large number of non-negligible status and identity backgrounds. The mob can't break their skulls with their bats, and they can't dig their eyes. It’s not possible to pinch your fingers with pliers, it will cause trouble – they have tried kidnapping and intimidation, but the results are minimal, who can understand the stuff? They can look at the eggs... or the ants' eggs more than the eggs between their legs! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A group of damn, unreasonable, extreme, and extortionate terrorists!" Besib had heard the head of the division complaining so angry . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, he is still very curious, especially when Chegal is showing up in the face of John Carson, who only has to face himself. Talents will be tolerant and kind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of this is justified, and John Carson has nothing to watch in the eyes of the leader of the mob. "Tang" Chegarer is concerned about his surname, Carson, this surname is not common in the Western Confederation, but it can not be said to be rare, and the Carson family from John Carson happens to be the Western Confederation. One of the top ten financial giants, the family business - the main insurance industry, investment industry, loan guarantee industry, investment banking business, venture capital business, in this respect, they have extremely rich experience, extensive and in-depth context, it seems The unskilled skilled manpower and the most valuable and solid credibility - Chekal’s almost maddening thing, everyone knows that "Masoye" has almost astronomical figures and illegal funds need to be legalized. The money has been increasing and has never stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib knows that Chegal is working on developing this talent and has acquired several very good medium-sized pure financial holding companies, but Compared with Carson, it is simply a giant and a goblin - Chegal is a greedy old thing, the olive seedlings with good growth momentum are very good, but he wants to have thick and thick branches, fruitful, and will be able to Picking mature forests for oil extraction. For this, the old Chegara has cast a lot of golden bait, but unfortunately, the characters who can become financial giants will definitely not be short-sighted idiots, and regardless of those illegal businesses that are extremely prone to people and resentment and even exclusion... ...even if "Masoye" is as clean as a newborn baby, they will not trade with a "Tang" - a literally "person", the appetite of the hard-to-eat beast It is impossible to check and balance by law and ethics. Who knows if it will swallow the former guides after getting familiar with it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the reason. Although the funds of “Masoye” are also continually seduce the stomachs of the big brothers, they are even more afraid that they will be killed by the tempting cake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John Carson appeared in front of Chegal at this time. He is one of the latest generations of the Carson family who can really get rid of the family’s shelter and control. Guy, he rarely went home when he was an adult. He never intervened and intervened in his family business. He was immersed in a variety of anemones and octopuses. He married at the age of 30. This marriage lasted only two years. During this period, as a member of a fanatical non-violent Greenpeace organization, he devoted 90% of his time and energy to the rescue work of a giant whale. "Obviously, he is more willing to sleep with a fish." The wife, also his cousin (Bishib suspected this was a compromise) said so and proposed a divorce. John Carson’s lack of attention to marriage and family caused dissatisfaction among the family’s elders. The family no longer provided convenience and funds for his career, but this did not make the stubborn John Carson bow his head. He left the original The university, who found a job at a marine biology research institute, also worked as a TV host for the audience, introducing the various marine life to the audience. The latter work gave him great inspiration. In recent years, he has been planning and Preparing for the shooting of a large-scale natural documentary – a luxurious and gorgeous vision, John Carson wants to shoot the ocean, professional boats, professional equipment, professional personnel, on the sea, in the sea, with the latest electronic camera Technology, explore this deep and rich mysterious world as never before, capture the shape of various marine life, and live them in a human touch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not easy. In addition to the courage and knowledge necessary, money is indispensable. If you want to shoot such a documentary, you must have more than ten adventures. Teams, each team must have experienced explorers and photographers, the time is long - nature is not an actor, it will never pose, waiting for you to shoot, rare good shots are always fleeting, you can not hope On the illusory good luck, you can only prepare well, and then wait... If you put it fifteen years ago, this is of course no problem, John Carson cherishes his ideals, but does not want to repeat the same mistakes for the ideal. And he can't be sure that the film shot with the strength and money of the family will eventually be distorted—the people of the Carson family, both the master of money and the slave of money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John Carson has spent the rest of his life preparing for his wish. He did not expect to get a generous promise here, "Tang" Cheka Le is willing to bear about hundreds of millions of dollars in shooting costs for him, and all he needs is an opportunity to contact the Carson family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether it is possible to reach an agreement has nothing to do with him, can he go further and has nothing to do with him, all he has to do is make a phone call, and then 500 million yuan will be credited to his account in stages, no more than a year, he can hurt. It’s so fast that I chase my own bluebird without any scruples. It seems that Chegar's request is not so much. "That is just a small amount of money." "Tang" said this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John Carson knows that it’s really just a small amount of money. For the leader of Masaoye, the annual federal drug trade in the Western Continent is 500 billion yuan a year. Above the yuan, the net profit is as high as 20%. No one knows how much "Tang" has a share. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t know how long he stood on the soft carpet, his sweat went down to the knee like the rain of the rainforest, his eyes were blurred He said that he was weak and weak, but he still knew that he eventually refused the "Tang" request. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes John Carson really doesn’t know why he has such a big courage, maybe he shouldn’t neglect the warning given by the family from the beginning. "Don" is not a good person who is rumored by the people of Poseidon. Even if it is, it is not for him, but he is still here. He is stupid and lucky. He is very wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he can't continue to go wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you think?" Sasha did not answer the question of Besib. He learned how his friends floated on the water, even if they could not be exposed to the sun every day. The color of his skin is still very light, almost shining in the dim light, the sanded arm is back, on the warm stone: "The man?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Besib thought for a moment, "He is a little unhappy," frowning, with vertical stripes in his eyebrows: "Frustrated, and a little regret," the eyes drooped, the chin's skin was wrinkled, the eyes were Looking down, I turned to the left for a while, and turned to the right for a while, as if I was constantly reminiscing about something, "disgusting." "Anger." The nostrils are wide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And fear." Sasha added, after a pause, he continued: "I think he has angered your father, and he himself I know this very well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Uh huh." Besib said, he slammed near Sasha, his arm around his neck: "How do you say ?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
