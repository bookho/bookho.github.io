			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha’s roommate is exactly the opposite of Besib’s roommate. From appearance to character, he is a pale-skinned man with pale yellow twilight hair. Wrapped in an oval skull, it looks like a painted pot lid. The eyes are small and slender. The upper and lower eyelids are swollen like a big cry, and he wears a black frame. Stupid glasses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He arrived earlier than Sasha, but the luggage was not opened. He asked Little Hopkins for advice and asked him to pick the wardrobe first. After the desk and bed, I began to sort out the part of my room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to post some pictures," he said, with a strong western accent, while obsessively observing this from behind the heavy glass pieces It is a beautiful young roommate who came out from the 19th century painter John William Waterhouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little Hopkins looked at him, Manchester’s school for these first-time children to consider very well, in order not to let them destroy the walls of the dormitory To meet their individual needs, they pre-installed cork boards that almost filled the entire wall, just above their beds, so that students could freely stick them on them or pin them to their favorite Posters, records, notes and reminders, and graffiti created by yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first Sasha thought he wanted to talk to himself about whether he could use his cork board - most likely, his roommate was a poster collector, or Someone's loyal followers, that little cork board is not enough to carry all his enthusiasm and collections - it doesn't matter, Sasha Hopkins doesn't like posters, and doesn't like to show his work, more I don't need a note to remind myself what to do... but when he looked up, he noticed that the room board's cork board was still empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you want to put a picture on your own board," Sasha said: "You don't have to ask for my opinion at all."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before, I mean, my high school roommate didn't like my paintings very much," he said. "He said that those things would make him creepy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it a poster for horror movies?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," roommate shook his head: "I just painted some of the paintings." Child."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
