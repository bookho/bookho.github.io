The ability to hear the outside is not so good - as usual, they are in the elevator, waiting for the professionals to rescue - but there are explosions everywhere, and possibly in case of fire Sitting and waiting is not a good idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," Sasha said: "Let's try to climb up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The hall door was stuck."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe it has been opened." Sasha asked if anyone would hold a triangular key to open the hall door. There is too much hope, but his power is far more than ordinary people. Just give him some time, he can open the hall door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Would you like someone to give you a foot?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Give me a place Just fine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chitz, Lor and Dr. Smith all gave up their position, and they stood next to the corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The handrail of the elevator is vertical and elliptical. The polished light is bright and bright, but it does not prevent the sand from standing firmly. He has grown up to five now. Feet nine inches, the same as the average height of adult males in the Western continent, but it is expected that he will grow a few inches in the future. This height allows him to find and push the escape port at the top of the elevator effortlessly. He grabs with his fingers. Stay on the edge of the escape, and use your abdomen to easily hang yourself up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hall door still maintains a slightly open seam, but Sasha knows that this is not "stuck," but the hall door originally reserved one inch. The left and right gaps, the elevator companies do this, so he can't count on finding the things that are stuck and then smoothly open the hall door - the door is harder to open than the car door, especially now that he only Can rely on his own fingers instead of machinery - he stood at the top of the car and checked the hall door. The latest design, the key to the door will be as strong as the welding on the track. If he is an ordinary person, then there is almost no need to do this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the second explosion came, all of Sasha Hopkins' attention was almost on the door of the hall where there was already a sign of looseness - his feet were empty without warning. Fingers slid across the hall door, and a sharp-cut part cut his palm. In less than a second, Sasha made the decision. He let go of his hand and fell down. Of course he could continue to hang in the elevator shaft, and perhaps had the opportunity to open the hall and climb out. But there are three people below. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a failure in the elevator tongs, the car slammed down a whole layer, and the seven-story illuminated passage swayed in front of them, and then It is a rough gray cement layer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Much better than a few seconds, they don’t have to worry about the door now. Thanks to Mr. Martin, the seven-story hall door has been opened by him. Now they just climb up and Sasha climbs up first, then he can pull others one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third wave of attacks that was only a little slower than his thoughts came, and everyone heard the "啵" that was like when the cans were opened. It was only a few hundred times larger than the former—the bottom of the car suddenly bulged upwards and slammed down—the ground they stepped on suddenly became a black hole full of fangs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The metal fragments are splashing around. Shot, glass fragments spilled from the top. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only half a frightened shout, when you can only hang in the air against your own arm. It is very difficult for you to shout. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing that fell was Lor, Dr. Smith wanted to pull her, but was dragged down together, and Sasha caught Dr. Smith’s coat, he Hanging on the edge of the cracked hole, the other side of the elevator armrest hung with Chiz Carson. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The armrest is fixed to the car wall by two screws. In the previous test, a square "foot" for fixing the screw was welded off the handrail rod. The slippery, low-headed pole couldn’t catch it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chiz Carson stretched out his arms and tried to hang himself more securely. She couldn’t wait to turn her head to observe the situation in Sasha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not good, as we said before, Sasha is not holding the rose, but the thorn on the rose, the sharp, sharp metal stabbed him. The palms, wrists and arms of the palms, the place where he hooked, had only one cigarette case size, and he relied on such a point to drag about 5,000 pounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't move." Dr. Smith said to Lor, his voice trembled, apparently just pretending to be calm, with several cables hanging in the hoistway, but they were far from Lol and Smith... their arms had their present It’s twice as long to get it, and they can’t see it, but he also knows that the person above can’t hold it for a long time, he can’t see it, but he can feel the warm liquid flowing down his neck, he’s It’s so familiar – it’s the blood of humans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha couldn’t help but cursed, the metal was bending. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let them go," Chiz’s voice echoed throughout the elevator shaft: "Sasha, let them go!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No!" Lol panicked and shouted: "Please!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't talk!" Dr. Smith Hard to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you let go, then he didn’t have to jump down with it, Sashasi said, he estimated that the hospital’s single-storey height is about 15 Around the feet, they have just passed seven floors, so there is about a hundred feet below. This height is enough to kill half a dozen ordinary people, but for the abilities, it is not fatal, and there are two feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Climb up, Chiz." Sasha said calmly: "Climb up the seventh floor, find the fire box, then drag the water pipe out and find a Put a knot, fix it, put it down - don't say no, I know you can do it - I can still hold it... at least five minutes, don't waste time - you don't want me to fall, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last sentence played a decisive role, and Chiz tried to climb up, and the three people in the air had a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The command of Sasha is correct. There is always a fire box on the side of the elevator. It took only three minutes. The gray water pipe hangs down the elevator with a heavy joint. well. Lor immediately seized it, and then Dr. Smith, as Sasha had envisioned at first, he climbed up and pulled the two men up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The six floors are also in a panic and dust, and the zd that exploded here is no less than the nine floors. Doctors, nurses, patients and others are crowded in the safe passage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The stairs are broken." Those who placed zd deliberately put a few more in the elevator and the stairs, the lights are broken, a few The individual turned on the light on the mobile phone and the twisted steel bars protruded from the rubble, and they poked straight toward them like the withered branches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before standing is a strong middle-aged man. He suddenly screamed and stepped back a few big steps. The domino effect caused a small chaos in the whole group. A fat-looking woman moved her feet awkwardly. She bumped into two people, among them. The first is Sasha. He was singularly slow, and when the huge elbow hit his ribs, Little Hopkins's face showed a lime-like paleness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the crowds at the mouth of the passage were evacuated, they saw what made people so scared, it was plants. Tens of vines thicker than the same kind of vines stick out from the stairway of the black hole, and entangled with steel bars and concrete blocks to form a green steep slope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this?" Someone asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Red vines," one doctor replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now is not a joke," the person questioning is very angry: "What I want to know is..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We may have encountered a superhero," the middle-aged man standing at the forefront is eager to try. "He is saving us." He took a step forward and stepped into the middle of the lush foliage. The vines were not removed or showed an attempt to hang him. It looked very solid and he stepped on the stairs without much effort. "I am here." The middle-aged man shouted loudly and shone up with the light of the mobile phone. "You can try it down. The plants... are very dense, don't worry about being pinched," he said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We can wait," said the fat woman. "Someone will come to save us soon."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are on the sixth floor. It takes only five minutes to complete these stairs," the doctor said. While listening carefully, sideways: "The explosion is still going on, it's not safe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In case the stairs below are also broken?" said the woman. She scanned other people and apparently wanted to say that some people would like to wait with her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then we pray that this superhero will do things all the time." The doctor said that he picked up a patient in a wheelchair and the nurse was helping him. There were not many patients who could not move freely. Everyone was willing to help. They sent it down - Lor is a bit strange. Sasha Hopkins is standing still. He is very young and very energetic. Think about it, he can catch two people who are falling, but Immediately, she was ashamed, because she saw the bloody hand – not only, but when he caught them, his muscles and joints were also greatly hurt, as long as there was a little medicine and life. Common sense can be guessed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha They are the last ones, and Lor’s attention to his hand reveals that he is still relieved when he can hold the vines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one noticed that there was a tail in the retreat team, Boa. Douglas followed them to run and climb, and he summoned the vines after he left. After three seconds, it turns yellow and becomes brittle. As for the future, there will be no one who wants to borrow or just climb on it. He doesn't care. If it is not Catherine who ordered him to protect, he is also in the team. I am willing to go back to the dormitory to take a shower earlier. There is too much gray here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I saw the sky again, someone cried. Fortunately, Manchester Hospital is just a private hospital with a research nature. The patient has only 80 patients, and the explosion has not affected the main structure of the hospital building. The evacuation time was also abundant, and the doctors and nurses robbed almost all the patients and the necessary first-aid items - an inflatable emergency medical shed formed on the vast lawn, two unfortunate guys, one broken glass I opened my neck and a support frame that fell from the sky pierced the chest - they didn't need treatment, but rescue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't you go?" Boa. Douglas asked carelessly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said," Boa. Douglas caught Sasha The shoulders, the light blue eyes were full of gloom, his hand touched the inside of the lambskin coat, and suddenly grabbed the dagger-like stainless steel piece - it was deeply embedded in the belly of Sasha: "Are you ready to let it cut off something and bring it back to your good dad for dinner?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the injury suffered during the seven-story zd explosion. It hurts and is a bit dangerous, but in front of others. Especially in front of strangers, Sasha Hopkins does not like to expose himself too much. He only needs to endure for ten minutes, and he can find a hidden corner to get this thing out. The next step is different. It is time for the capable person to behave differently from the self-healing ability of ordinary people - Boa seized the "dagger". After stirring awkwardly, I pulled it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha Hopkins couldn't help but scream, and what made him feel bad was that he was gently stabbed in addition to the vicious agitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He only persisted for a few seconds and fainted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boa. Douglas caught him. "Sleep, baby." He whispered sarcastically: "Don't let your aunt worry." Then he pushed him to Dr. Smith. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is one more!" After a brief horror, Dr. Smith, who responded, shouted, "Need a stretcher."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned around: "We haven't been able to detect it - he saved us and ran six floors with us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is different."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boo. Douglas said. "Do you need to look at this?" He handed the piece of stainless steel over. "Look at this depth - he is getting rid of it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, another group of people are busy on the second floor of Manchester. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If someone asks what is the most valuable thing in a medical institution or research institute - no, of course not the cold instruments and equipment, except those In addition to the confidential level of information and research results, the most likely to leave a researcher's heart is only the slices and samples. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who entered the heart of Manchester by the chaos caused by the explosion came to the latter. There are a lot of things to take away, the time it takes to carry samples (and have to keep them in a specific container) and the time it takes to disassemble the motherboard is distracting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We can put fire here," one member complained. It didn't take long for him to enter the "Twelve Wings", his family was good, and there was a pair of parents who loved him. Doing nothing all day, the "Twelve Wings" with violent tendencies are one of the most important sustenances he has found. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then we can't get the money." The leader said perseveringly: "We can use this money to save whales and monkeys. Isn't that good?" Use their weapons to deal with them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are not many members who participated in this event. They know less and can say. No one except the leader knows what they really want to do – wait until all the things they need to move out. The leader placed two suitcases under a table and pressed the start button. Unlike the movie, there is no timer or red light. Only a small green light like a sesame indicates that it has been activated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The members around the leader couldn’t help but lick their lips: "This can blow up the entire hospital."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"We have given them time," said the leader. "They are able to evacuate all the people, oh, those exceptions." He slammed his head and pointed his chin to several research and security personnel: "Required The sacrifice, we are helpless - but now it should be empty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Brian knows that his behavior is very rash, very stupid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their elevators were stuck on the second floor, but they were not affected by the explosion. A small explosion in the corridor distracted them, and the ceiling poured down buried him. He was not injured (slightly scratched and bruised on his knees), it took a lot of effort to struggle, he When the broken mineral wool board climbed out, there was no one in the corridor. He went down the safe passage and ran into the reception hall. At this moment, the second floor of the underground, the real explosion occurred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entrance to the glass door is only a few feet away from him, the concrete canopy fell off, and the steel bar implanted in the building body pulled it, it A triangle is formed on the ground, and the gaps on both sides are not flat, but it is more than enough for one to drill out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Brian was trying to do this, he heard a cry for help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned his head, there was gray everywhere, the undamaged sprinkler system was still working, and the air was filled with ominous stench. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The place not far from him is a pillar that should have been dumped. The reason why it cannot be said to be "fallen" is because someone is supporting It. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a support column with a diameter of about three feet. The inside is reinforced concrete, and the outside is a beautiful cloud-shaped marble hanging on the angle iron shelf. You can crush a blue whale, but one person can hold it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
