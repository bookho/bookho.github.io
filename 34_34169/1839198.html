			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John Carson’s funeral was both grand and boring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His younger brother published a well-documented obituary in several mainstream newspapers, the close-knit of the Kason family and more close friends, banks and investment companies. The competent cadres of the Institute of Marine Biology and Greenpeace received envelopes with black borders, which informed them of this unfortunate news, indicating the time, place and approximate number of participants in the funeral. There are traffic maps and contact numbers on the back. There are two contact numbers, one man and one lady. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The funeral was held in one of the oldest churches in the Carson family’s home. The walls of the church were decorated with stained glass in the shape of a spire. Attached to metal salts and oxides, gold produces acid fruit, cobalt produces blue, silver produces yellow ochre, gold and copper produce green and red, cut into a given shape and then inlaid with lead strips, when light passes through them At the time, people can only see black lines and colorful patches on the ground - they are said to be able to make souls closer to God; the end of the corridor is an oak cross with three adults, dark brown Before the cross is the old altar, and below is the right-handed spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John Carson has gone through cleaning and beauty, his head damage is too serious, makeup artist uses plaster, silicone, glue, oil paint, wig for him Doing repairs, the final result looks bad and not bad: he looks like a collection of wax museums, but it is much better than the original. His ex-wife put on a special black dress with a slit at his back. His hands were flat on both sides of his body, and his legs were straight – the legs that had returned home two days before the owner were treated and frozen. Stitched back to the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The invited people basically arrived on time, about three hundred people, twenty rows of dark wooden back benches were filled with them. John Carson’s younger brother sat in the front row with his wife, children, John Carson’s ex-wife and daughter, and other relatives and friends sat around them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest gave John Carson a short eulogy, then prayed for him, and finally he turned and said: "Let us be He prayed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone shook hands and lowered his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest noticed that at the end of the backrest bench was a man, in his thirties, with dark brown skin and a shirt that was exceptionally white. His black tie was meticulous, and the gold-rimmed glasses, the problem was on this pair of glasses. He was the first time to bring this thing, he had to touch it every three seconds, and he resisted when he prayed. He immediately took the glasses down after the prayer and wiped it with his sleeves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John Carson’s survivors took the lead. She hugged her daughter's shoulder and didn't relax for a moment, just like she was just a five- or six-year-old girl. It was necessary - the church seats, short walks of just seventy feet long, they slammed It took nearly ten minutes, and Chiz Carson closed his eyes from the beginning and the end. The head swayed, and the two feet were like the dolls that were wrongly jointed, not one to the left or one to the right. Either they are moving forward together. If the mother is not holding her daughter's waist and the other hand is holding her arm, Chiz Carson has long known that she has to fall many times. She is still doing withdrawal treatment, the most prominent of the withdrawal symptoms are lethargy, dullness and disorientation. Some people who know something about the situation began to whisper... Kaide Carson when he stepped off the steps outside the side door. That is, John Carson’s younger brother wanted to help, and she refused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spirit car that transported the spirits slowly moved forward, and the black cars that people took were followed, and the sky was raining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tomb is located on the east side of the cemetery. The people of the Carson family are basically buried here. The tomb has been dug. The black hole is surrounded by turf. They will have to be covered back later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Almighty God, since the compassionate, the soul of our loved one is attributed to God, we will bury his body in the ground," Father He said, he bent down and grabbed a handful of mud and cast it into the grave. "The soil is still in the soil, the gray is still in the dust, the dust is still in the dust. We do this because we really hope that the dead will rise to life by the Lord Jesus Christ." By then, Jesus will change our despicable body with the power of omnipresent to all things, as his own glorious body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More The soil was thrown into the grave by John Carson's relatives and friends. "Our father in heaven, may everyone respect your name." Until the last one, the long-awaited worker couldn't wait to wave the shovel and fill the grave. Use electricity to level the ground and cover the turf: "May your country come. May your will be done on the earth, as in the heavens... Our daily diet is given to us today. Free our debts, like us. Free of human debt. Don’t let us meet temptation, save We are free from evil."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because the kingdom, authority, and glory are all yours, forever, Amen."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QiZi Kaxun leans in the mother's arms with no expression, no matter what others say, how to do it, she will ignore it, it seems to be more breath than the dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Chis," said Cade Carson. "Let me send you home?" He looked at Chiz and her mother and shook his head: "Your current state is not suitable for driving," he said. His brother’s widow said: “You have to look curious, isn’t it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chiz’s waist was caught, she heard her mother’s breathing pause. Then she said, "Okay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"John Carson I only occupy a very small part of my life, and I am not as familiar as the school guards. So far, he only visited me twice, the first time far eight years ago, twelve Less than an hour, the second and a half weeks, the time he spent with him was far more than the time with me, and finally I was sent to death - he can never remember to buy me a birthday present, he I don't know if I hate yellow onions. He never yelled at the boy who harassed me. "He didn't even go to school to open a parent meeting, took me, called me, sent a letter, sent an email - the feelings between us are like chewing gum. I used to think that I have I fantasized that he stood on the side of the road, looked at me pitifully, called my name, and I raised my head proudly and walked away blindly. If he followed me and came home, I would ask him who he is. I will watch him cry... Mom, I always thought that I could despise and laugh at his death, because he is an irresponsible husband and father, he hurts you and my heart."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is really dead, I only know how much I am afraid to see this - fear makes me squint, listen to the surrounding voice, I close my eyes, hope this Everything is just a nightmare. I hope he is still alive. He spends Christmas in the Bering Sea with sea lions, walruses, polar bears, or sneak into the sea to study hairy worms. I think I can stand him absent from my wedding, the baptism of the children and Convinced, I will support him Career, I will send him a gift - birthday, Christmas, Easter, if he needs, I will give it to the Ascension Day and the Falling Day - as long as he is alive."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qizi’s mother whispered and she felt deeply regretful. No, not because she was divorced from John Carson, but she shouldn’t let Chiz know too much about her father... John Carson did not have a little bit of father’s responsibility, but she didn’t want to Let Chiz feel that she was abandoned - she subtly embellished John Carson, who described John Carson more than once, how handsome, tall, intelligent, and he achieved in schools and research institutes. Achievements and fruitful results, his courage, his perseverance, his yearning for good things... and how he expected the birth of Chiz - she just wanted to let Chiz feel that it might be nothing at all. Love. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She just wants to give her the best things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cad Carson originally wanted to go home, a phone call for him Changed my mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He drove directly to his company, it was time to get off work, the building was dark and quiet, the guards opened the door for him and turned on the lights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A Mr. Clos will come to see me, and you will bring him when you see him." He told him to walk into his office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A man sits quietly in his leather chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cade was so frightened that he almost cried out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's so amazing, Mr. Carson?" The man said, "You should have received my call before."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How did you get in?" Cade Carson whispered, and he always pays attention to the company's safety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are friends everywhere." The man stood up and sorted out his black tie and gold-rimmed glasses to make a move: "You are also our friend, aren't you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cad Carson has to take a deep breath to stabilize his emotions, he sits back to his position On the upper side, the leather chair wrapped him up immediately. He felt much safer: "Cecelle. Is it so uncomfortable than the sangdi?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Clos I didn't continue on this topic: "You will be very anxious - the news received three hours ago, the finance ministers have a meeting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cade. When he suddenly stood up, he snarled for a long time, "...about what?" His voice was shaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Only if it’s just money, it’s not enough to be included in the partnership’s scope by Chekale What really touched him was the other side of the other Sangdi family. They controlled the finance ministers of the region and controlled the source of the Fountain of Wealth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
