			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishb and his group were arranged in the best hotel in Orlosa, this hotel is the industry of the Cloven family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Correctly," Anthony Hopkins said: "The whole Orlosa is the Cloven family." He took it in his hand. With a fluffy, soft, large towel, it gently wipes the slender, wet, pale blond hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A city belongs to a certain family. It is not surprising that Sasha is a stranger. Poseidon Island belongs to the Sangdi family, while other families divide the surrounding area of ​​Poseidon. Dozens of small islands. At the time when Masaoye was most prosperous, nearly a quarter of the land on the Western continent was regarded as the "sage" in the dark than the old man of the Sangdi family and affiliated families, who controlled the economy of the entire city. Lifeline, arbitrarily slamming officials, mastering the lives and deaths of countless people, their rights are bigger than the mayor, minister, and even the president - then there are people who dare to laugh at and smear the president in newspapers and television, but Even today, no one dares to openly blame and ridicule an "old man". Even if he is guilty of crimes, he will be arbitrarily, because the efficiency of gangs is always higher than any institution, and their punishment will directly jeopardize your relatives and friends. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The golden age of "Masoy" has lasted for 20 years. Once there was such a period of time, it became the "king" of this country. But in the end they still failed. When the entire state machine was rumbling under the command of a savvy, hard-core ruler, nothing and the organization could resist its crushing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several large regions in the northern part of the Western Confederation that were originally a huge country. They failed to withstand the test of war and famine, and persisted in pain. After a century, it finally fell unwillingly and unwillingly fell, split into areas controlled by several forces. Most of these forces are from the military and special departments. No one can be more familiar with the country than they are. After the country is torn apart, they can be said to have turned into family-style gangs at night and took over at a very fast pace. Economic, political and human resources in the region. And with these precious resources, we are developing wildly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not that their entanglement, struggle, and stifling have never stopped, the young federation may not be able to ask for anything cheap from them, let alone They become the little stars on their flags. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, I must have been staring at them all the time," Sasha said. Big Hopkins listened, reaching out and touching his son's hair, his hair still a little wet, and it felt like a little lamb drenched in the rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who is letting Chegaler than Sangdi should have this sale?" Sasha sat on the bed and lapped his knees: "Transporting so much The color of the pen is really a dangerous thing, and there is no shortage of money than the Sangdi. Although I don’t know how much he can get this time, this money will definitely not make him ruin the relationship between 'Masoye’ and Zhengfu. The degree of the 'peace' state."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But he still did." Dr. Hopkins said that he lowered his head and smelled Sasha. the taste of. The shower gel is provided with amber oil. The boy smelled like a broken tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because that is the deal that Zheng Fu gave him." Sasha calmly concluded: "The little tricks commonly used by politicians, they look at it and look at that comparison." Strong, that weaker, weaker side can get their help - so the Cloven family will be so weird. I can see that Constantine also can see - but they have to No, they can't, they can't get such goods from other people or organizations, but don't expect them to change their views and hold goodwill on this issue. There is a saying in the East that it is called drinking and quenching thirst, but it is thirsty. The dead person will not thank a person who handed him poisonous wine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The person who came up with this method is very bold," Hopkins The doctor said: "The Cloven family will be a double-edged sword - but the government is not doing charity, the Cloven family needs to bleed for this gift - what is the most of Orlosa? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Diamonds, they pay with diamonds ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, lovable, bright and transparent little stones. Very valuable, small in size, the part they have to pay Still not satisfied with a suitcase, even the payment of the Besib family is paid in this form." Anthony Hopkins said: "Maybe you still don't know. Father Peter is a person who has considerable research on diamonds." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father after getting rid of the catastrophe, Father Peter slept beautifully One night, the next day's breakfast, he asked for two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His friend personally came to pick him up. Under the will of God, they did not go to church. Instead, it went to another place where people could understand the pride, vanity and greed of mankind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diamond processing line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only a few, sellers believe that trusted and purchasing customers can join the ranks of the tour, no more than 20 people each time, on the way Keep quiet, follow the order, and follow the manager's arrangements - Father Peter is not here for the first time, but every time he is so excited and full of spirit, he loves these little stones, but the monk's simple thoughts are Constantly condemning his heart, so he never wears a diamond on his body, can touch it in the transaction, and it is enough for him to appreciate it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before him, is a mother and daughter, although they look more like a pair of older sisters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl used to take poison, Father Peter can see it at a glance, maybe she is still taking treatment now - she is scary, her mother When I look at her, it is like carrying a medical skeleton model. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But her spirit is not bad, she can cheer herself up and be interested in things other than drugs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rough diamond adheres to the gray-green rough stone and looks like a small piece of rock sugar slag. The person responsible for the cutting takes it down and cuts the rough diamond. A 2 micron laser was used. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some diamond roughs may have laps or cracks due to internal pressure. At this time, the use of laser cutting is risky, and the cutters will use the bronze wheel that people used to cut diamonds hundreds of years ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What shape, round, pear-shaped, heart-shaped diamonds are cut into the hands of the cutting staff and subsequent grinding personnel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The initial shape of the diamond is fixed on a special instrument, the grinding wheel is coated with diamond powder, and the grinding person polishes the diamond while listening to The sound of diamonds rubbing against the grinding wheel, because the diamonds that are used by ordinary workers are often very small, as long as the sound of the friction between the diamond and the grinding wheel is not heard, it is basically determined that the original stone has fallen off the holder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So are they still likely to be found back?" The girl asked, her voice weak and weak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course," the guide replied kindly: "We have a dedicated 'capture', and there are strict rules - if the diamond falls off, then All people must stop working and sit in their original position. There are special people to look for. Orlosa has been established for 60 years. In these six decades, only one rough stone was not found. - No, can't say that, because we found it on the wall a few years later, it flew out and got into the wall."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guiding The man pointed at an invisible place on the wall, indicating that it was the place where the original stone was drilled. Father Peter noticed that the girl did not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After cutting and rinsing, the diamond has revealed true brilliance and intrinsic, and then it needs an accurate assessment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This work is also carried out by experienced and professional staff who, after the inspection, put the diamonds in plastic bags, which are simple Indicate the diamond's information, weight, quality, etc. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some diamonds will be sent to the national treasury, and now the country will replace some gold reserves with diamonds, and the other part will be sent to inlaid jewelry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orlosa also produces gold. The gold nuggets for making gold and diamond jewelry are one kilogram and platinum, but only much less than gold. Workers use machines and tools to create rough diamond-studded blanks that need to be inspected and qualified to receive diamonds. The gold chips generated during the blank casting and grinding process are collected separately according to the color and placed in a glass vial indicating the purity and type of gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The diamond-studded gold is the same as the diamond, and it will be loaded into the plastic bag after inspection by the x-met 7500 handheld x-ray fluorescence spectrometer. However, the small sticker above is written about this diamond-studded gold ornament. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The end of the room, the fine finished products were sold out, the diamonds here are the best, even if you just stay in the same place, as long as there is A ray of light, it can also emit a fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father Peter holds a golden cross, the center of the cross is inlaid with a diamond of about 1.5 carats, very pure, with a light blue color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
