			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two are more one, a little less, and it’s better to continue tomorrow...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** *<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day is dark and sudden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thick clouds are being swayed by the winds of the sky, moving forward at a speed visible to the naked eye, and the winds on the ground are rolling up tiny stones and dust. Buildings and humans squirmed on the face and body; the vehicles around them speeded up, and the girls riding bicycles pulled up their hoods, lowered their heads, squinted, closed their mouths, and sucked in a small amount. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dolores," a girl called. "Go to my house for a while."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;She parked her own white bicycle in front of the gray porch, lit up the orange-yellow light in the window of the street, which was surely clean, warm, and a hot cup of chocolate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you," the wind whizzing through them and making a huge noise, the brunette girl raised her volume, "but I still want to Going home - it should be okay to catch up!" She waved to her friend and jumped into her short stroller with a kind of sorrow we often see in the boy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her friend stood under the porch and waved her hand at her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You should let Dolores come in for a while," her friend's brother poked his head out of the open door. "It's going to rain soon." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She must be eager to go back to look after her mother," the girl said: "Her mother has been pregnant for forty-two weeks, and her father is on a business trip. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her brother’s face showed a skeptical look, and he felt that his sister was perfunctory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because Dolores has been licking this thing," the girl pushed her brother: "The baby is like a squat." In her belly, so say.........these three months...no, in the first half of the year..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her brother raised his arm. "How?" He was a little nervous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the past six months, you don't want to ask her to go out again." The girl gloated and said: "Her heart has been her unborn brother or sister. When you are full, you can't put up a nervous male idiot."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brother raised his fist threateningly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Give me a bicycle," said the sister. "I will tell you, the Valentine's Day gift she wants is a perfume or a lipstick."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Complete."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dolores turned a corner. The wind is bigger, and the next road is almost full of wind, the wind is pressing her nose, she feels that breathing is difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In her car pocket. In addition to the school bag, there is also a handmade dessert. The fluffy and golden sponge cake is sandwiched between blueberries and sour cream. Dolores does not use any extra materials, especially spices, even if it is not mentioned in the cookbook. Spices can cause discomfort to pregnant women and the fetus - since the mother’s second pregnancy, the girl has searched all the books and materials that can be found, from the library, the Internet, and the school health doctor – she took it for the first time. When this problem is to disturb the health care doctor. The worried and cautious temperament made the old-fashioned middle-aged man mistakenly think that he had run into an unintended pregnant girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has already received too many such girls. In the high school where Dolores is currently enrolled, teachers began to popularize contraception in the ninth grade, but Some girls will encounter a rude, selfish boyfriend, a broken sleeve or a failed contraceptive. When they first encountered such a thing, they often turned to their parents or other elders, but the school’s health care doctors – they wanted to get medicine from him, so that the whole thing could be silently pressed. Going on, it didn't happen at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not expect that Dolores would be one of them, Dolores is a good girl, she has a boyfriend. But wearing a "shoulder ring" on her finger means she won't throw her own first time before getting married. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately this is just a minor misunderstanding. The health doctor gave Dolores some very good advice. He has five children and is a responsible husband. And good daddy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today's sour cream cake is one of his recommendations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bright light passed from the corner of the brunette girl, she was shocked. The brakes were pinched, but no vehicle she thought was passing by. A drop of cold rain hit her face. She looked up at the sky, and the gray-black clouds seemed to be within reach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thunder of rumble came from afar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to say something here, Dolores is not satisfied. Probably the weather. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kent family has been here for more than seven years, that... After the incident, Mr. Kent sold the house and quit his job. I went to Dolores for the process of dropping out of school - in a few months, they had a very difficult time. Dolores often had a fever and was in a weak state. Mary Kent had been bleeding. They had no fixed place and no stability. The income, Mr. Kent, who is busy taking care of two patients, can’t afford the spirit and strength to find a job again – until a person buys their farm, they make a small fortune, and the room for choosing a new home is big. A lot, Mr. Kent, Mrs. Kent, Dolores unanimously chose the farthest distance from their former home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warm, moist, tranquil, fresh air, rich in fresh fruits and vegetables, or, as long as you can stay away from that nightmare - Mary Kent’s body gradually improves and Strong, she can yell at the picky and mischievous Dolores, and Mr. Kent found a rewarding new job, Dolores has a gentle teacher, kindly classmates, pro Such as sisters' close friends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything is moving in the right direction, Dolores has made a face to the sky - except June, July, August, September, In October, it will take a half-month of thunderstorms in a month! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is something that bursts in the dry, humid air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The odor was quickly taken away by the wind, a small pit appeared on the flat ground, the bicycle violently turned around, and the paper bag with the cake jumped out of the net pocket. It fell to the ground, the mouth of the bag cracked, and the mushroom-shaped cake rolled everywhere on the black road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dolores hurriedly stopped the car, but there was already a small cake under her wheel, and fortunately, the teachers of the community today asked them Wrap every little cake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, damn it," she muttered. The raindrops had begun to become dense. She jumped out of the car, picked up the paper bag, and threw the rolled cakes into the paper bags one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third glowing ball drifted away from her only four or five steps away. The first thing it encountered - a vibrant wild sunflower blasted into the ground, the disk ignited, and Dolores smelled the scorching smell of the nuts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More small balls of light have appeared, each of them is only as big as a fist. Floating in the air and raindrops. Red and gold, bright glare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl stood up and lost the cake in her hand. She wants to escape, but those little balls of light are like a master's puppy that flutters to her cheerfully. It's weird, it's actually cool - Dolores thought, then she was burned The light is engulfed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Martin walked slowly out of the wild grass that covered him, his thumb in his trouser pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He bowed his head and looked at his prey, the job was boring. Simply like breaking a daisy, the girl lies on a black road, the ball-type lightning burns out her clothes, and her chest is not well developed, for Martin. Flat is like a man, the skin is not white enough, lightning has left a red scar on it, her shoes are still there, the soles are pierced through a few holes, eyes are open, black eyes. lifeless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the murderer was about to walk away, he saw something shining on the girl’s finger, and he picked it up and looked at it, it was a The ring, the front is engraved with "to leave the most precious gift to your favorite person", the opposite is engraved with Dolores Kent. He saw on the shopping site that someone was selling this thing, "keeping the ring," he said to himself, revealing a smile that would almost make the deceased tremble. "Or I can check it. I hope you There is no lying, girl."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The small cake that fell on the road was quickly dumped and the heavy rain broke the package, and the rain hit the soft eggs. Flour and cream, they spread out, together with the cold water, rushed into the dark drains of sludge and scum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dolores Kent’s funeral only saw Mr. Kent . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher, classmate, and friend of the dark-haired girl dropped the white rose, and the coffin sank into the soil, and the crowd gradually dispersed. Only Mr. Kent stood still. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood in the dark, the cemetery had to close, and went out, his legs almost no feeling, he wondered why he would not fall Down, just like he wonders why he didn’t cry so that the vocal cords broke, his eyes fell... He fluttered, squatting forward, going forward... This road is too long, looks like it’s forever Can't go to an end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A black Maybach car parked on the side of the road he must pass, while Mr. Kent passed, the window with the black film quietly Falling down, alone, or according to Mr. Kent's first impression, a stiff puppet looked at him from behind his hat, mask and three-piece suit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Show your grief to you." The puppet said that its voice was very light and vague, as the person who carved him forgot to open him. Point the mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Thank you." Mr. Kent’s consciousness was a bit confusing, and he nodded subconsciously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dolores is a good boy," said the man. "She shouldn't have encountered this kind of thing."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tears flowed from Mr. Kent’s eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think you must be very painful," the man said. "I understand this feeling because I also lost my little daughter, only. Although she is not a good boy in many people's eyes, she is really smart and cute... She has done a lot of wrong things, but it is because she is too young, she is not sensible, she needs education. And I am also wrong - I am a useless father, I am poor, very poor, I shouted at her because she did not want to eat canned corned beef, but also threw them on the ground; her wardrobe always It’s empty, there are only a few pieces of clothes, and it’s all chemical. I can’t even afford the double-skin ballet shoes – I never even took her to Disneyland, nor took her out to spend the holiday. Before she left me, she had never seen the sea and the beach. She had to help her mother with housework. Although she was still so small, she was really good. She also had good grades at school. The teacher told me that she might be the only one in our district to apply for ranking. University students before ten, she would be a lawyer, a doctor, a politician, in short, a great man "<br <br /> & nbsp />;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;He noticed that Mr. Kent was looking at his car in confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am rich now," the man explained. "But that was after she left me."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, no, no," the man continued. He shook his head slightly, almost invisible: "At that time, she didn't really... leave me," he said. Sobbing, no matter who you are, you can clearly hear the deep pain contained in it: "She ran out, but still alive, I want to find her back, I thought about how to punish her, really - A little punishment, playing ass or something..." He said in a bit incoherently: "I thought that she might suffer, and even suffer some damage - I will severely reprimand her and let her remember this. Lessons - then we can, can live the kind of life she wants, she can buy clothes, bags, shoes, study at the best private girls' school, go on a holiday on the Caribbean island... I couldn't give it to her before, but now I can give it - but someone told me that she is dead, dead, you Dao... How desperate I am, I really want the whole world to die with me... Sorry, I probably shouldn’t say that, but...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I understand." Mr. Kent said that when he saw his cold daughter, he also wanted to tear anyone who could stand in front of him and still be alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right," said the man: "We are all fathers who have lost their daughters."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;He slowly raised one hand, the hand was wearing gloves, and in this still sultry weather, his dress was eccentric, but Mr. Kent did not notice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hand holds a white rose, and the white petals are tightly wrapped in the emerald-colored sepals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin got his reward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his bag, there is also a silver ring, a guard ring, the girl did not lie, he was satisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the corridor of the "Babel Tower", he almost hit Catherine, and Catherine was also a bit wrong. She was obviously mentally awkward and unsettled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
