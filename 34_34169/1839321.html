The leader said that he leaned over and allowed the dean to see the situation in the barn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dean has not yet seen the smell of sweet and bloody before, the monks, and the instructors and heads, all Adults, they are gathered in a corner with a first-aid bandage for the Boy Scouts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dean looked at the leader angrily, they just left for half an hour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For adults, this is a routine procedure, as long as they don't tremble or deliberately miss when they are facing each other." The leader said: "We also You can kill them directly, if you think that's better." He went to the group to check their wounds, everyone was injured in the same place, the blood was extravasated slowly, did not touch the bones, nor I came across the artery: "This is done by one person," he said with appreciation. "It's very beautiful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you tell me who the person is? "He said to the injured people: "I can give him a small reward."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is me." The head said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are a professional."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I talked and said that when we finished our work," the leader said, "You can get your reward."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked toward the children. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the group wanted to stand up and be dragged by the monks and instructors around him. The murder of the leader’s words was as long as it was personally audible. Perhaps the best result of rashly acting is that he was killed himself, and the worst is that the children will also be included in the ranks of anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I like beautiful children." The leader said to the dean, and then began to carefully look at each child, but his decision was very quick, as if it had been picked very early. "You, black hair," he pointed to Besib, "And you," Sasha. "You," Boa. Douglas, "You," Charlie. "You," another Grande student, the last one he paused for a few seconds: "You." Lila. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is a girl." Charlie said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It takes a lot of effort to push that roulette," the dean said. "Girls can't."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The leader’s sight fell on Lila’s body, and she clung to Sasha’s arm: “He is your little boyfriend,” he said. “Then you stay here, or follow your little boyfriend. Go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I followed him." Lila said without hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good girl." The leader said, "Do you have strength?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Great "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Great." The leader said: "I hope you are telling the truth, otherwise I can only kill your boyfriend first, then Killed you." He glanced at the Dean: "Because someone has delayed me a lot of time, it is difficult for me to tolerate who will play me again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;When the child selected by the leader was taken out by the soldiers. The head looked at them, his eyes filled with anxiety and panic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a minute."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader turned around: "Yes, oh, you want What did you say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the team glanced at the door, "Let the child come back - whatever you want to do. Let him come back, I will go." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The child with yellow curly hair." The head said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cause?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is my son."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader stood in the same place, the lamp at the top of the barn cast a shadow on his face, he was actually a beautiful man The body is long, even wearing a camouflage jacket and high boots, thick boots, the color of the "dirty" field work boots did not affect his style. He did not speak and waved to the head of the team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the group stood up, no one came to stop him this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He relied on the uninjured leg to get to the leader, and the smell of blood became rich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have your own leg on your leg?" asked the leader. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader looked at the soldiers in the barn, the soldiers patted Glock17 on the right leg made a shot gesture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader smiled. He dropped his left hand and pulled out his knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His knives are more gorgeous than the soldiers, with straight-edged spring knives with double-edge teeth, the blade length is four and a half inches, and the handle is black. Aviation aluminum alloy. Inlaid with a blue-green abalone shell floating like a water surface covered with oil, when it is attached to the head of the head, the slippery feeling makes him want to vomit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A professional," the leader said: "It is completely different from a child."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp He opened the knife and the blade slammed out, and the tip pierced the lower eyelid of the leader. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you think so too, nod."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lila grabbed her face as she walked back to the baptismal hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky above the Grand River has turned into an egg white, and it will soon be dawning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She holds the arm of Sasha. The boy’s room had no doors, they didn’t have time to wear clothes, so Sasha Hopkins, who had always been neatly dressed, wore only one pair of trousers and upper body – he thought that Lila’s gradual rise in body temperature was forced to move forward. The relationship, but he immediately thought that the girl around him was also a versatile person. He looked at him sideways - Lila’s face was very red, not the healthy red color caused by the bloody movement after exercise, but the kind of omen The abnormal flush of the disease has already arrived - and her face has a very serious red rash, and the bulge is obvious. She keeps catching and keeps the blood marks of the next strip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you think?" Sasha whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Itchy." Lila gasped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib is behind them, he is Charlie next to them, they are just big kids, but they are not underestimated and relaxed, they are in parallel, Arms with each other, half a dozen soldiers closely monitor them - the famas f1 rifle has four indicator holes on the side wall of the magazine, from which you can see the amount of bombs, they are full, twenty-five The bullet k17 is a kind of pistol and a pistol that is loved by all. Because its safety device refers to a double-barreled shotgun, the small trigger on the front is a bumper. As long as the finger pulls the trigger, the insurance is also opened, which ensures safety. Avoid fools who forget to turn off insurance. It can also increase the speed of shooting. Just pull it out and shoot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Chekal Bissance is here, these soldiers can only say that it is a breakfast, but only his son is here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in Baiyancheng. When Besib fell into a state of collapse due to the rose of John Elder, he swallowed bronze sculptures, lampposts and dustbins, fire hydrants and bullets that hit him – and ordinary people in a critical moment due to the emergency of adrenaline. It’s as if the mobilization can do things that you can’t do at all, and the abilities will increase their abilities to a point that they can’t imagine in an instant for a variety of reasons—but these two The situation is equally dangerous for the parties: the enormous power that ordinary people produce when the adrenaline is high. At the cost of interrupting other normal physiological functions, muscle fiber tears, joint dislocation, loss of pain, decreased stress, and possibly death; and the abilities of the abilities, in addition to the above, become worse, such as Besib, if it was not the power of Sasha, it also lost control, and the power in the door escaped. He may be madly splitting into countless small mouths on that rainy night, and the insatiable slime sneaked into the sewers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He reluctantly restored his human form. After returning to Grande, Dr. Hopkins gave him a check and he was told recently. At least for a year, you can't use your abilities when you are less than your life. Can Sasha Hopkins once again stick him up and stick it into a normal Besib. Land? No one is sure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it now a life-threatening time? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bessib couldn’t help but sigh in his heart, which should have been a relaxed, pleasant, simple. A rare trip! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The biggest difference between the baptistery of this monastery and the baptistery in other places is that it is not, but is connected by a long ramp to the main body of the monastery, like a cross on the cross. The fruits, the boots of the children and the soldiers caused a huge echo in this closed ramp, and rumbling. Rumbled, they were taken into the baptistery, and the soldiers let them stand beside the dripper in the baptistery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baoer. Douglas nervously rubbed the marble floor with his toes and tried to look around unobtrusively. The baptismal hall was covered with marble. In the tradition of Romanesque architecture, the windows are in very high places, small and narrow. Besib guessed that he must have regretted not using the power of plants to escape when he passed through the olive groves. He did not dare. Just when the soldiers ordered the adults to squash each other, the head of the army made a noise, and the soldiers said nothing. , shot a shot on his leg, the bullet penetrated his leg, and when others were busy messing with him to stop bleeding, Boa glanced at it, and the hole almost made him put his fist in! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Real, terrible, everted skin, yellowish fat, and nothing similar to what he saw on television and in newspapers, those The hero character smashes the gun at most and only leaves a big red flower on the shirt or trousers, which is no different from the weight of his mother staying on the sanitary napkin! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was scared. When passing through the olive groves, tens of thousands of branches trembled in the cool wind. Come, they said, spur us, Let us grow long, thick, and then hide behind us. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then? Boa can imagine that his body was smashed together with the olive trees, and the white inner core of the tree was sprayed with his own red skin. It was remembered how the gardeners at home used it. Is the mower flattening the grass, and how does the grass sprinkle from the back side of the mower? That's it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after entering the baptismal hall, remorse floated up like a venomous snake, biting his heart, he called plants, plants responded It was very weak and the soil was too far away from him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader walked into the baptismal hall, and the dean followed behind the guards of the two soldiers. The back of the dean was tall with the same two soldiers. the man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dad!" Charlie shouted in horror as he saw his father's face faint, with only one eye open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
