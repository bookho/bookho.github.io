The voice ordered: "Throw it into the reeds," he said: "Pedestrian The guards are likely to pass through here at any time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avery threw the dead cat out, and at that moment he felt his arm sting, and that After the cat was soaked in water, it was as heavy as lead. It fell on the border with the grass and the reeds. After a few tumblings, it did not move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black cat’s jaw and trachea are pinched by two thick fingers, its shiny claws screaming in the air and violently screaming, the one who captured it Holding his head, holding the spine in one hand, the thumb is forced, the cat's cervical spine is suddenly detached, and its head hangs down at once - the person holding it goes forward and wipes the AI Free's arm, he crouched down the water, pushing the black cat into the water with a soothing soothing movement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is all right." The man said, "Follow me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Fry saw his face. He blinked his eyes in disbelief. The man snorted when he wanted to talk. "Don't be here," he said. "We want to find a better, safer one." Place."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He strode forward, Avery hesitated and followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person is very familiar with Grande, he has been hiding here for many years, he makes good use of every abandoned classroom, empty warehouse, lonely Corner - He walked into a black huts with Avery, and Avery had been in Grande for several years, but he didn't have any impression of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person opened a yellow-yellow emergency light, and the small room was filled with dust and cobwebs, the smell of rats, and the suffocation of river fish. At the corner of the room, there are nets, fishing rods and other fishing-related things. The lights are dangling with shadows. The "master" of the hut drags a wooden box behind the fragile mark from the side. Folding stool, "Do you want to take a stool or a wooden box?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avery looked at him. Avery is a big man, and there is no doubt that the person standing in front of him is short of him, but from the horizontal size. He is no more than Avery, and the small stool made up of thin canvas and a few thin aluminum alloy strips may be changed from three to three when one of them dares to give the weight of the whole body to it. In two dimensions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am sitting on the ground." Avery said that he put down his huge body with agility that was hard to find in his physique. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master" nodded, put the folding stools up and sat on the wooden box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avery thought he would say something, but he stretched his arm and found a thin part from the side of the wooden box that was blocked by the net. Long glass bottle. He didn't use the opening tool and screwed the cap directly with his finger - he took a sip and handed it to Avery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avery hasn't picked it up yet. He smelled a sweet scent, and he took a sip of it, it was wine, but it was very sweet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Drink two more," the man said. The wording is still imperative, but Avery can feel a little goodwill from it: "Sweet wine with a sweetness of 5 or more is good for preventing colds and bronchitis."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to kill the beige-colored curling fat cat, the cold river water soaked his two arms from the cuffs, and some of the water poured into the open neckline of the jacket while it was dying. Wet his t-shirt, the wind blows past. The volatilized water vapor took a lot of calories, Avery didn't know the wine, there was no wine in the school, and his father sometimes allowed him to drink some beer, but that was just a civilian beer, like Budweiser. He didn't know that sweet wine was one of the noble wines. The raw material for brewing it was also the most expensive of all the wines. A small bottle in his hand could be exchanged for a box of Budweiser beer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this does not affect the role of sweet wine in his body, its alcohol content is higher than the average honey. Almost flush with brandy. Less than an ounce of wine can set a small flame in the boy's stomach, and he quickly feels warm. Avery holds the thin neck of the bottle, drinks two, two big mouths, and the flame becomes Unprecedented as ever, it flows along the blood vessels and delivers vigorous heat to the tiniest positions, including the cold toes and fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man noticed Avery, he took the bottle back when he was about to drink a third, and he needed to paralyze the boy and let him put it down. I am slow, but I don't want him to get drunk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can guess why you are doing this..." The man said, "But this is so stupid, it’s ridiculous. Poor little fool, You almost sent yourself to the court - there is a prison, yes, Avery, I think you can think of it, you are an adult, the judge will not treat you as a child when you are sentenced, although you do It’s a child. Only children can do things that make people who care about you sad and disappointed. If you are discovered, do you know how many years will you be sentenced? Experts and psychologists who don’t want to prove each year want to prove People who abuse cats or dogs will become a serial murderer when the time is right. They will send you to a mental hospital or prison. No matter what, Avery, you are finished, after your sister, your parents. Lost the last hope."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;& Nbsp;; & nbsp; & nbsp; <br /> <br /> & nbsp ". Just cats only," "a man after a fight with his girlfriend, his dog to vent anger, he hit it with a golf club, North Korea It shoots and puts it behind the car, because he knows that if he is beaten and judged by his girlfriend, he will, like you, think that killing a beast is no big deal, someone alarms, he Was arrested, the judge sentenced him to fifteen years in prison, dear, fifteen years, at least five years, he can get parole - this is an ordinary person, let me say, the hound team's quarterback Wei Peis, his poster on the wall of the team's locker room, this poster will soon be taken down, he was suspended for the life of the association, the hound team had to sweep him out, at his golden age Why? He hanged his dog because it did not perform well in the dog's fight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you think about their stress? Are you big?" The man continued: "When you stand in the dock, you can speak out loud for yourself. Can you solve it? Grande’s school board will laugh and send all the evidence they can search for – the small stream that was rushed out by the school football team because of illegal drug sales.) The school is generous and allows you to Grande continues to attend school, but you have transferred your defeat and anger to the innocent little creatures, killing them with cruel means, and abandoning their bodies on the wooden path that people come and go - you think there will be How many people will think that you are justifiable? How many people think that it is best to nail your butt on the ground for 30 years, so that human society has a dangerous scum?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't sell - I just..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You just gave him a box of medicine, take It was money. It was photographed by the monitoring probe. This is enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is what he asked for, this is not fair!" Avery yelled Road: "I know that more people are doing business!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Evidence?" The man is strict Say: "Grand is not a charity - the things your parents are holding have already made the members angry. You are so embarrassed, they will prove that you cheated on the last exam - you think they really took you No way? You have to stay here for a year and a half. And this little scandal will sink into the bottom of Grande before Christmas."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't waste our expectations," he said. "Your parents, your sister, and... my."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he saw Avery's confused eyes, he smiled broadly: "What do you think? Those photos and videos are God's sending angels to your parents' hands?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avery opened his mouth, alcohol made his eyes straight, his face blush: "...but...I mean..." He stuttered: "...thank you... But why are you doing this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are one of my favorite students," said the man. "Maybe you don't notice it because I have never been swearing at any student. But this is true. I like your kind, honest and open-minded children, especially you - so I will be here, I can’t bear to see you, so I ruin myself. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avery faintly moved his body. The tidal and cold new "seat" made him wake up: "I have been ruined," he said with frustration and sadness: "I am finished, I was driven out by the football team, I can't Apply to Manchester."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Manchester is a university that every student will yearn for," the man said. "But your efforts are too late, if you If you want to apply for Manchester, at the latest, you should start to pay attention to your achievements in the fourth grade - and your grades have been maintained at around 3 to 3.5. You have to admit that you prefer to run on the court compared to reading. Also, I clearly remember that in the second semester of the eighth grade, you submitted an intentional assignment. You said that you will apply to Tufts University, which is known for its biology and agricultural research, ranking one hundred and two. Thirteen, very good. You discussed with me, you like the field. Like crops, like to see the lush harvest scene, you will inherit your father's farm -"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I changed my mind," Ai Frye was rudely interrupted by his words: "I want to apply for Manchester. Of course," he added with anger. "With my grades, my application will only be rejected mercilessly... So I will..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Use illegal drugs." The man gently blamed: "You want the quarterback, and the captain's position." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The only way to get into Manchester is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have no choice but to be scrupulous Just to enter Manchester, Avery, this is not the big deal. You have never been an ambitious child. Can you tell me why?" The man said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Why do you have to get to the bottom of this?” Avery responded sultryly: “Now I don’t even have the ability to apply for a university with a ranking of 321, given that the Grand School Board will leave That one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because I can let you apply to Manchester." The man said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avery looked at him like he was looking at a madman who was more crazy than himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You want to apply for Manchester," the man said: "Because the murderer has said that he will receive a secret society in Manchester next year." The 'Lion Club' invitation is one of them; Manchester's 'Lion Club' only absorbs fifteen second-year students, which means that he is a 1,500 first-year student at Manchester University this year. One - this range will be greatly reduced next year, becoming one-fifth; this recruitment ceremony is open, so you want to apply for Manchester, if possible, you want to be a member of the 'Lion Club' So that you can see the list of the participants in the previous year without much effort. If not, you can also try to find their names from other students. Next, you can check them step by step until - - Until he dug out the mixed ball, he made a hole in your sister's chest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avery's eyes are full of horror and fear, he doesn't understand . The biggest and deepest secret of myself is how to be known by this person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look, even ordinary people like me," said the man: "As long as I want to know, I can know - you think this secret is really still Is it a secret? They even killed one, and the Jessie policewoman who told you about this on the public phone has disappeared. The reason why those people ignore you is because you can easily use your little finger. The dead bugs, you have been destroyed, and your parents may go bankrupt in the near future - the embarrassing life will replace them to oppress you to what you can't do, can't think of. Ah. Or you will Say, you will hold a press conference and tell everyone that your sister was shot dead by a scheduled member of the 'Lion Club', but you have no evidence. There is no witness, your sister is a gun robber. Killed, your sister’s fiancé was dereliction of duty, the murderer caught it, and the case has already been settled. Do you think someone will be willing to listen to your nonsense?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man looked outside the house: "He I must be very happy to see that you are working hard with a few cats and a dog. Their people may be outside the door. They will rush in and grab you at any time. If you can prove that you are a madman, then every word you say is not Someone will believe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was pleased to see that the boy’s face had faded from the last trace of blood – the little guy was terrified, but he stabilized himself in a short time, he thought, and observed the expression of the senior . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you said..." The boy said, "You said that I can apply to Manchester."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes. I can." The man admitted: "But you have to understand that it is very difficult, and I don't want to spend so much time, connections and money, only to get a mess everywhere. Biting a mad dog. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As you said, my parents will soon go bankrupt." Avery said with a gloomy and full of doubts: "You Is it money now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't want money." The man said: "First, I still like you very much. Second, I need people. I am looking at you, lucky little idiot."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want me to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "I can't say it now." The man said: "Do not worry, I am not interested in those small packaged powders, do not like to buy and sell bumpy things, but also lack of interest in politics - what I need is not to Something - 譬Says, Hopkins." He said kindly: "Another child I like, I like it more than you - but don't be embarrassed, he is special."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey?" Avery said: "I won't, I gave up very early, this guy is a comet (referring to Superman)."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man was teased by his words: "Isn't it? It's smart, strong, and beautiful, and God must have used up his mind when he made him--and Besib. Have you envied him? If you can have half of his skills - you will not come up with stupid things about using illegal drugs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ball Everyone on the team, half of the students who took Grande, are envious of him." Avery said: "I am no exception."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" In fact, "that person said: "This is also very unfair."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They cheated?" Avery said: "Besib's muscles Can't rely on cheating - I haven't seen him use the medicine." He curled his lips: "Don't he take medicine where we can't see it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
