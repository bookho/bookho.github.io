			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the imagination of most people, people who are called "Tang" always live in a huge manor that is far away from the crowd and guarded heavily - black The cast iron gates open silently, the gray concrete road leads straight to the big house with forty rooms, the face is serious, the ruthless guards are lurking in the shadows like black flowers, and the monitoring probes are numerous and dense. Stop at any place you want or can't think of, towering foyer, polished marble mosaic floor, clear crystal chandelier, deep red wool rug, carved hardwood wooden door, sheet metal door handle, The well-trained servant walked between the thresholds with his toes on his toes. A beautiful man walked down the winding stairs, his white shoulders and neck were bare, and the black tulle unfortunately covered the other parts, the diamond suspension Above the heart, she smiles and walks towards her master, a well-dressed beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, no, not at all, at least Don. Chegal. Bisangdi does not like it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lives with his family in the mountain town of Poseidon Island, surrounded by layers of local residents' houses - old-fashioned, probably only one person The high wall is mottled and old. Like the walls of other houses, it has a history of more than one hundred years. It is made of auburn and beige ochre, and the stone walls of different sizes have been peeled off. There is no power grid or wire or broken glass at the top. Only the accumulated years of rain, the traces of rain washed down, they occupy almost three quarters of the wall, and they look like they are close to the wall. The black vines of the soil; the fruitful olive trees poke out the body from the wall, cast a heavy shadow on the stone road outside the wall, the houses of the sea sand color are tightly wrapped in them, if you want, stand taller On the steps, you can see the black-framed windows on the second floor, the rain bucket and downpipe with the former, and the roof tiles of the vines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The car can only reach the middle of the mountain town, there is still a distance from the residence of Tang, you must walk over, Big Hopkins and him at the invitation of Meyare Walking side by side, Little Hopkins sat on the shoulders of a guard. They climbed the bready hills along the wide stone steps and turned into a narrow alley at the top of the road, along the alley. Next, it is a circular patio-shaped small square. On one side of the square is a miniature chapel. "There is a graveyard behind," Meyare said. "The people of the Sangdi family will be buried there, our women. Pray there," he stared at the church, took off his hat, crossed a cross on his chest, but kept his feet - facing the church was another, more spacious road, the sun inlaid with gold rims always left Shot in the thin sky, the iron frame on the yellow goose walls on both sides, the brick red pots in the frame, the star-like flowers and the lush leaves rushing out from the inside. The air has a vague smell of sulphur. There salty sea breeze, surrounded by quiet unusual, people only hear the footsteps of their own chatter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The houses on both sides of the road belong to Bisang, and Tang Chegaler Bisangdi is in the deepest place. He is surrounded and protected by his own people and is very safe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meyal took a sniff and rang the doorbell. Sasha slipped from the guard’s shoulder and handed it to his father, who had not opened the door. Before, he had plenty of time to look around - a few black, holes full of holes were placed next to the entry steps, a wheel with his height leaning against them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Etna volcano is above us, and Poseidon Island has been buried seven times," Meyare said. "It is a generous and stern Father, brought us fertile volcanic ash, but also brought death, but we are not willing to leave here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The size of Hopkins came together Eyes - not so much courage, it is better to say that the residents of Poseidon Island seem to be more willing to enjoy this unpredictable danger and death that can occur anywhere, anytime - "Masoye" will appear here It will never be just an accident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A small and thin old woman opened the door to them, greeted the men with a quiet and spacious courtyard, thick and soft and elastic like a carpet dwarf The Bermuda grass engulfed the largest part of the courtyard. The edge of the courtyard was occupied by dense ryegrass. A small and vigorous olive grove guarded the wings of the house. The low stone walls pierced the dense foliage and extended to the other end of the courtyard. Closely connected to another house, people can directly see the blue water, below the stone wall is more, countless dark green olive forest - just a short while, Hopkins also I saw a small grapefruit tree with golden fruit, and the door of the house was closed - perhaps because the owner of the house had come to the courtyard - as literally, Tang jumped from the wicker chair towards Hopkins They ran over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is about forty or fifty years old, his hair is already white, but he can still see that he is still full of energy and active, with more than three times the width and four of ordinary people. The body of the third level is as flexible and agile as ever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please forgive me," he said in a rich voice: "I can't meet you personally. It's unfortunate. Recently I have had some troubles - some The savage young man had some opinions on me.” Chegal regretfully loosened his shoulder: “My side is full of danger.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's really worrying," Hopkins said as if he were a pure, innocent foreign guest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter," Chegal extended his hand, and his nephew, Meyare, came straight down and their hands were held together. "I There is also a good helper, my good heir," Chegal said. "He is smarter than me, younger than me, more capable than me, and I am old--I am preparing to let him pick up my class, wait for this. After the matter was finished," Chegal said cheerfully: "I can put everything down without any worry - my benefactor, my guest, we can enjoy the sunshine, the fresh air, the hot springs, together. Mineral water, crisp and delicious pickled olives and lemon juice, wine... Hey, even if I think about it, I feel very happy - it seems that I am really ready to retreat."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Or please don't say this." Meyal interrupted his uncle's speech gently: "There is only one Tang, it is you." His tone is unusual. Resolutely: "Of course, I will deal with those annoying things as soon as possible, but You can safely catch sharks with your guests - you may need to rest for a while, but for a while, I will not let you go, I need to learn and rely on more Very much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They smile face to face, then look at the guests, the enthusiasm and urgent eyes make people feel that it is really something to say - for this Directly placed in the silver plate to hold in front of you, deep and sincere feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s really enviable," Hopkins said. "Cejal, you have a good boy."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," said Chegal, his face blushing, and the more fat nose than Meyare trembled uneasy in the morning air, as if he would always play Amazing sneeze, "Although I can't have a smart and beautiful son like you, but I have Meyare, he is enough to make up for all my shortcomings. I raised him, cultivated him, and will not be far away. In the future, I will hand over everything in my hands to my only heir, Meyare, who is my son, the old pig's beloved piglet." He used his strong forehead to rub Meyer's chin with his strong forehead: Ok, we have a lot of time to talk after, and now it’s time to play another role, come with me, the guests, the lovely old Andriana is ready for you – a Not inferior to the Romans and Florentines."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;& Nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
