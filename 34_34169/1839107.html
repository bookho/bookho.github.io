			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This medical facility is located at the junction of the three states, on a lone boulder on the vast desert plain, the building is very tall, square, gray exterior It is inlaid with a piece of shiny glass, and it is fortunate to have some glass. Otherwise, people will think that the "Babel Tower" depicted in the Bible has reappeared in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boulder is 30 stories high from the ground. If you want to go shopping in this quirky building, you can only use the intelligent computer in addition to the helicopter. Controlled elevators, of course, you can also imagine yourself as Spider-Man or Superman, along the rock can not be said to be smooth as a mirror but also a grassy surface climbs step by step, because there is no ladder, the construction of this building When people built scaffolding, the scaffolding was removed layer by layer after completion. So, although it is said that it has the first-class and most expensive newest equipment, doctors are highly screened, and it is said to be top-notch, and only a few "outsiders" have the opportunity or willing to receive treatment here - —Yes, this is an institution. The organization is wholly-owned. From land to construction, from equipment to personnel, there is no penny for taxpayers. So no one can slap on this expensive hospital and accuse it. The civilian population is useless – the institution will certainly not want to be an ordinary hospital where ordinary people can move in and out freely, except for doctors, nurses, guards and other necessary staff in the hospital. In addition to the inherent pattern of emergency centers, hospitalizations, radiology, infectious disease areas, etc., the institution’s “hunters” and “prey” are similar to the epidemic prevention agencies, new pathological research, and psychological research. Medical prosecutors and offices of forensic experts are used to deal with those who are inaccessible and unable to understand, or even know at all Special cases. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine was still unconscious when he was sent here, and had no impression of the grand appearance of the building, but for its interior, at least the "inside" "She is quite clear, because after her physical condition has improved slightly, the nurse here will open the window facing the inner courtyard very generously for her. If it is said, the appearance of this medical castle will be reminiscent of the Tower of Babel." Then, its inner inside is involuntarily thought to be in the sky garden of Babylon, although there is not much difference in the construction principle between the two, because the fertile soil is not possible on the boulder of the wasteland. The leafy trees grow, so this seemingly identical to any ancient courtyard that has been stretched for hundreds of years is also accumulated with money. People dumped nearly 3,000 tons of yellow mud and one here. Thousand tons of humus, creating artificial hills and gentle slopes, flats, streams, and then moving tall trees, low shrubs, lawns, clumps from other places Rosemary, lavender or thyme, poppy, rose and primrose, during which you can see the bees, there is a long tail bird moths, their lush grow here, seems to grow above the earth that. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If humans are as good at self-deception as these plant animals, maybe the days in this world will be much better, Catherine thought, "turn backwards!" she shouted Road, the wheelchair under her body immediately swung 180 degrees at a constant speed - the new product trial of the organization, I feel pretty good. Catherine looked up at the silent electronic clock in the ward, and the bright green LCD showed a bright green number of 9:30. She ordered the wheelchair to take her back to the bed, slowly stood up, moved to the bed, pulled the sheets and rested for a while, about an hour or so, the doctor came over to the patrol room, accompanied by a simple check, nurse, medication and injection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can I go out in the afternoon?" Catherine asked as the nurse pierced the needle into her skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doctor bowed his head and looked at her from the back of his eyes. His voice was a bit ambiguous because of the mask: "Yes," he clearly indicated: "You want to go to the yard... or somewhere else?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to see Sasha," Catherine said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"1:30 pm," the doctor gestured to another nurse: "Let the nurse Joan take you over. You can stay there." Ten minutes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine breathed a sigh of relief, she only knew that Sasha was still alive this morning (which made her ecstatic), and there was no Taken by his bastard father (really God bless!), and most importantly, his intensive care unit is less than 20 meters away from Catherine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not more than 20 meters, but down 20 meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the afternoon, Catherine was introduced by the nurse to the room, through the quiet hallway, the hall, the direct elevator, and then down, after coming out, it was a very warm, very bright small hall. There is only one passage connected to it. I don’t know where the speaker in the speaker is located in a section of Wagner’s four-act opera. The water elves of the Rhine sing the gold that lies deep in the bottom of the Rhine: “As long as there are men and women Those who have acquired these golds and use them to create the ring have the power to rule the world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The passage is short because it is almost the intensive care unit Outer corridor. Like many intensive care units, a part of the wall that connects the outer corridor is transparent glass from the waist. Catherine can observe the situation in the room through this colorless block. The other half of the room is computerized, various medical and The monitoring equipment is occupied by the doctors and nurses responsible for monitoring. They are also a transparent glass between the patient and the patient's room. The doctors and nurses inside can take care of the patients inside and outside. The real ward is compared with the former. To be gentler, the surface of the entire room is neither paint nor wallpaper, but a decorative board that looks very soft and clean. The top is light sky blue, the wall is moon blue, and the ground is ocean blue or It is a sapphire blue, and there is almost no gap in the splicing. The gray cloth with a pearly luster hangs on the side of the bed. It slightly blocks a few devices that are close at hand. The sheets and blankets on the bed are white, but above. With a golden constellation pattern, there is no cold ice, a sinister compact fluorescent lamp and an integrated fluorescent lamp. The light comes from the entire ceiling. Just like hair evening sky with light, Katherine does not know what that is, but she does not care about how this, her attention is all that prone on the bed of a child attracted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fluffy blond hair was cut to an unprecedented shortness, and Sasha squinted his head and turned to the left, sleeping heavily under the influence of drugs, even In his sleep, his brows are also wrinkled, and Catherine is familiar with this expression. This is not like a child's child often makes this kind of meditation or cold expression, unless he has made a decision, his brow will only Relax, even a little smile, but at the same time the eyes will become numb, Catherine does not like, very dislike, she stared at his serious little face for a while, only to find his arm hanging outside the blanket There is a dendritic red mark on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is that?" Catherine asked. "What problem does he have?" She knew that she was in a coma and was unable to take care of herself. It’s been a week, but Sasha is still in the intensive care unit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thunder strikes, there is no danger to life." The nurse replied: "In fact, he is in good condition. The reason why he stayed here is because doctors think he Still need to be observed for a while." After all, he is still only a six-year-old child, the nurse did not say, but she thinks Catherine should understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doctor told her that if Catherine asked about the situation in Sasha, she could answer it truthfully, but if Catherine did not ask or did not ask in detail And targeted, she does not have to one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
