			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blanche Dupont's room is the same as Brian's, on the first floor, ensuite, with separate kitchen and bathroom. She basically didn't use the kitchen, only occasionally brew some coffee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She cooked herself a cup of Italian espresso. The small, thick cup was preheated, and it was hot in the hand, and the dark brown liquid surface floated. The beige emulsion, which is only about two ounces in weight, is exceptionally effective, at least the exhaustion and slow thinking caused by excessive satiety are quickly leaving her. Two pieces of information were placed on her desk, one for Lila Lee and one for Chiz Carson. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s no surprise that Chiz Carson can enter Manchester, although it is well known that she was a deep addict (if she was just an ordinary person) Manchester is definitely not going to accept her), but her surname is Carson, her father and uncle are Manchester students, her grandfather is not, but he is the family of the Douglas family, he has almost determined that Chiz Carson is himself Heir, and Chiz's uncle has no children so far, she has three funds on her body, her father's, her grandmother's, her mother's, can be foreseen, ten years later, Manchester's alumni meeting will There is a wealthy "old friend" who is willing to donate big money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lilla. Lee is special, she is very lucky, even if it was three years ago, she would not be easy to enter Manchester. Yes, she has excellent grades, twice the community service time, and she has a wealth of extracurricular activities and work experience, with leadership skills. The problem is that she is a versatile person, and those who do not know are blessed by the devil. After the emergence of very cursed angels, they are almost synonymous with criminals and metamorphosis. Will Manchester recruit a potential criminal into his campus? No, this is the case. There are many things that are not fair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When did the situation change? It should have started from the locust incident. At the beginning, no one paid attention to the small bugs that were said to have been closely controlled, and perhaps leaked out. But what about that? Only a very small number of people will die because of the diseases caused by mites - but in a few months, the damn locusts appear everywhere in the western continent, and they are not many in number. Trembling chills - almost all of the family's farms, manors, and other privately owned territories, their children were bitten, and some of them were short-lived fever. Pain, itchy skin; others are much more serious, and there are all kinds of strange phenomena. Some hospitals have exploded, and some medical personnel have been thrown into the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where does the “institution” know about these situations? The families of the young patients are not known, but now is not the time to get to the bottom. The riots of the abilities are mostly in the early stage. In many cases, they can both the lives of the people around them and the lives of the sins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people wonder if these locusts were made by "institutions" and their children suddenly became "strange people" (they have always called this abilities Is it caused by those locusts? This can be said to be the biggest conspiracy ever brewed by the "institution" - the result can be said to be, or can not be said, because "institutions" rely on the ability of a competent member. Evidence has been obtained that these white little bugs were created by the organization "Samel", which was split from the "institution". Even so, it cannot be said that locusts have created abilities. The substances contained in their liquids can only be said to be a catalyst. Only those who have the potential of the abilities will be violently triggered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But if there are no locusts," Blanche said to himself: "Is he/she will be a normal person for the rest of his life?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Institution" has objections to this. But there are many people who think so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The benefits are obvious, and now even the president has to put up a hostile attitude towards "institutions." They need their members to appease and balance. There are too many children to suppress and take care of. They are also a generation that will have a brilliant future. Just like their little cousin, he is the youngest child, smart, beautiful, and has a rare and ordinary love in children. The temperament, he is the grandson of his grandfather, and his grandfather is the family of the DuPont family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, he did not grow two tongues and fly-like compound eyes that collapsed (Blancher saw it in the "institutional" staff), He is only enhanced his eyesight. It is a relatively common abilities. Before he can learn how to adjust, every move requires supervision and care. He can't figure out how far the walls and plates are from himself or the bathtub. Where the water was placed, he quietly said to Blanche that he was worried that he would become an asexual, because he saw everyone's face covered with hills, basins and parasites. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A woman named Catherine and another person from the "institution" are responsible for caring and guiding him, the latter is also an abnormally developed person, and Catherine can The thoughts and feelings of others are passed on to others, so that something that cannot be described in words can be accepted by DuPont without any mistakes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
