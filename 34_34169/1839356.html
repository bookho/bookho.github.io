			<div id="content">The <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; section may be abandoned by the workers in the bushes of the aluminum u-shaped trench into a paradise for kittens. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After two days, someone reflected that the dormitory’s drowning and gully leaked, and the tutor in the dormitory immediately called the worker to repair it. This pipeline is probably because of the worker’s belt. The trench that was replaced was too long, and he was too lazy to bring back the pipe that was cut down less than three feet long. He just found a lush corner and threw it away. This is still a bright aluminum trench. One just happened to rest under an abandoned artificial bird's nest, and the other fell into a fluffy soft wick. The inclination was about forty to forty-five. The kitten climbed out of the nest and tried to sneak down the sulcus. Like the children's slides, they think it's a very fun and meaningful game, and their mothers don't take it as a human mother. They even think it's dangerous. It stands carefully and carefully. Next, seeing that the child slipped down, he took it back to the nest - this nest is likely to be used by this mother as his own nest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are four kittens, and there is only one cat mother, it smashes back, and that slides down again, and squats back, and this slides again— - The kitten has been crying in mischief, and this is what they heard from Besib. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This can't be done," Lila said. "We have to take that." The groove is up, the surface is smooth, and the problem is the part it is cut off. Sharp is like a knife reaching out into the air, swaying, legs and feet weak kittens jumping in turns, actually did not open their stomachs or tear open cheeks, can only say that God is watching them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She just wanted to get close, the cat mother turned abruptly, her ears leaned back, yelling at her and fangs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe the lavender smell on my body is too strong." Lila said slyly, taking back her dry lavender from Sasha's arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will try." Besib said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is even worse. When he was close, not only the big cat, but even the kitten began to panic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib is going backwards. The big cat did not put down the vigilance as it did just now. Its ears were almost close to the head, and the beard was folded back, and the arched back was accompanied by the erected coat. The pupils are enlarged and the body is stiff – all of which explains that if you don’t take any further action, it will be desperate to attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, huh." Lila whispered in sorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Brother," Besib calmly said: "It's yours."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sand waited for a while before the action began. His feet gently stepped into the pile of wicks, the kitten was still whispering, the big cat stood still vigilantly, but the tail and coat that was laid down showed its current feeling. It was not as bad as it was at the beginning - it looked at the human being with a curious look full of humanity - Sasha carefully approached a step and he reached out. The finger has been able to touch the big cat's cheeks. He gently strokes the beard to the sides of his cheeks. The cat's cheeks secrete something called "pheromone", the smell of this kind of thing. Will make the cat emotionally stable and touch this place. Can make the cat feel very comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"喵~" Big cat said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha's fingers move from the cheeks to the back of the cat's head, then the shoulders, waist, hips, tail... When he retracts his hand, the big cat is soft Shouting and turning around. Unsatisfiedly licking his palm with his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My brother." Besib proudly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha picked up the big cat, it has no collar, it is not like being raised, but it raises itself well, the fur is cow color Bright and fluffy. Black and white, muscles strong, about twelve pounds, Sasha lifted it up and put it in the nest. It uneasily stretched out his head, looked at the kittens, and kept screaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't worry." Sasha said that he only lifted a kitten that rolled into a ditch in the ditch. The kitten was very light and the legs and legs were still Very weak, black fur, only four small claws are white, black kittens in white socks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last kitten has slipped to the bottom of the ditch, nestled in the wick, and Sasha grabbed it to make it very unhappy, with a thin The small teeth bite the thumb of Sasha, and Sasha put it next to his mother and brothers and sisters. After a while, it completely forgot about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha mentioned the aluminum gutter and returned to Lila and Besib. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's a bird's nest," Besib said. "It's quite big."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The longest place is a foot,” Sasha said. “The big tits, the crows, the red-tailed owls are all possible.” Grande is a beautiful place with abundant grass and wood, not only living in a variety of wild species. Birds and beasts, there are many unowned dogs and cats, but the number of the latter is gradually decreasing. In addition to being adopted, suffering from diseases and accidental injuries, it has become a fox and a mole. Only unregistered cats and dogs were given a free ligation opportunity in the “trap/alter/release” rescue operation that was finally formalized and legalized – they never again May leave their own offspring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, although the students and teachers of Grande are very fond of these unfortunate non-humans, here, it is difficult to see the newborn Cats and puppies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This cat should have been around for a while," Lila said. "She may have entered the Grande with her big belly - she is there. "Children are born in the nest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is a fixed feeding point from the bird's nest but a few hundred feet," Besib said: "It Very smart, so that it doesn't have to leave their children for too long."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, Sasha cooked a little fish with olive oil, Besib I ate one. "Does this need a dipping sauce?" He said: "It's very light."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's not for you," Sasha said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are going back to Grand Town this weekend," Beppe said. "Doctor Hopkins has applied and is allowed."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He and Besib know why - in the newspapers, on television, and even in the course there are news about Orlosa - when they leave On the day of Orlosa, at 12 o'clock in the middle of the night, the one led by the Cloven family, or the war broke out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is that Yelena?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Which one are you talking about?" Beppe said: "We only got the news of Cloven's wife--he seems to have no intention of concealing it. After all, no one will pay attention to those little people at that time--the family is really unlucky, brother. , sister, nephew, together with my parents, when driving to visit the diamond pit, the distance is too close, their car is planted down, exploding, burning, burning is really very good, when finding a way to go down, inside can The things picked up are less than twenty pounds."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
