			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Hopkins appeared in the dim light of the performance hall, and the messy scene in front of him did not cause him too much attention, he looked up The gray hair is not in a mess, tightly attached to the round skull, and the thin nose rushes into the air, which looks like a humanoid skeleton. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked forward, and the slender legs gently touched the cat's sable fur without lifting, lifting the tough and powerful tail of the first female tiger. Like a snake swimming in the air, it passed the doctor's thigh, and the tip was beautifully bent over the knee - Dr. Hopkins felt like a real whip or a stick. Knock on the flesh. He stopped and looked at the beautiful lady who was just in the middle of the body. The dark blue hazelnuts of human beings gradually infiltrated the color of the wine. The female tiger made a soft mutter from the throat, turned his head and regained his limbs. Coordinated and softly moved, but it was a blink of an eye, it was immersed in the darkness of a little, like a gold powder sprinkled with ink, and the other three tigers followed it closely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doctor stood in the field for a while, then continued through the dumped chair and messy decorative ribbons. The monkeys watched in the distance and made a vigilant cry. The little poodles, which were collectively squatting on the side of the monkey cage, huddled together in horror. They looked like some kind of whistling, growing a lot of dog heads. The hairy monster. Dr. Hopkins did not mind rushing them out, letting the things under the wet body of the puppies completely reveal them - those things look like dinner widows treated by garbage shredders, doctors Pick up a hard object with a creamy yellow color and squint for about thirty seconds. Make sure it is a human gum, his fingers are in the arc in the air, so the virtual muscles and skin stick through his mind. On the bones covered with tiny marks, a woman's jaw, aged between 20 and 22, was clearly established in the doctor's brain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bone was placed under the nose by Anthony Hopkins, biting a bite with his teeth, tasting her taste, and the wonderful music was in his Reverberating in the skull - Wagner's prelude, the violin sang "the motive of love", and immediately connected with "passionate motivation." Then the wood tube suddenly played briskly, and soon the bass string boiled "fast motion machine". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, that is to say, before he was ten years old, every Christmas, the heavy brass phonograph with a black horn on the house would Putting on the album of this opera, this is a summoning order, and it is an invitation card. Relatives and friends gather in their manor to spend the whole cold winter. Everyone smiles and is neatly dressed. In Sacos, etc. The sons and singers represented by the two singers ate and drank, even his sister, who was still in the babysitter’s arms, was also taken out and took a milk liqueur... Hey, hey, hey. Ah, now it’s the flute and the oboe that play the melody in the high-pitched area. The parents of Anthony danced and the guests followed, and he held the soft, milky body of the sand in the adults. The waist and the legs are shaking, her eyes are like shining stars, and the cheeks are as flawless as jade... When did it all end? Mr. Anthony Hopkins later investigated that his parents were killed six months before his ten-year-old Christmas, seven months before the end of the war, and that the destruction and encroachment of the manor was Two months before Christmas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The victory party played a brilliant march with brass instruments as the mainstay, and the defeated soldiers rushed into the manor with guns and they rushed I’ve gone to a few adults and kept the children in the cellar—Anthony Hopkins smelled the smell in the cellar that was deep in the mind and covered with a lid. It was like The newly killed chicken opened the sac and the sac bag, and the smell of the unwashed, blood-sucking pig when it was stewed in hot water - he quickly flew to the black hole with this taste. The wine cellar slipped, just like when it snowed down from the top of the hillside, the back was cold and cold, the wind screamed in the ear, the hands and feet swayed in the air, and there was no place to grab. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peng, he fell to the end, the night horn of the night horn from the bottom of Mr. Hopkins's skull to the temple - the children curled up together, Sasha hidden in his arms, they are cold and hungry, came from outside the door The complaints of the squadron - they ate the food of the manor and then went hunting in the forest near the manor, but the blizzard arrived, they never went out again, a dozen big men, huddled in the manor’s living room, They spit everywhere, and they smashed the velvet curtains as a cover, and smashed the exquisite and gorgeous furniture into a firewood. In the original living room, there was a very beautiful armchair in front of the fireplace. The armchair with brocade cushions was early. It was demolished in a few days, and there was a plush-skinned step stool. They took the suede step stool into the garden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door of the warehouse was opened, and the children were taken out by the adults one by one, saying that they were "playing", but no one had come back, and finally One day, a man caught Anthony. He stroked and kneaded his arms, legs and body, but in the end he chose Sasha. She was dragged out of Anthony's arms rudely, although the boy had done his best and desperately hugged - she was like a little deer caught by these squadrons in the past few days, put a rope around her neck and was pulled Stumbled, reluctantly followed the grown-ups, his face covered with tears - Anthony followed closely, and when he tried to rush out of the warehouse, he was cut off by the door that was suddenly closed. He fell to the ground, in pain and darkness. Pray to God, pray that you can see your only relatives again. He hopes to have such a day, once again in the lush garden, use the warm water of the sun to bathe the chubby little Sasha, tease with a fat eggplant. She is happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha likes purple, he knows, the purple reflection of eggplant is in her clean eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His wishes were met for a small part, and he saw a few white, delicate likes on the walnut step stool in the garden. It is a deciduous tooth carved by an angel and a few pale hairs scattered in brown smudges and snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——So when people are shocked by his special hobbies, Mr. Anthony Hopkins always has a pure question or thought. - Since God allows a pure and sinless child like Sasha to be eaten, who else in the world can't be added to his recipe? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very smart and very good at learning. After completing most of the studies that are difficult for ordinary people, Anthony Hopkins began to get involved in psychology, history, time. The major issues of space and space - extracted from the ancient literature, found in the latest science and technology, guided by the absurd metaphysics, paved the way with rigorous and practical calculations - all goals point to one direction, he I hope that time goes back, going back to the dark warehouse, going back to the moment when Sasha was still in his arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After meeting Catherine, he has a new topic - that is, if she can find a new shelter for Sasha, then she can Can't you resurrect in this world? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went to do it, fortunately, Catherine finally recognized this idea - he led Catherine into his memory of memory, from the sun The flowery and clean water tub starts to go to the dark, stinking cellar, the footstool with snow and blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thinks that Catherine has a part of Sasha, and Catherine believes that he also has a part of Sasha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He likes this idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he hoped, after about two to three years, Sasha found another place in Catherine’s house, and she returned. It is the same as the image in his memory, pink cheeks, slender pale golden curls, purple with eggplant in his eyes, chubby, heavy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
