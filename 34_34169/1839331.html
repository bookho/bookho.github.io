			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cade immediately knew that he had made a mistake, and when Mrs. Carson licked her lips and wanted to turn and walk away, he did the right thing— - He rushed over, gathered his arms and held her tightly in his arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She struggled and kicked quietly and angrily in his arms, he did not shake it, just bowed his head and gently bite her neck, shoulders , and the chest, sucking her smell, he can feel that he has inflated to the limit, he sticks to her, so that she can also feel the heavy heat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has been a man since he became a man for twenty years, but only a woman can make him so madly caught in the whirlpool, he saw her at the wedding She is the bride, his nephew, and when she wiped his shoes in her large, white skirt, he snarled and almost fainted; when John Carson and her went to honeymoon, he Like a beast that is locked in a cage, there is no day and night, and repeatedly stepping between the square inches, the face is green and white, and the look is stunned. Every moment I think about how to beat his brother. , drive him away, tear him apart, and seek his rightful right from him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He clearly remembers the first time they kissed, hugged and made love - they were happy in the heavy rain - he kissed her every inch The skin, the cold skin quickly became hot, emitting a natural aroma from her body, like a peony, like a musk, he almost suffocated, his palms holding her slender waist, Like holding a crown, fingertips against her spine, he sinks deep in her, her abdominal muscles are tight, her fingers are deeply inserted into the black mud, and the rain blooms on her body. A tiny flower with crystal clear eyes - throughout the process, she kept her eyes closed, biting her lips, and her expression was painful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, his brother, John Carson, was observing the strange way of making love for the tortoise in the warm waters of the South Pacific. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Mrs. Carson opened his eyes, it was already the next day. At noon, some parts of her body were still numb. When she went to the bathroom, she found herself bleeding, but she couldn’t care so much. Since that incident, she has never let Chiz Carson Stay alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cade wants to send her, by the way to see Chiz, she refused, she knows that Chiz does not like this uncle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was patient and drove back to the lakeside villa alone. The villa was quiet, and the servant greeted her and whispered to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dad?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man sitting at the bedside of Chiz Carson turned back Come, look sad, he holds the hand of Chiz Carson, the other hand raised to the lips, made a "beep" gesture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He carefully and carefully took his hand from Chiz’s hand, stuffed the girl’s hand back into the warm blanket, stood up and walked out of the room, Carson The lady is behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She didn’t dare to be too close to her father. When she came out, she was too hasty. She just rushed a shower, no perfume, she didn’t know her father. A keen sense of smell will not catch any unpleasant smell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They sat down in the living room, and the servant came to the tea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Carson was hungry on the way, but now she doesn’t feel hungry at all. She sits on the opposite side of her father with trepidation, her palms on her knees. It’s like an underage girl who has been caught by the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her father glanced at her and he had no hope for this daughter, but he was determined to be no more than twenty years ago. It is impossible to have her own child, she is his only blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Carson noticed that her father was wearing a very careful dress today, a black pure wool coat, the same texture of dark gray striped pants, a traditional inline fold Playing white pocket towel, small collar, white shirt with decorative folds, light gray satin vest, black lace-wing sneakers, black socks - he must have just come back from a certain jockey and then drive directly Look at his granddaughter daughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have no important things to come here," her father said coldly, neither asking her where she went last night, nor blaming her for not being there. Daughter: "I just came to see Chiz, and, in July of this year, I want to take her out and walk around."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But doctor Say..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man waved his hand and interrupted his daughter’s words: "You don't know what Chitz really needs," he said sternly. "In July, you will also go together and be prepared. I will let my assistant inform you of the specific time and place."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
