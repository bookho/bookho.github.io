			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were two screams and screams that were absolutely not human. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They killed them." Besib whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yeah." Sasha said that the voice is lower than Besib. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two children’s hands were tightly held together, and Besib found himself running with Sasha – although the latter stayed on the island for only two Less than a month, but he behaved as if he was born here - like the second individual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib can judge that they are going down the cliff, he doesn’t know if this is correct, but it doesn’t matter because of the dangerous noise Approaching, in all directions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little Hopkins did not plan to practice a long-distance run with a boy late at night, especially in the case of a group of wolves following the ass - - Their destination is not far from the house of "Tang". It is also located in the depths of the roadway, the same black iron gates as the neighbors, the towering walls, the narrow courtyard, the darkness of the room, no light, There is no sound either. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are where they go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside the sadness of Besib’s heart, this should be around the most solid and reliable shield of “Tang” Chegal, now this shield wall It was like being piled up by the sand, and it was scattered by the waves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who is waiting here?" Maybe it would be Big Hopkins, Besib thought, this elusive outsider loves him very much. Son - For some unspeakable reasons, Besib did not find his true thoughts - he hoped to see Chegal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is best not to have it." Sasha said: "I don't even know my father here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;He did not turn on the lights, the two children walked through the living room, dining room and into the kitchen in the dark. As we said before, most of the buildings on the sea god island have a basement, and the exits of the basement are mostly arranged in the kitchen. In the sand, Sasha opened a strange wooden door, and the salty wind poured directly from below, picked up the hem of the clothes and blew it on the bare skin, and Bessie sneezed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passing back and forth in the passage, Sasha took the lead and went down. Besib followed. He didn't forget to close the door. He hesitated, not sure if the latch should be inserted, and the bolts that were not thick enough were too big. Obstruction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't care about it." Sasha did not say back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They walked down the black ladder, and Besib heard a light, crisp click, like the sound of a lock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no light in the passage from beginning to end, but this does not hinder anything. Sasha and Besib can rely on extremely weak light like cats. Look at things, their eyes are shining in the darkness, the silver is the sand, and the eyes of Besib are golden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So far, the slippery moss on the stone steps is the biggest problem they have encountered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real problem is still behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If this is a movie," Besib murmured: "I will drink it."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if it is Sasha, many times in the mind, the matter is far better than the peers and even some of the adult's little Hopkins, can not help but have a very short blank time ... he is himself The set route and the caves have been considered to be perfect, but the problem is also on the “for yourself” – the road stands between the outward waterway and the mantle, and Sasha deliberately keeps the iron gate between the welds. The gap is enough to spread the sand sideways - but not Beb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib’s face was squashed on the fence. “Obesity is the enemy, the doctor is not wrong,” he said desperately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s not flesh, it’s bones." Sasha said: "It’s awful. If his father is here, he should be able to solve this trouble, maybe pain, but definitely not. Fatal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib apparently shrank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little Hopkins floated on the other side of the fence, and a subtle sound came from the top of his head. He reached for the wet hair and listened carefully. : "They are coming."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib also heard, "There is no way, you are going," he urged firmly. "They are coming to me...The Madonna bless..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;Sasha stretched out his hand from the gap between the fences and grabbed the face of Besib: "If that is true," he blinked. "We still have hope."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib feels that his face has become hot and a little hot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Try it," Sasha said. "If you really have Chelsea's blood in your body."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib is almost scared. Yes, he is a child of Chegal, but his mother is an outsider. She has not married anyone. She has only been with Chegarer for only a few days. This is very common on Poseidon. As long as you are courageous, young and beautiful, and have referrals, there will always be a month or two in the year for the girls to make a fortune - Besib is a real accident, the first 50 years of Chegal Without children, he didn't expect to have it in the next 50 years - but since he did, he would not be stupid enough to give up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Celegal considered having married his mother of Besib, but Meyare has been his heir for nearly two decades, and he can say that he has not performed well. Bad, let an incompetent baby replace him, even if Chegarian dementia to diaper pants will not do this, although he really wants to see his own son took the "Massoy" scepter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gave his son a name and then handed him over to the most trusted subordinates. The identity of Besib’s identity is almost unfair, except for his father. . And only Chekale, Besib, Pepi (his nominal father), and old Andreana, who know this, may now add the size of Hopkins, and... Meyer . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A subordinate child is not worthy of Meyare’s time spent chasing at this critical moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bessib’s brain turned into a hot sizzle, and when he was awakened by the cold water, he didn’t figure out how he passed through. Fenced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha is very interested, even if he rarely has the opportunity to play with human plasticine, perhaps because he is the leader, as if melting The deformed head and body are not only horrible but rather cute, although...somewhat sequelae, he reached out and grabbed the chin of Besib, and the other hand grabbed the nose and moved it to the correct position— - If it is not a time-critical relationship, Sasha may continue to challenge and study - when the nose moves to the cheeks, does the back of the nose, nose, olfactory nerves, etc. follow the movement? If not, how does he maintain his breathing? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, Sasha is very clear. Now is not a good time to learn. The above movements are already very obvious. The little guy who has been transformed and has a vulgar surface and a hard and solid inside has brought a lot of tracers to the followers. trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone cursed loudly, the dog screamed desperately, and the gunshots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where is the boat?" The calm water is empty, Besib is moving his neck, he still feels weird and dull, and the body is like a stopper. Full of cotton. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No boat." Sasha said, "I have something better."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the passage, there was a wheezing sound of water, and two tiny water marks were drawn across the water. The long, long kisses and rounded heads appeared in front of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha gestured to Besib to take a deep breath, then dive into the water, and Bessie learned how he would give the smooth streamline body a deepest hug. , leaning down the body, one side of the cheeks close to the fins of the dolphins, wisdom is equivalent to the human child's creatures docilely and quietly waiting for them to put themselves in place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But when they rushed out, Besib almost screamed because of the terrible acceleration, and those who have never experienced it absolutely can’t imagine Feeling - the sea comes on the surface, wraps you, washes you, invades you, in a few minutes, it can occupy every cell in your body, the vision and hearing, the sense of smell completely lost its effect, don't Bu can only barely hold his hands, just like embracing his own life, and the same is true. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The passage is about one hundred and thirty feet, and the average speed of the long dolphins is about twenty miles per hour. They carry Sasha and Bessie. When Bu rushed out of the passage, the people of Meyare had just rushed down the stairs of the mantle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two minutes later, they surfaced again, slowing down, even then, Besib still felt like he was drifting up, compared to even It can be said that Sasha, who is shouldering shoulder to shoulder with him, seems to be much more comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besb’s thigh was touched by something. He struggled to turn his head and look at it and saw nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dolphins put two children on a quiet shoal surrounded by huge rocks. The shadows shroud the sea, and there was not much sunshine even in the day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
