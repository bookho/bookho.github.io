			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uncontrollable forces may bring disaster, but no power will make you ruin in disaster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one can understand this sentence better than Anthony Hopkins. He also had a fragile period of youth and ignorance. At that time, he lost. His parents, home, and sister Sasha; then in the orphanage, charity boarding school, fourteen years in college, and later in human society with his unparalleled mind, sensitive organs, steel The feelings of the bones and the rich experience that has been innumerable in the past two decades have greatly enhanced this impression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine has extraordinary power, Anthony Hopkins is also, as their child, the power of Sasha Hopkins from his full moon It appeared, and reached its first peak at the end of the third summer after it came to the world; when Anthony Hopkins and him were in the depths of the Amazon jungle far from the human industrial, commercial civilization. It is crowded with kudzu, orchids, bromeliad plants and crocodiles, Mori, and the only thing with traces of the 21st century is probably the round scar left by Dr. Hopkins’s left hand after removing the deformed sixth finger. . Without much consideration, Dr. Hopkins can almost be said to have forced Sasha, who was only three years old at the time, into his own spirit, just as he led Sasha’s mother Catherine into his memory many years ago. The palace is like that. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this is not so early, for example, after five years, even four years, then Anthony Hopkins can also teach How does Sha establish his own palace in the spiritual world and skillfully store and store his memory and power in it - just as he always has memories of the stinking black hole of that winter (Note 1) In the cellar that is difficult to reach and open, Sasha can also hide the special power that is temporarily out of his body completely in a room... but unfortunately, Sasha was very smart at the time, but still too small. Small even can't control their own power, let alone suppress them under their own reason - Dr. Hopkins has to open his own world, in his territory, the tall and majestic mansion stands in the middle of the house. The blue-gray tower is flanked by dark brown marble wings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The end of the tower is a small room, which was stationed on the top from the fifteenth to the nineteenth centuries. As a night whistle, pay attention to the mansion and the surrounding woods. There were flames and thieves in the middle, but in the past two hundred years, it has become an empty place to rest. Later, Dr. Hopkins put some specimens that were hand-picked inside - of course, they are no longer Exist, the power of Sasha is too great, and the big one can almost crush everything into powder. Fortunately, he always remembers his father’s jealousy. If he does not want to dig his head out, he will Control as much as you can, control those violent, intangible things, and let them crouch quietly in the small room with a pointed hat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This door was closed by Anthony Hopkins and Sasha Hopkins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, they want to open it and release the trapped beasts that have been imprisoned for thousands of days and nights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door opened a gap. At first, nothing happened. It looked dark and dark, but Sasha could see a little silver flash, just like the beast in the fur. The force opened one eye, then the second one, the third one, the fourth one... The light spots were so quickly assembled into a line, and then they became a piece, and they became a face, eventually gathering into a bright wave, rushing to , instantly extinguished the top. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Hopkins opened his eyes and he stepped back two Step, he can't see the things that are hidden, but they can feel them... they are producing, growing, extending – he indulges them through their bodies and provokes those deep in the bone marrow and brain The power of this feeling can be described as long gone, but still makes him feel comfortable. "Ghoul" stretches out his hands, fingers are inserted into the smooth, hard surface of the electromagnetic door like a hot fork inserted into the solidified butter, and they are torn open, then he crosses the twisted metal and stands Because the outer barrier was attacked and immediately opened in front of the high-voltage electric wall - he also had such a device outside the room of the State Baltimore Psychiatric Hospital, but it was not so advanced, and the reinforced glass partition became transparent because of the passage of current. He can see his child, Sasha Hopkins quietly stands behind the glass partition wall, the attack has just extinguished the lights in the room, no matter the day and night, but the glare of the current can still produce Dr. Hopkins was able to tell the location of Sasha, the child’s eyes were shining in the darkness, and he made a gesture of “keep the distance” to Sasha... The man’s finger pressed on the tempered glass and passed. In a few seconds, starting from the side wall, everything disappeared into powder without any warning, the thick glass partition disappeared, and the current of the conductor was lost in the air. A small buzzing sound shook the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Hopkins patiently waited until the current disappeared completely, and the darkness came. He gently lifted a foot and stepped into the powder of the glass. His fingers touched the sand, then his arm, and he took the child. Hugged up and hugged tightly in the chest - in these few months, Sasha Hopkins was at least four to five pounds lighter, but he was about an inch and a half taller, and Hopkins estimated it. I found that this growth rate is still within the normal range - he snorted with satisfaction, as long as the weight, as long as there is a comfortable and safe living environment and adequate, nutritious food, drinking water, will soon be able to raise back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leave here." Sasha said that his voice was as dumb and deep as an adult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course," Dr. Hopkins said: "There is no doubt."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before turning around, he observed the whole room (the darkness did not hinder Anthony Hopkins), quickly, but he thought he had seen everything he wanted to see, before he left the room, he Squeezing the air full of plastic scorch, and sticking out the tongue between the gaps of the teeth until the saliva in the air cools in the flowing airflow, just like a piece of others can't see and touch Meat. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he finally walked out of the electromagnetic door that was deformed to the ground, he glanced at the monitoring probe that did not know whether it had been destroyed by the residual current. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g The person in charge of the district stared at the monitor screen, looking blue and blue Hey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A suspected poisoner who was mistakenly released by a nervously guarded guard suddenly tore open the metal door and brought out Sasha Hopkins - this is no big deal, They are still in the g zone, and the g zone has been blocked. The electromagnetic doors on both ends can only be opened after ten minutes. Do not want to open them by any means (they are different from the room door, filled with concrete) And ten minutes later - they can take the bastard that should have been sent to the electric chair without a hitch... He wouldn't think that the child in his hand could be taken hostage? The person in charge suddenly thought of this. His chin was slightly tightened, but he immediately relaxed. He knew every household in the g district. A small hybrid of a criminal, the institution might order him to save the case if he could. The child’s life, but if it is not, or if something unexpected happens, he will not be charged with it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Institutions are not the FBI that will foolishly succumb to the pressure of public opinion, but the ministry, bureau, etc. They know how to protect themselves. people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Hopkins stands in the hallway, lights in the hallway Still intact, the electromagnetic doors of other rooms were still very securely parked in place, and the situation in Sasha did not affect the outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that everything is fine, and the Ghoul reveals an unidentified smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fluctuations and eddy currents that humans and instruments can’t detect are spreading out from the center of the father and son. Its speed cannot be said to be fast, but it is not good. Resist, can't be destroyed - they pass through the air, metal, concrete, glass and human body, and work in their nerves, Anthony Hopkins looks up, he can't feel like Sasha and Catherine The emotions of others can be perceived as malicious and murderous like real wild animals. Behind those heavy electromagnetic doors, there are pulsating fresh hearts that are wrapped around a solid body, above the heart. It is a brain full of venom, and all three of them are responding to the power that has been banned for a long time... It whispers, rolls up, sweeps all desires and powers, and makes them more Inflated and strong... like Anthony Hopkins, the cute little creatures in the Amazon jungle, and the residents of the g district feel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
