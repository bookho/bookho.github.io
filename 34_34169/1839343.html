			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ps:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the second more today! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who have just arrived in Orlosa will wonder why the people of Orlosa are suddenly keen to hold a luxurious dinner and dance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although diamonds are produced here, those who dig diamonds have never enjoyed the benefits of diamonds. The people who first dig diamonds were exiled to this, lamenting that "all the warmth in life has left me", ragged, barefooted ankles, criminals with wooden sticks and shovel; again by the nobles The flocks took the land and forced them to seek a peasant and a small craftsman in this ghost town where the winter could last for ten months. After the king was driven away, it was said that it was a big hand for every citizen. A group of workers and their families forcibly moved here and established a city for them, Orlosa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other parts of the world, diamond-seeking workers can rely on the small stones in their hands to get a big bonus, only the workers in Orlosa Holding a fixed meager salary – the workers complained painfully: “We are mining gems for the most beautiful women in the world, and the money we get is only enough to buy bread for the whole family to eat,” Orlosa’s restaurants and The hotel is prepared for officials and tourists and merchants who buy diamonds here. The machines hidden in the ground and ceiling ensure that they are warm and clean, while other parts of Orlosa are hydrogen sulfide emitted from diamond pits. The gas is shrouded in their hair and clothes, and the skin is full of smell of rotten eggs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do they have the mind and the financial resources to eat, drink and dance? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only a handful of people who hold dances and dinners. Most of them don’t do it because they like it. They just flatter themselves. Competing for favors - who doesn't know, the leader of the northern mob, Mrs. Crowe, who is over 80 years old, likes dinner and dance most? But to ensure safety, she never holds a ball herself, and she does not invite people to dinner, but if she stays somewhere. Just happened to meet someone else at a dance party or dinner party. She would appear in front of the owner without warning and without notice, sometimes she would not even see her master. Just hurriedly danced a dance or two, and drinking a few glasses of liqueur will leave as quiet as you came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowadays, it is less and less that Mrs. Crowe can relax. Because of this, she is very generous to those who can make her smile. If the owner of the ball is a mob, he will get a certain improvement; If he is a businessman, he will be able to reduce the various "fees" for two to three years; if he is an official, he will get a large amount of political contributions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Crowe especially likes the masquerade because she can hide behind the mask and jump on nearly half of the night, so soon. Everyone knows what kind of dance to hold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dancer behind this evening, the owner behind is Constantine Cloven. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The invitation to the ball was sent to wealthy businessmen and officials, and a small number of foreign guests who could spend a lot of money in Orlosa were invited, two or three. Hundreds of people danced in the halls with large and deep floors and parquet floors. The background is dark oak siding and magnificent silk wall coverings, and the long windows are covered by thick brown jacquard curtains, leaving no gaps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the requirements of the prom master, everyone dressed in a black velvet mask, dressed as a nobleman from the seventeenth to eighteenth centuries - men wearing lace The white shirt with the collar and cuffs, a silk scarf with a silk outside, and a blue jewel outside the shirt. Squid red or emerald green silk vest with delicate embroidery on it, vest buttons are generally more than 30, one grain next to one, only one-third or half of them have real effect Others are decorations. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only some of the men who don’t feel comfortable with their pants and shoes. The 18th-century aristocrats wore shorts to the knees, buttons at the knees, and white stockings underneath, and they could wear high heels or boots. But they must all be lambskin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women's clothing We only need to refer to the suit that Kaide Carson prepared for his brother's survivors, except for velvet, thick, satin And silk is also the best material for large skirts. They all have layers of embroidery, and sparkling crystals, glass and artificial diamonds. Of course, the nobles should use diamonds. Colored stones and pearls to dress up. However, a large part of today's costumes are the host of the dance party, which is specially prepared in advance to guarantee the quality of the dance, and lends to those guests who are not prepared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to clothes, they also offer a variety of decorative accessories, such as men's feather hats, chain pocket watches, walking sticks and gloves, ladies' jewelry, pouches, waist chains, unisex wool wigs, where needed A makeup artist who cuts the moon into the moon, water droplets and a black velvet piece in the shape of a carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soundproofing of the hotel room is very good, not to mention the dance will be held on the first floor, while Carson’s room is on the sixth floor and is called to take care of the daughter of Chiz Carson. The waiter huddled in the chair by the bed, looking at the girl with the ointment on his nose, breathing smoothly, and there was a diamond hairpin in the girl's unkempt hair. Is it a real diamond? She thought, it should be true, but she did not have the courage to "take", the people who can live in this suite are not rich and expensive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sat for a while, the music in the fantasy was drilled into her mind, she probably only endured for five minutes, and crept I took off my shoes and ran into the small living room in the suite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The small living room is empty, she opens the box, the misty rose dress is lying quietly inside, she can’t help but reach out and touch It, put it up, on itself, in front of the mirror; she hugged the dress, barefoot dancing on a soft, soft sheared carpet, she was dancing with a young, handsome, rich man It’s like a man who brought these two beautiful clothes today, his body is filled with the scent of saffron, not the smell of rotten eggs, his arms are strong, his manners are elegant...<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waitress was shocked, she stumbled and turned away, that The little girl was standing by the door, in her pajamas, staring blankly at her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I..." she said in a panic: "I...I’m just sorting out the clothes..." She lifted the dress and thanked it. The clothes are not taffeta, she will not leave a fingerprint on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My mother?" Chiz asked: "Was this dress, where did the clothes come from? I don't remember if we brought this dress." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your father sent it," the waitress said happily. "He also sent your mother a velvet dress. They went down to the dance." - Leave me here to take care of you, do you want to drink milk? Or cake, and chocolate?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where is the dance," said Chiz, both eyes bright and strange, she looked at her clothes: "Help me change clothes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't want to check it out?" Chiz wiped off the ointment and said, "They have told you to follow me." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waitress did not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don’t like this dress," said Chiz, "I have a thick dress," she said, pointing to the waiter: "This dress is for you, hurry. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one mask for the clothes, and Chiz gives the waiter, "What clothes are they wearing?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your mother's piece is dark green, velvet, your dad's piece is gray-green glossy satin, very matching."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Chiz smiled weirdly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's go." She said: "And, that man is not my father."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The waitress was blushing, and she was very nervous when she was walking in the hallway, especially when two waiters bowed to them and wished they had a good time, but they didn’t recognize it. She is coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gave her a lot of confidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QiZi did not have any effort to find her mother and her uncle in the vortex of satin and fake jewels, and the tenderness between them was a blind man. I can also see that she feels sick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Someone invited the waitress to dance, and she looked at Chiz around her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will go back first." Chiz said: "What do you like about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Is she your sister?" The man who invited the dance said: "Her face is very bad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, it doesn't matter," the waitress hurried Say: "She just loves to have a little temper."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
