			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha Hopkins did not feel that the net that hangs over him is tightening in unison, even though he was once called the Messiah, he also Like all ordinary humans, thinking that such a day will continue (at least for a while) - in his thoughts, he has three years of comprehensive liberal arts and science courses and four years of medical school courses, and at least five to eight Year of clinical internship training, with the help of Besib. Bissand, he may become an attending doctor before the age of 30, he has decided to work with his father. Besib originally thought that he would go to the law. In Masoeri, only the "legal counsel" could become a confidant of his surname, but Sasha wanted to be a psychiatrist and a doctor of psychopathology. If it was not possible to put it 20 years ago, the people of Poseidon could not use the psychiatrist. They had alcohol, guns and women, but now, when Masoyer is gradually moving towards a legitimate business, It is important to have a key person who can be connected to the upper class in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Sasha Hopkins promised that he would marry a daughter of a Poseidon Islander and do a connection with Besib. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their children will grow up in a tolerant, affluent, sunny environment, carefree little sisters, they are free Stupidly alive, thinking that murder, robbery, rape and fraud are just a piece of news in newspapers and on television. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe they will be surprised at why their father and grandfather are so good at using guns and knives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking like this, Besib. Bissand smiled heartily. He sat next to Sasha, using only the mineral water in the bottle. Rinse your hair. His hair is black, thick, and with a roll, and after being wet, it has a metallic texture, like a circle of titanium steel balls - compared. His friend's hair is much softer, and Sasha began to accumulate in the last year of Grande. Now his hair can touch his earlobe, the wind blows over the court, picks up his hair, and the golden water waves in the sun. Flowing down. It’s so beautiful, people want to touch it when they look at it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not insist on his brother Besib, he did not hesitate to take off his gloves, touched the hair of Sasha, he thought he I will touch a soft kitten. The real feeling is like touching a big cat - leopard or tiger. The hair on the body looks soft. In fact, it is pointed, harder than expected, and a bit hot by the sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(This, written here, suddenly remembered "touching the dog's head but laughing"... If there is an adult who is out of this sentence, sorry.)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besib of the dog's head opened his mouth. Manchester in February has been raining for several days, and it is really pleasant to be able to get in touch with your brother on such a sunny day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, yes." He asked: "When?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" On Wednesday, "Sasha's micro-band blamed: "The same day you play." So he won't be able to see the game. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know that I am not sensitive to numbers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not sensitive to numbers. Question," said Sasha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib moved his face and pretended not to see, "Visit the day?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We may Need to go through the entire hospital," Sasha said: "We can see the application of some of the experimental results in practice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ears of the mice are transplanted to humans?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They did it 20 years ago," Sasha said. "I think, maybe There is something related to cloning medicine - I have read a piece of information. But I can't tell you that this information needs to be signed by a confidentiality agreement."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Therefore, you can get permission to visit..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"DuPont, Lor, Daly, Douglas, Carson." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishb whistled: "It sounds more like a political or financial internship."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Nothing compares The life is more expensive. "Sasha said. As he stood up from his seat, Besib's hand slipped from the top of his head. Falling on the back of the plastic seat, "especially when they can save more and more lives."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brian Dupont is not actually visiting. To be precise, he is one of the people responsible for “don’t make an accident”. There is nothing wrong with Sibu. The people who can enter the lab to visit are carefully selected. The family behind them ensures that these children will not be like ordinary people for various reasons (such as inexplicable morality, religious belief or one Bottles of whiskey) and the public in front of the mouth, after all, some experiments in the Manchester Medical Institute experimental site has indeed approached the human bottom line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or there are some... minor problems that need to be solved, Boa Douglas and Chiz Carson, an obvious abusive Sasha Hope Kings, while the other enjoys every minute of getting along with Sasha Hopkins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The experimenter has a very common surname on the Western continent. Brian calls him Dr. Smith, a former student and current teacher in Manchester. , teach biochemistry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A morning of the visit is not good enough, in the eyes of the world, the mysterious Manchester Laboratory is well equipped, but its main structure and other medical experiments are basically There is no difference. Except for a few test areas that they can't see for a while, the large floors are divided into small squares. They are only filled with shelves of jars, jars and test tubes. The grid has its own projects, "boss", "manager" and experimenter. There are only one person in the grid. He is responsible for the above three positions. Some of the "bosses" are clinicians or professors in the college. Others are purely scientific. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small equipment is available in every laboratory, large equipment is shared, they are allowed to enter a pcr room, this laboratory is used to enlarge Increase the molecular weight of a particular DNA fragment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dna of unfertilized eggs of rhesus monkeys." Dr. Smith said: "We combine the somatic cells of rhesus monkeys with the unfertilized eggs from which the DNA is removed. The dna of somatic cells are used for the operation of fertilized eggs. These fertilized eggs grow into embryonic cells in the laboratory. We have Extracting stem cells from the embryos - stem cells can be used to treat diabetes and spinal cord lesions - before we extract a batch of stem cells, we consume nearly 150 eggs and put them on the monkeys. No problem, but on humans. ... The embryo is to be destroyed before it can get stem cells. It involves philosophical and political issues. But we all know that it is best to get stem cells from my cloned embryos, and that stem cells don't have to worry about rejection. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They saw the early embryos of rhesus monkeys in the next lab. If it can continue to divide, grow and live, then it will become the second "ontology" - the DNA without foreign sperm affects it, everything in it It all depends on the ontology. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a simple lunch, the location of the visit was moved to Manchester Hospital, where the first batch of volunteers lived on a floor that was not accessible to non-related persons. Patients receiving clonal stem cell therapy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Religious people and environmentalists hate the first realization of cloning medicine, a field that violates the laws of nature and involves “God,” but religious people are generally not right. Anyone who publishes this, and the environmentalists will take action, the protests from the previous days are originating from this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avery was also amazed when they saw Sasha. He sat at the bed of a middle-aged woman and held her hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha nodded to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Trace, virus," Dr. Smith said: "It can cause spinal cord lesions. Previously we could only use drugs or cell penetrating repair therapy. Now we have A better way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A plain-dressed young woman carrying a bag Entering the gates of Manchester Hospital, the people who had been in a hurry did not notice her. The receptionist in the reception hall asked her what she was saying. She said that she was visiting the patient. The registrar found the patient's name on the roster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where is the bathroom?" The woman asked, a little embarrassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The registrar pointed out the location of the bathroom, she hurriedly ran over with the bag, the bag was open, a large bouquet of champagne rose across the mouth . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman walked into the cubicle of the bathroom and threw the large bouquet of champagne roses into the trash can, pulling out a plastic bag, which was full of plastic bags. Nurse costumes, including shoes, as well as business cards, masks, she quickly changed the clothes on her body, and then lifted out the small box of the bag, which is often used by nurses to hold potions and injections. The dropped bag was stuffed into the water tank by her, so as not to alarm a nerve-sensitive security guard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
