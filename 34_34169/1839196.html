Into the cut golden thick skin, he repeatedly cut along the edges of the flesh and skin to loosen the connection between them, and soon, the small peel was completely taken down. The bright red flesh covered with a white inner membrane came out. The "Ghoul" skillfully and carefully peeled off the intima with the nails - the unwanted part was discarded in the peeled peel - he was removing The neuron film wrapped around the human brain is also dry. The latter is stacked in the removed skull: "People used it more for the fox hunting ritual after the 16th century. The first hunt for the fox can Get a piece of bloody meat, which will make them completely excited."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changalle smiled, pouted, with a poisonous scorn, "We keep the former tradition." He rubbed his fat fingers: "The little beasts have long teeth, so they should taste the freshest flesh and blood. They have to get used to this, so that they don't get confused when they get it. I’m doing something stupid to lose something.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins started the juicer, cut the grapefruit and lime in a transparent container The blue blade is tumbling, and the juicer’s snoring is not big. The room was extraordinarily loud, but it didn't cover up the voice of Chegal. "There is a good chance now, I will let Besib go, and you will let Sasha go."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, if that is the case." Hopkins poured the thick juice into the shaker, mixing about two ounces of Bailey rum and one ounce of blue orange. Liqueur, shaken evenly, "I don't think Sasha is needed anymore, just before...he did a good job."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cega Le surprised to grin: "The Madonna is on, I can't hear anything, you are a mysterious mixed ball!" His voice is obviously curious: "I can know how he did it." Does he use a knife or a pistol? Does he really open someone's stomach or chest? Or is the trigger pulled over his head? Is blood, brain and stomach juice sprayed on his face and hair? Is there a smell of smell? Is that guy awake or comatose? It is best to be awake, does he have a curse, or is it Prayer? When he exhaled his last breath, was he squeaking like a hen or like a big fart? Are you at the side of Sasha? Is he hurt? Does he understand what he is doing? ?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He knows what he is doing." Hopkins replied without change, and the evenly mixed liquid was poured into two large glass beer mugs. Add the chopped ice cubes and soda, sprinkled with shredded coca leaves. He looked at the light like the sun, and the contents of the glass were as fascinating as the high-quality emerald. He handed a cup to Chegal: "He looked at him until he died."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's really a shame," Chegal carefully Covering his own suspicions, there is no such thing as what he did not know about on the island of Poseidon, and Hopkins and his son have not left this step for three years: "I originally hoped that they could go through this together. "Tang"'s lips popped like a frog's tongue, wrapped around the edge of the glass, rolled into a flesh-colored straw, sucked up, and the green liquid in the cup fell down three-thirds. Two: "Wow, it's cool and cool. Hot - Dear, I like this taste... I think he can still participate in this action, for the poor Besib. Anthony, at that time, there was a friend to accompany. "It's a good thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sasha will be willing," Hopkins said. "But I can know what kind of thing?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course," Chegal nodded. This action will lead to a whole body tremor: "Even if you don't want to know, I have to tell you. As a father, you have the right to know all the developments and details - it is not new, it is on the last In the week, Mr. John Carson and his friends had some troubles on the east side of Poseidon Island – and they also had their faults. They shouldn’t be so rashly into other people’s territory. Now the people over there have buckled them. Ask the Kason family for one billion yuan..." He grinned. "A lot, really a lot. Well, the idiots first found the investigation bureau and found that they completely hired another gang." Idiot, okay, this is really a 'blind person with a blind person, falling into the ditch together', and the people they sent were completely annihilated. Twenty-four hours later, the federal express delivered a leg of John Carson, frozen. It’s like a squid.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cigalle helplessly spread his hand, “On the day before yesterday, his ex-wife cried and found me, This tricky thing is thrown over."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the island in the east not belonging to the Richards family?" Hopkins said: "I remember that he and his son-in-law built a cod liver oil pill factory on it. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where is the case," Besib said, he bent his fingers and took the leaves out of the cup to fill the mouth: "Richards’s The mountain ridges on both sides are filled with coca bush, they pick fresh leaves and make rough processed products, and the factory is responsible for refining into free salt bases, which is what people say is high purification, but it is not a profitable sale...but This is not a good thing. That thing is really good for making money, but it is because it is too profitable, so it is both eye-catching and annoying..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They should be very strict, and John Carson can never pass outside." Hopkins responded innocently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The devil knows what this is," said Chegal, if he pointed out: "In short, he was on the island and was discovered." , caught, and all the people floating on the nearby boat - fortunately my people are not there. In fact, they have sincerely persuaded John Carson, don't arbitrarily cross the one I set for him. The line, unfortunately, Mr. Carson did not listen to his advice, he sneaked himself and got on his family.” He looked at Hopkins: “He took his daughter.” Fat The piled up man narrowed his eyes and looked exactly the same as the squeaky porcupine: "He always took his daughter in those days. Just like the Jews were holding his money box." He shook his head: " This is really sad. If he is willing to leave his daughter on Poseidon Island, she is still safe now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well," Hopkins said: "What do the Carsons want to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Changaler raised the glass that had been cleaned up to him. "At first they thought it was quite simple. They thought that I was a king. With one order, I could get back all the names of Carson and No. The unlucky ones - but they are not circulating a word on the Western continent, 'Even the king, without the master's permission, arbitrarily broke into the courtier's home. The courtier also has the right to lift a knife and gun to chase him out' - I am not even a The king, the people of Poseidon Island respect me and call me "Tang." I am willing to listen to my opinion, but only because I am a fair and benevolent leader. "He made a gesture of going inside," Richard Zhai is the sea god island, and Carson belongs to the western continent. Even if I can, I can not meet the interests of my own people and meet the requirements of outsiders... They said that they only raised 400 million in a short time, and I have to recommend them. Go back and make up again... Otherwise, I have to wait for the funeral. Poor little Chiz, she is only fourteen years old, more delicate flower bones." He took a heavy breath, as if it was really regrettable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, the Kason family is not as iron-hearted as they thought." Hopkins naturally took the message: "You are already preparing for action." . . . If there is no money - do they agree to cooperate?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you think I have any reason to convince the gang of stupid shit? "Celegal regained a sip of a cool fruit cocktail: "They still know the choice. The Richards family can't bear the fat," he said from the nose: "The short-sighted guy."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, Hopkins said in his heart. Otherwise, they will not support Meyare Bissand, and after the failure of Meyare Bissance, they are still complaining and eager to move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So is this action?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Absolutely safe," Chegal Again and again, "We will use nerve gas and tear gas, and the staff is fully equipped. Besib and Sasha will wait until things are basically settled before going to the island. They are still children. Have this right."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's great," Hopkins said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qiz Carson is in an ridiculously horrible dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was tied in a big room alone, there was no furniture in the room, the floor was white with small tiles, mostly cracked, the broken place was black and greasy, part The floor was covered with blankets, and several girls were lying on top of the body/naked/naked/body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of them is about the size of Chiz, the buttocks and chest are small like a baby, with a matted black hair, thin wrists and ankles like Matchstick, the skin is sallow, the eyes are like blue glass beads embedded in the inferior doll's eyelids - in one hour, there are four men who wheel her, and she does not say anything during the whole process, the last man After leaving, she waited for her legs, and determined that no one was willing to come back to enjoy the fun, and then groped for a corner of the blanket, wrapped her buttocks, and fell asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She doesn’t have any appetite, bread and water are like stuffed into the throat, only the “distribution” twice a day can make her feel excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first Qiz didn’t know what it was because it looked like a fat cigar until she heard a word, they called it "rock ". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most horrible addictions that Chiz had been exposed to were probably only marijuana and mild hallucinogens, but she has been from teachers and guardians many times. I have heard the scientific name, official name and alias of this thing - they are again and again, this is something that must not be tried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
