This book is also read by Bishib, although he is elective. It is Spanish, but when Sasha studied and studied the language more deeply, he also compiled an easy-to-learn Latin introductory textbook. "Historical, many important literary works, historical documents, political declarations. They are all written in Latin," his golden-haired brother said: "Of course, they all have translated texts, but whether it is that kind of translation, it will inevitably bring the translator's own habits and styles, wanting to be immortal. It is best to read the thoughts and souls of the original authors. It is better to read them aloud - by the way, let me hear your pronunciation. Now, general pronunciation is allowed, but it is better to use church-style pronunciation, which is the standard. Pronunciation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sitting under the window S & P looked at Anthony Hopkins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reception room is not spacious, the furniture inside is naturally small and exquisite, the sofa is the kind of couple-like two-seat, that is, one person sits too Wide, two people sit too narrow, when Besib and Sasha occupy it, Besib must put his two legs side by side on the side of the handrail or coffee table, and that pair of slimy, sweet When the father and son sat together, it was like two knives folded together - Sasha Hopkins was like a two-year-old child in the arms of his father. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light that shines in their weeks can be taken care of by others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishb doesn’t know how long this situation will last, Sasha said, they feel that they have neglected each other before, Beep and Besib There is nothing to say, according to Hopkins's theory, about 90% of the fathers and sons on the island of Poseidon are non-humans who ignore humanity and are indifferent to the family - the remaining ten percent, not There is no son. There is no father. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others don’t mention it for the time being, 瞧瞧贝普, his son has only seen him five times so far, born once. Christmas twice, Easter twice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beppe admired Anthony Hopkins because he heard that Little Hopkins was brought by his father from the baby. He has been "working" outside and studying in Grande. He only went home for two or three days, but in these two or three days, the impression that "baby is a demon" is like the branding on the hips and hips. Deeply engraved in his brain - he peeed on the new friety shirt that Bepnew got, and when he ate together, he ate six meals during the day. Energeticly playing around, climbing, ah, screaming, jumping on Beppe's stomach, squatting Bep's gun (God knows how he did it!). When it was smashing on the carpet, it almost caused a fire. At night, Beppe wanted to keep warm with his little wife. The little demon shouted and cried for 30 seconds every hour - just enough for his mother to go from the bedroom. Going to the baby room, he did it three times, and Beppe decided to give up. He was blindfolded and ready to sleep for a while (the nap was all stirred up by the gun that almost went off the fire). A few minutes later, his wife came to him with a small mixed-ball with a pointed tail, because he kept calling "Dad" and he wanted to play with Bep at two o'clock in the morning! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beppe hit his little ass and he burst into tears. Bep’s wife cried and then the whole family gathered in his bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is really the worst Christmas, after Bep knows that there is Christmas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He returned to Grande and complained about the bitterness of Besib. When he saw the subtle face of Besib, he suddenly think. If Besib decides not to son, or even marry, then Chegal, Bisang and Pei Pei will not put themselves in the machine for rolling olive oil, and then mix the wine. Drink it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The child is still very interesting," he quickly rushed to make up: "soft, fat, cute, cute - his..." He said hardly, the little mischief, purely because of me, I was very troublesome and annoying when I was young..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib shrugged: “I have said that she has wanted to keep me in the freezing room of the refrigerator and freeze it like a frozen fish, thaw it three times a day, so that I can eat – or play in my stomach. Into the hydrogen, take the rope around my belly button, so that she can take me out for a walk, visit neighbors, pray, buy things, without worrying about my ruining her dishes, carpets, communication and sleep, He laughed: "My memory is very good, Beep."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bep look at the sky: "You can find a gentle personality, like a quiet girl." Child," he suggested. "If Sasha has a sister like him," he said: "That's it, boys have The big possibility is with the mother."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishb is very happy that Beppe can see Sasha as a part of Poseidon, but he has to remind Look at this young, depressed and violent father. "No less than five times, the doctor got the scorpion and the lion head monkey group to find his son. For this, he got a leeches to be the nanny of Sasha, I don't. I think that the baby who follows his temper will be a treasure."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recalling that, Bup moved the mat under his body, "So, it’s my turn." "Is it going?" He said, initially, as he thought, a car would hit him when Avery Famo stepped out of Grande, breaking his legs or spine, or several drugs. Driven addicts, madly licking his knife in the dark woods, not to die, but at least to lie in the hospital for several months. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Hopkins didn't want to do that - given the lessons of the St. Thomas Church Elementary School, Sasha was a student of St. Thomas, and he was a teacher. It was very similar to the current situation. He wanted to let Sasha It was safe to read the eighth grade, or the nineth to the twelfth grade, but first Anne Kent, then Kemira, they attracted and the "institution" made him have to give up the beauty of St. Thomas and the Anzhen The hut (unfortunately), even though he has now regained his innocent status, Anthony Hopkins does not want Grande to become the second St. Thomas - and, Avery Famo It’s not difficult to get rid of this little guy. It’s not difficult to get rid of this little guy, but it might make those eyes that are suddenly lost to transfer their goals to him, or Sasha, or Besib, which is not good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea and practice of "Ghoul" is. He called Cade Carson and gave him a seemingly reliable plan, which would cause the Cassson family to once again attack the Douglas family. Take their rights and remove the nails they nailed in the school board - he didn't tell Kaide Carson what he really wants to do, but he can guarantee that the sinners that the Grand School can finally launch There must be a surname in the law. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The results are hard to say, they are all happy, the Carson family got what they want, but Avery Famo’s parents got a big enough To save the evidence of the big boy, Anthony Hopkins managed to get a few photos, which could not be taken by outsiders, because several of them were both secret and sinister. Only those who are really familiar with Grande can find it – even Anthony Hopkins, who is good at building the whole world in the memory palace, needs to take photos to reverse the shooting position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this person a teacher, a teacher’s family member, or just a school staff member? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who is he targeting? Grande, Carson, Douglas. Is Hopkins simply out of compassion and justice? <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Avery. When Famo was driven out of Grande, his relationship with Grande was far away. Not long after, his parents would go bankrupt. They will be forced to stay away from the loved ones and friends who are familiar with them and move to more chaotic. In a more dangerous neighborhood, when it comes to street accidents or robbery in the woods, there will be no uneven voices and attention. Crime is a common occurrence. Only a dead person will take up a small strip on the entertainment version of a newspaper with a circulation of less than 100,000 copies. The black title, a dozen words, warns of self-discipline, and people who are rich in life are better off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one will associate him with Hopkins and Bissance again. But now there are individuals who have blocked the "Ghoul" plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether this is purely accidental or intentional, Anthony Hopkins will find this person, but now he has to ask Besib Comments: "What position does Avery Famo occupy in the team today?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Running," Besib replied, Beppe cast a look and gestured him to be a little bit safe: "I am now a quarterback."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about the original quarterback?" ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He is no longer a quarterback," Besib said. "But he is still the captain." The football team captain also saw him when he saw him. Something was uncomfortable, but he soon endured it. Besib used his toes to guess what kind of deal he had with the coach. The coach also made a deal with him. Besib no longer pursued Ai. Free, he can become a quarterback in the second semester of the tenth grade, not a substitute, in the eleventh grade, now that the captain graduates, he can immediately become the new captain - and now the captain, after he graduated Before, he was the captain of the football team. This did not prevent him from applying to the university. Moreover, a division ranked from the back to the future. The unremarkable team and a team with a "dark horse" won the division championship and even appeared in the national league. The captain of the team on the field is absolutely incomparable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Avery. Famo apologized to me and vowed to do everything he could to help me, and the team won the division title and in the national league Get a pretty good grade."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The members of the school committee don't care about the insults and threats of the Famo family?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The coach asked them to look at Avery's strength - he could compete with a Ford Mustang that was launched."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you mean by the wild horse called the 'muscle car'?" Beep said: "Now that this high-powered car is no longer produced! Madonna, what car do I have to find to hit him? Tank?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little Hopkins glanced at his father. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is he running?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
