			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Grand River is an unruly river with hundreds of miles of hurried sections. Neither humans are allowed to build bridges on them, nor are they allowed to build dams. Other places may seem milder, but they are also covered with undercurrents and whirlpools. Who can think of it will extend such a feminine when it is about to return to the sea? Arms - a group of exhausted monks who came here a few hundred years ago, following the guidance of God, they settled here, and in the next 50 years they built up with the fundraising and the spontaneous work of the residents. The monastery of the three main buildings, which was once destroyed by war, the monks left here and established new homes and beliefs elsewhere; but the residents did not forget it, and on a morning they came back with their hands and white The rock has been rebuilt here, but the monastery without monks is like a body without a mind and heart. "What should we do with this?" People are reluctant to let their hard work come to nothing. Fleeting years, and finally they decided, there will be a school. This is the simple heart, only the church and the monastery, the best use in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the earliest time, students and teachers drink and use water from this tributary that traverses the entire land. They are still built by the river. In addition to grinding bread for the teachers and students of the school, the small mill also serves the surrounding residents and collects a modest rent. A large part of the school’s maintenance and repair costs, student scholarships, have come from this. To this day, this tolerant and peaceful tributary has a new use. The Grand School swimming team is doing intensive training here. This is a unique new attempt. The resistance and static generated by the constantly changing rivers or Swimming pools with regular artificial waves are completely different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The school cleaned up about 300 feet of rivers, workers moved the reefs in the river, removed plants from the water and water, and set up wooden Starting block. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The suggestion was made by the swimming team coach Marcia and won the children’s welcome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Grand Boarding School has two indoor heated swimming pools. Built according to the international competition swimming pool standard, the long pool is 164 feet long, the short pool is half of the former, the starting platform, the buoy lane, the backstroke handshake, the black glazed brick lane marking line and the electric shock board timer Fully equipped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is undeniable that the dry air cleaned by the machine and the filter is not as humid as the scent of flowers and plants; the cold ice tiles are not compatible with Compared with the pebbles of the light pebbles; the light of the three primary color energy-saving fluorescent lamps can never be compared with the bright skylight; even if it is disinfected and purified by strong chlorine, ozone and ultraviolet rays every day, the water heated by the heat pump can certainly not be forever Flowing, compared to the clear water of the sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha and his new companion jumped into the warm river, and a group of silver squid swam out from under the wood platform, swimming alongside them, and the water was so clean. People and fish are like floating in the air, and the shadows float lightly under them and under them, in places where the shadows are not covered. The sunlight through the river melts into a flowing network of gold on the brown cobblestone bottom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha did not compete with others. First, he swam a short full distance (long round trip twice) as a warm-up, and then traveled two full journeys (round trip After four times, he stopped under the guidance of the coach, and the pale blond-haired boy came out of the water. Fingers grab the platform that is also made up of whole logs, and the drops of water hang from his eyelashes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As their name suggests, their coach Marcia is as strong and grim as a female warrior. She used to be a professional athlete who specializes in butterfly and freestyle. After leaving the club, Marcia still insisted on training for two hours a day. So her body is still as strong as the peak time – she has a wider, thicker shoulder than the average man, with a flat chest and almost the same width as the hips and waist. Abnormally strong, brown hair is cut very short, her face is hard to say is good or bad - thick eyebrows pressed against a pair of sharp amber eyes, high cheekbones, wide and flat mandible. The nose is as high as a bird's beak, and the lips are not full. There is something wrong, the teeth are white and neat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The noise in the swimming pool is very loud, and the ears filled with water will become more and more dull. You want others to hear what you say. Loud, the coach is especially good, so she developed a problem like yelling, and her voice is as loud and generous as a tenor, she is deafening, she simply tries not to talk on weekdays, so as not to be scared from time to time. Sometimes Sasha can't help but compare her to another memorable female teacher. If Kemira has the look and sound of Marcia, she doesn't have to spend so much effort to change her genes. - From the front and from the back, it is hard for people to believe that this is a woman, even if she often wears only a black, tight-fitting one-piece swimsuit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Masia squats down, this posture is very similar to the action that the weightlifter did before the squat, the whale-like back is bent, the muscles of the thigh and calf Inflated, her feet are wide, her toes are large, she is holding the wood, her heels are hanging, her hands are loosely folded over her thighs. This movement is usually difficult, she does it effortlessly and can stay long. time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, hey," she tried her best to keep her voice down, but Sasha still sounded like a thunder that was approaching the sea on the other side of the summer at dusk: "How do you feel, and have strength?" She said quickly: "If you can, how about a short full-length butterfly stroke?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha lazily yawned, like a cat Then push the shoulders backwards. Of course, no cat can be as good at him and like water. Little Hopkins likes water, whether in the sea, in the lake, in the river or even in the pool, aiming at a target. Before going, the body or the body is swung into the water, waving the arm, flapping the soles of the feet, lifting the head from the water, the water flowing over the cheeks, the air flowing through the tongue, whatever it is, can make his spirits cheer up with the exhaustion of the body. - He bent his mouth and revealed a flattering smile: "Okay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you have to do your best," Miss Marcia narrowed her eyes. The wrinkles in her eyes immediately became dense: "Let me see how fast you are." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha understood her meaning when she returned to the starting block. There were only two people on the starting stage, Hopkins and another boy, Boa. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boa was the official member of the swimming team two years ago. It was the "Heavy Play" and won several awards for the school. He is as good at butterfly and as Miss Marcia. Freestyle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha and Boa are standing next to each other, Miss Marcia orders. The boy's body stretched into a beautifully shaped bow in the sun. Two fascinating big fish broke into the water at the same time. Marcia waited for them on the platform opposite the starting block. Her legs were separated and the arms were supported. With the knees, I was concentrating on searching for small details that made her stretch or frown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boa is the same age as Sasha, but he is faster than Sasha, although not many, he first touched the wall, turned, and Sasha followed him Rear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the second half, Sasha almost caught up with Boa. When he reached the finish line, Boa’s body suddenly tilted to the left and his arm hit. Under Sasha's ribs, Sasha did not let this force work on himself, but he sank down. The shadow cast by Boa passed over the pebble beach in front, and Sasha controlled the body and floated. Out of the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The advantage of Boa became very obvious, the coach Marcia picked up her arm, and she waited until both of them reached the end point and spoke, first Boa "Boa, dear," her plain tone suggests that this is just the beginning of a sentence, or a mantra rather than a sincere intention: "I am sorry, you made a mistake, a big mistake, a very big mistake, you The final grade will be deducted by one point," she said. "Apologize, in addition, not the next time." Boa did not speak, Marcia's lips tightened, like a wire: "Tell me, no. Next time. Otherwise leave."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
