			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Masia suddenly opened Boa, her strength is great, not only pushes the boy a long way, but also makes himself wimpy Falling to the ground, rubbing the skin on the elbow - she has no feelings about it - the boy floats on the water, silent, watching the woman who is almost three times his age is like the first time The little girl who realized the difference between men and women was panicked and wiped her lips with her back and fingers again and again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...What the hell are you thinking about?" Marcia tried to calm down, it was hard, her lips kept on, shoulders The stiffness is like a rock. The sticky feeling left by Boa's tongue is still lingering in her mouth. The saliva in the remaining saliva has the taste of milk. She resisted the disgusting feeling. "Are you drinking?" "Drinking a bit of white wine at dinner, and drinking a glass of champagne after the meal, the two will not produce the aftertaste that should only be found in a single malt whisky." Like tobacco, it is like peat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thick spices and cream, chocolate, plus whiskey and fine spirits, should be about 17% alcohol in the Baileys . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no cigarettes and wines in Grandley’s shops and vending machines, but seniors can manage to get all kinds of contraband from the outside. The secret, as long as you don't make any big things, teachers and administrators will close their eyes, anyway, for those children who used to live in honey before, suddenly hit the front The reality is that bitterness and sorrow - the things they want to meet and bear are heavy like the Bronte Peak of Black Iron - but if they don't want to live up to the expectations of their parents, friends, and even the community, and want to apply A more famous university, in order to get a decent job in the future, you must immediately wake up from a leisurely dream of more than ten years, and put your own gpa on your own (the average score of each year in high school). ), sat1 (university exam scores), sat2 (specialty test scores) and ap (university exam scores) these four will automatically tighten the noose. Both hands are hand-in-hand, never let go - the resulting pressure is enough to put the child into a labyrinth of headache, fatigue, ulcers, stomach disorders and insomnia, even with some more serious neurological disorders, heart rhythms Accelerate diseases such as cardiovascular disease. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are always people who use drugs, alcohol and cigarettes to relieve stress during the exam, which is quickly becoming an unspeakable tradition - some students before and after the game It will do the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Marcia felt that she had found the reason and her heart calmed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boa swim back, he was pushed away by Marcia, and the whole person briefly sank into the water under the influence of external force, on his face Full of crystal clear water marks, in the moonlight. He is like an ivory dancing little doll placed in a silver music box with innumerable jewels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought you liked me," he said gently. Sadly said: "I thought... Marcia, in your heart, I am different." He looked up and stared at Marcia: "I like you, Marcia. I love you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a time, the two did not make any more noise. In the swimming pool, only the wind slammed through the crevices and the sound of the pool wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I also...like you," After a while, Marcia said: "You are a beautiful, talented child. I Looking at you, I often think, if I have children, it must be like you." She said: "I am very happy that you like me - but Boa, you are still confused, you do not know What are you doing - don't interrupt me, now I am clear-headed, and you drink alcohol... Or do you just want to tease me? (Boa shakes his head immediately). Or you treat me as Others? (shakes faster)...” Marcia paused, and Boa waited: “I believe in you. Boa,” she said slowly, with a soft voice that was hard to imagine appearing on her, ignoring The boy is filled with eyes of pleading and hope: "You are not a real bad boy... So, Boa (she swallowed) I will forget about it, thorough, complete. You have not been here, I have never seen me, nothing can happen - just like this." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hate the exam," Besib said: "If it exists It is inevitable, then who can tell me why it is not scored day by day, I feel that I have been cut by zero."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Things that have happened will make you look like a sly old woman," Sasha walked out of the bathroom, dressed in clean and shirt, linen trousers, and wiped her wet hair with a large jewel-colored bath towel: " If they are all placed in a day, you will feel that it is like being beaten by a man, punching your right fist and stunned, and you can't even breathe." He dropped the bath towel. Looking at the mirror hanging on the wall, he didn't have time to cut his hair for the past two weeks. The bangs were long and covered his eyes. He found a plate of coral red and oyster white from the pocket of his bag. The fine hair clips, push the bangs back by hand, and then fix them with hair clips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How come you have this?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Souvenirs from visiting the community," Sasha said: "You still remember what I said to you before the exam." "Our new society? Uh huh?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remember clearly," Besib said sloppily: "Even during the exam, I am I want to find another place for four or five hours - I might be able to sleep while training, but I don't have to look too carefully at that time." He grabbed the hem of the shirt and put it directly like a vest. It took it off the head and walked into the bathroom. The faucet above the bathtub was slamming the water, and the mist was transpiration - Besib tried it, it was his favorite temperature - slightly high, able to keep hot from the skin. Into the internal organs and bones - he straightens up, for a minute or two, forgets what he should do next, he wraps around the bathroom for half a turn, unscrews the lid of the styling gel, and squeezes out the translucent milk inside Cream, rubbed the entire chest - when found Could not help but whispered curse up, one leg jumping took off their remaining clothes, hurriedly fled into the bathtub. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water just can't pass his knees, the white cylinder wall, the dark brown limbs are like painted on it, Besib hangs his head, with his hands Picking up hot water on his face, he was finally awake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You just said to visit the community?" When waiting for the hot water to drown all of them, Besib asked loudly: "How is it?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not bad." Sasha also raised his voice and replied that a comfortable couch-style recliner was moved by Besib next to the floor-to-ceiling window leading to the small balcony. It is lined with a thick latex sponge, the surface is full calfskin, dark brown, with a hint of leather - possible between training and tutoring, during a very short break, Besib I will sleep on it for a while, now it is owned by Sasha Hopkins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a loud sound of water and a vague shout in the bathroom. Fortunately, the Hopkins hearings were very good. "I think so, but Besib," he said. "I don't think you will fit this club - its full name is 'drama, props and make-up'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The side of the sand listened, and there was a big splash in the bathroom. Something fell on the floor tiles. The sound was crisp. It should not be the human body... Not just, Little Hopkins shrugged his shoulders - the floor-to-ceiling windows were open. The scent of gardenia rushed into the room with the strong wind of the wind, and Sasha took out a thin blanket from the room. He is more suitable for this recliner than Besib. His height is just right. I don’t have to hang two feet like Besib. He pulled up the blanket until it was below the chest, then crossed his hands on the abdomen, closed his eyes, and slept comfortably—the posture was exactly the same as his father who used to be in a mental hospital and a prison cot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Hopkins was sleeping between a shallow sleep and a deep sleep, the door to the room was opened, and the third person with the room key came in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avery saw Sasha sleeping by the floor-to-ceiling window at a glance, he hesitated and wanted to wake Hopkins - his courage accumulated It takes a long time and it is amazingly fast to consume. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unbearable guilt and shame have afflicted this ordinary boy for a long time, he can't sleep well, his stomach is not good, he is stupid all day long. The coach has already reprimanded him many times - for those who should not make mistakes, his test scores can be imagined, and he does not have to wait for the results to come out. He also knows that it must be a mess... He thought for a long time, still decided And Besib, and Sasha apologize, in addition, there are instructions - he is not intentional, at least, he does not know what the old players are doing privately, he does not know that they will change the location of the prank, but also exchange In such a dangerous place... He knows nothing, thinking that this is just a harmless joke, a small hone that every new player has to accept, a good opportunity to show courage and courage, endurance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib. Bissand and Sasha Hopkins didn’t say anything, just hit him with a punch, a heavy fist, he fell A tooth, swollen face is like a rugby into the mouth - after they have not found Avery's trouble, they do not care ...<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They turned him out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Avery can't tell the uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood in front of Hopkins, but found himself has nothing to say - those who are ready, self-feeling, emotional words In the face of the facts, pale and fragile can not match a piece of paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't have to say anything," Sasha suddenly opened his mouth, he still closed his eyes, Avery shuddered. "Whatever, we I am not interested in listening - Avery, I am a timid person with Besib, very timid, where we have been hurt, we will go far, never pass again - now I There is only one request."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sasha..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Walk away, you block The wind is coming."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
