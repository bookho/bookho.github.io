			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Celegal. More than a few people from Santander, a real estate agent with a good record of ten years, a seasoned lawyer, a smooth and sensitive Public relations consultant, an emergency contact, two assistants, they are all Poseidon people, or sisters or daughters who married the Poseidon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two assistants are carrying the Beretta 380 automatic gun, which can hold 11 bullets. They live in the house in the town of Grande. In the case, Amp is very familiar with them. They respected Besib and liked Sasha Hopkins who stood beside Besib. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They think you are a smart person." Besib said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little Hopkins is doing his homework as a homework with ppt and spreadsheets, column charts and graphs. This simple and easy-to-understand way is much better than the files that are piled up with dazzling numbers, names, and professional words. You know, although there are middle schools and universities in Poseidon, you can count that. Is the school that is able to graduate from a mentally handicapped pig to provide its students with the necessary education? The people of Poseidon have their own set of beliefs. They either learn from their fathers, brothers, or in prison. 20 years ago, people can still, but twenty years later, they are focusing on the economy. The Poseidon Island who moved to the legal business had to face the trouble caused by the previous negligence. Indeed, they can hire college students, graduate students, doctors, but they will never be able to gain the trust of the people of Poseidon. After a few years of courageous cooperation, those poor employees did not have an accident, or they were sent to the dock. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Hopkins accepted a lot of half-truthful compliments and compliments,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Shit!" Chegal told him: "The reason why they are full of sweet words is because the lawyers found new ideas in the report, they re-drawn the contract, and the profits of Poseidon Island increased by two. Percentage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Abby will be thundering."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take him." Galleman didn't care to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Abby is thunderous," the lawyer said. "He refused to put our people in his gym."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Impossible," Besib said "Tell him. I am having a headache for the unemployment rate. We have made restaurants, factories, farms and laundry rooms. The people working in it are all federal citizens. If they can't solve their work for them, the future will become very good. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This I have told him," said the lawyer, who unbuttoned the suit before he sat down. He took a policeman. With a holster, the handle of the pistol is close to his rib: "Before we took away 2% of his annual profit, he wanted to retaliate, or talk to us about the price."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Abby’s attitude is very strange," Sasha said, taking out a bottle of pale pink fresh wine, a big Hopkins mail order. Everyone present was given a cup: "If he is really dissatisfied with the contract, he should not sign it before."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have an informant He worked in the restaurant. He called me half an hour ago and saw that Abby had two strangers to dine and had a lot of hard alcohol. A person had a thorn wreath on his forehead. There were also tattoos under his eyes. There are also on the fingers," said Amp, sitting next to him as an assistant or more correct, the mob, he was very young, his face was red and black. The cheekbones are very tall, the squats are square, the body is strong, and there is no joke, just like a frozen steak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Northerner," the emergency contact said with disgust: "Abby is walking a tightrope. He contacted the Cloven family himself and then contacted us through Judah. I want to use this slick, he wants to use the Cloven family to press us, and the Crowe family has crossed the line. He will come to our ass."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Let's check out the two northern people," Besib said. "Look at the newcomer or the old man." He put the empty cup on the small marble coffee table: "It's new." , let them disappear "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; *** <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; the rain poured down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now in January, the temperature in Grande is maintained at around five degrees Celsius, wet, cold, and the streets are crowded, and Sasha and Besib sit in one In the black Chevrolet, this is Pepi's second car. He likes lm008, but the car is too conspicuous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The chef and owner of this restaurant is from the north.” Amp sat in the passenger seat and looked out. The sudden rain gave the window a thick film. He could only see a fuzzy outline. There is also a milky white halo, although it is daytime, but the sky is faint, and it is necessary to turn on the lights indoors: "Every family eats various meals, old rules." Most of the people of Poseidon Island will be opened to the people of Poseidon. Dining in the restaurant, safe, and delicious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do the people of the Cloven family come every day?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are very cautious," Amp licked his thick lips: "Abby arranged them in a high-class apartment. There were surveillance probes everywhere, and they were equipped with two bodyguards. They were the boxers in his gym. They themselves With people, only one often comes, time is uncertain, one or two people will be around each time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The two people follow?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Follow, and they never eat in the hall," Amp said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How far is it from their home to here?" Sasha asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Four miles."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So they will not be happy to come over." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They always drive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have an idea," Sasha said: " Maybe you can try it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked Amp to call his informant and ask the newcomer to the Cloven family to eat several times. Something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leif smelled a taste that made him feel hungry immediately— - It is the smell of rich red soup. The good beef is chopped and boiled. The boiled meat is rotten. The soup is thick, and the cabbage, beets, potatoes, carrots, onions, tomatoes, and finally a large piece of butter are placed. Sit directly on the table in the pot, topped with a little foamy sour cream and dill cilantro, served with hot bread sprinkled with salt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat up from the bed, he looked for the past, opened the window, the rain was still down, just a little bit, the fragrance became thicker, he wanted to find its source, I only saw the black forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's time for dinner," he said to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked his companion, his companion was more willing to drink some wine in the room, and Lev promised to bring him a dinner to come back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leif left with two people, one is Abby’s boxer and the other is his own. They went straight down to the garage and a dark gray Bugatti drove out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three blocks between them and the restaurant. At the second street, they were stopped by a police car, wearing a black waterproof police uniform. I leaned over and looked at the people inside the car and showed my own documents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's the matter!?" Lev shouted impatiently, feeling that he was almost hungry to eat his stomach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The driver who acted as a driver clenched his head awkwardly: "They asked us to get off, sir, a vicious case, everyone should be examined."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leif looked at the car in a malicious manner. Twenty years ago, he could pull out his gun and put him in the head to bloom. Unfortunately, it was so good. The scene can no longer be seen, whether it is the north or the south, it is a coward who is lingering under the harsh state machine of the Federation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even with a waterproof hood, the turmeric hair is still wet, except for them, there is a bad luck being checked, his car It was a worthless old Ford, and the other was taking the documents from him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police car parked at the door of a cafe, the lights of the police car were closed, the cafe closed, the umbrellas were confiscated, and the rain wet the back of Lev He and his head, he took his own person to the nearest umbrella, the boxer looked at his head and went to another umbrella to wait. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inspection over there was over, and the bad luck walked over here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they got to the boxer, they pulled out the gun from the clothes, the boxer saw it, he wanted to yell, the bad luck bullet penetrated him. forehead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lev’s hand was still in his pocket, the turmeric hair opened a folding knife in his hand, and the folding knife went in from his jaw, to the right Crosscutting, cut his right carotid artery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His bodyguard almost died at the same time as him, and the other shot a shot on the back of his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the silencer is very light, no more than the sound of rain hitting the awning, the blood is washed into the sewage well, Lev and the other two The body of the individual was moved to Bugatti. The turmeric hair sat in the driver's seat, and the three cars quickly disappeared into the rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a car repair shop in Chegal, Bisangdi, The workers were busy stripping the police car signs on the black Chevrolet. They were all temporarily printed and then pasted. The two young men took off their police uniforms and the documents were handed to the little Hopkins waiting aside. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How come you have this thing?" Pepi picked up a document and flipped it over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My own work, the props of the drama club." Sasha said, using a sponge to put on the cleansing oil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why is the police uniform?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mob took the wig of turmeric and wiped his face. He now looks like a Poseidon Islander. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is another one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Amp to take care of him." Besib Said: "The guy has to deal with a lot." A homosexual who hides in order to avoid being ridiculed by his accomplices, they let a beautiful man hook up on him two days earlier. When Leif went out, he immediately followed him. Slid out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishb gave the emergency contact a note with the name and address. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are still these." He said softly: "Take people to kill them, don't wear eyes, don't ear, hands, or feet, don't move Deadly place."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are these people?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Abby The old bastard's five favorite boxers," Besib said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
