The girl and the boy’s house were dismantled, and the things inside were thrown out. The old woman saw a rich reindeer fur, which she gave to the girl—the girl was a good man, beautiful and diligent, from Don't steal chickens and touch dogs, and make troubles. She rarely came, but the little nest was always clean and bright. She also planted ginger, garlic and carrots in the backyard like all the women of the yupik (aboriginal self-proclaimed). She brought the old woman a The charcoal-heating stove can be held in the hand, the silver one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If she is a single Yuppi girl, the old woman will try to match her and her grandson, but she is not, and she has a companion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old woman looked at the two curled bodies that were carried into the car. Well, she said in her heart that she could not sleep with the people she liked. That is also a blessing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stewed lamb," said her grandson, carrying a heavy, powerful fire rifle in his hand, "cheese burritos."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," said the old woman. "We have to eat horse meat. Don't complain. Who told you to kill the horse without discussing it with me? Enza and the festival have passed. My relatives and friends have returned home. Who do you want to eat these meats? And now it is not the season of slaughtering, we can't find the enema master, so much meat, we have to eat this winter," she said He said: "When you do, eat horse meat, stew horse meat, add some garlic and onions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Youpick’s young people caught Face, the little flying insect turned around his arm and hand: "This is also a vain thing," he said. "It broke the hoof, it didn't live. - I have to go back when I go back." Buy a horse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is your own fault." The old woman said, "What crazy have you made, come back to see me at this time? Old not If it is not 'bear paws' just passing there, you alone. Can you come to me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why not," her grandson Said: "I am a lucky guy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hangs the rifle back to the wall, lifts the hatchet that is placed next to the fireplace, and walks into the kitchen. As we said before, the people of Orlosa don't need a refrigerator and a cellar. There is a flat door on the kitchen floor, just below the table, covered with a thin handwork. Carpet, he opened them and drilled down - this pile is higher than other Yuppik families. When the old woman’s father-in-law, husband and son are still alive, they will also freeze below. The layer was hollowed out by a foot. So the young man only needs to bow down slightly and walk around smoothly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horse has been peeled off, cut down four legs, one leg as a reward for the people who helped slaughter, they ate the second leg these days . There are also two legs, and a large, red and white body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He mentioned that the axe had cut about two pounds of meat on the horse's leg. On top of his head, the old woman had already put a whole pot of water and cut it. Ok, the onions, peeled off the garlic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horse meat produces a lot of foam and odor during the cooking process. But after putting in onions and garlic, and the old lady's secret spice bag, the scent of the stunned scent disappeared slowly, replaced by a strange sour taste, cut into quarters. A large palm meat is shrunk in the sauce red soup, only the fingernails are large, and the old woman adds carrots and parsley. The peppers are all pulled from their own yard and are very fresh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to compensate, the old woman made a lot of cheese burritos, and the crust was made early. They are tied together, closely resembling the lines of a circle that are common on bolts. The old woman throws a piece of grease on the pan, and spreads the cake without waiting for them to melt, in an age with her. At a disproportionate rate, sprinkle the chopped cheese (cheese with milk and cheese with mare's milk) on it, then spray the ant-like black pepper, which is very hot, and the cake has a pungent oily aroma. The soundy, loose-skinned fingers quickly squeezed the side of the crust and rolled it into a roll. The heat of the burritos and oil melted the cheese in the crust, the cake was placed on a plate, and honey and sour cream were poured. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being so lining, even the sour taste, the tenacious horse meat has become delicious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old woman’s appetite is as good as her grandson, although one looks like a big apple still hanging on the branch, and the other is like being thrown On the side of the road, the wind dried up for a long time. She couldn't bite the horse meat, and after she dipped the juice, she swallowed the small pieces of hard meat. Her stomach was much more than her teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After eating, the old woman went back to the room to sleep, the young man was responsible for the rest of the work, he collected and cleaned the bowls, plates, spoons and forks in the dimly lit kitchen, put them in their original position, and lifted them up. When I want to put the horse meat in the cupboard, when I want to put it in the cupboard, the carpet that he stepped on under his feet is like a devil’s life, and his body slides back uncontrollably. His hand tried to catch the side of the wall cabinet but failed. Every place was greasy, his head hit the corner of the table, and a large group of indigenous people rang the gongs and sheepskin in his mind. Drums, black fog drifting in his field of vision, the ground is shaking, he knows that he fell to the ground, his fingers caught the foot of the chair, when he wants to get up, one The arm was around his neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before he grabbed the arm, it flashed away, replaced by a metal wire that trembled deep into the flesh and cut it. It's so deep, like cutting it with a knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For anyone who doesn’t know the truth, Father Peter is like a good old man, short, slightly fat, ruddy, smooth, only eye-tailed There are very small wrinkles, the corners of the mouth are a little funny, and there is a St. Paul-style hairstyle that we can often see on the head of the clergy. The black collar of the shirt reveals a white collar, and the body is filled with the smell of agarwood and myrrh. . His hands habitually, humbly clasped each other, placed in front of the abdomen, the cuffs are loose, so that he can reach into the cuff at any time, and pull out the special alloy crown from the side of the watch - crown Connected to a piano line, its principle is similar to our commonly used telescopic headphones and network cable, only about three feet, but if it just wants to hold a man's neck, no matter how much his sternocleidomast muscle is developed. It is enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even now, his eyes are still kind and compassionate, not like taking away a person’s life, as if giving him a new life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pair of fingers slender hands removed the chair. Removed the table, lest the victim violently kicked the old woman who was sleeping in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fr. Peter rarely seldom "work", but that doesn't mean he will be the last to a murderer, as if he could be with a giant The strength of the struggle and the ugliness are distorted to the face that is comparable to the devil. He sat on the floor of the kitchen, and his feet were like the medieval executioners who stepped on the shoulders of young people as they were hanged. The body formed an acute angle with the ground, and the hands were tight around the metal noose, tightening his prey. Tight; he calmly counted seconds in his heart, sixty seconds. This sturdy young man, he will turn his eyes, spit out the purple tongue, the mouth is full of white foam, his feet can be kicked vigorously; one hundred seconds. His movements slowed down, slower, and the coughing sound in his throat would be lighter, and his tongue would be softer; two hundred seconds. He would lick with a slight twitch, his legs trembled, his toes and fingers stretched out; two hundred and fifty seconds, or three hundred seconds. You can smell the smell of urine and the smell of cockroaches, just like the horse meat that has not been added to the spice. This is a smell that can't be forgotten anyway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he counted one hundred and sixty, the thin metal rope on his finger suddenly loosened, and the priest’s reaction was fast enough—the hand in the crown was forced to slam, and the noose was tightened again— But what he saw was incredible. One hundred and sixty seconds ago, he was still a strong young man with a height of six feet. After one hundred and sixty seconds, he was a real girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl’s neck is much thinner than the young man, so just a moment, she stretched a finger between the noose and her neck. But her vocal cords were still pressed. She couldn't speak, so the second change appeared. "She" melted and formed again. In five or sixty seconds, she changed from a girl. A little boy who is only ** years old, can hold a small neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He may have put a pair of small hands in it, the little boy hurriedly took a deep breath, using the sharp voice inherent in the child. (Actually, it is almost inaudible) He called: "Don't kill me!" He cried, "I am Mrs. Crovin's man!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The noose was relaxed at once, but it was still around his neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mrs. Crowe let you go to steal the diamonds of the Cloven family?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The little boy was surprised. He didn't talk, his eyes were like a big man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are still distinct, thin and pale hands, they are carrying a large leather bag, which is often seen on the shoulders of the Yuppiks. The leather bag, with two belts, one long and one short, can be slanted back or one shoulder, the big one can put the little boy sitting on the kitchen floor directly, its body is covered with bloody Crushed ice, because it was originally stuffed in the belly of a dead horse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hands open the leather bag and take out the same thing from the inside. Konstantin once showed it to Dr. Hopkins and nailed it to the black velvet display board. Diamonds, diamond-set suits, and others, large diamonds, diamond rings, diamond bracelets, diamond necklaces... and excellent diamond blanks in a black sheepskin bag. Diamonds that have been machined or simply cut, or only partially polished, are piled up in piles like the most common glass pebbles. They are best shots. The cut diamonds are not recognized without any coding. The real origin is just that the value is hard to estimate - but in view of this, the total value should be more than 150 million yuan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
