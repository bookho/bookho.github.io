			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think," Chegarard sat at his favorite table and stuffed a piece of pure wheat bread soaked in olive oil into his mouth. The olive tree swayed the leaves, the sun shone from the gaps that were constantly changing and swayed, and cast it on his broad face. The face became variegated and looked like a mosaic of the Greek era: "You can't always This goes on." He said to you, this is not because of politeness or other reasons, just to show closeness and aggravating tone. In the past, he would say to his brother, so to Meyare, to Toto. Said, but few people are worthy of doing it now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins blinked, like his son, he was doing this with a bit of real innocence and childishness. He cast a look of encouragement and enquiry to Chegal, and at the same time picked up a glass of white wine with honey and ice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I mean you and Sasha." Chegal nodded to the old Andriana, she was bringing a new dish - a Using a rosemary and local liqueur (made with nectarine) as a seasoning, the small suckling pig slowly cooked on the charcoal fire, the color is red, the skin is crispy and tender, and the arugula is added next to it. "Do you really want him to stay here for a lifetime? No, no, I am not expelling you, you know, my dear Hopkins, you and Sasha are a good gift from the Virgin and others. Gifts, but I still have to say that Poseidon is a good place to live and work, but not very suitable for young people, they need to go out, see insights, look at the big scene..." His fingers moved over the roast suckling pigs Remove, not sure which one to come first. "The left side is better." Hopkins made a suggestion, and Chegal was pleased with his life. The thick fingers instead of the forks pierced the golden red pig skin. "Hey! Good guy," Chegal said. It’s really hot.” ​​Having said that, he didn’t show any pain or hesitation at all. The pig’s left leg was torn down, lifted to the front of the mouth like a torch, and the white teeth were closed. The bones were bitten and squeaked: "Bishb and Sasha are big enough," said the god of the sea god, "Tang" said that he thoughtfully flipped the remaining flesh and made it like a branch. The pencil or the coin is rolling like a bone: "Look, there are four things you can never recover, the words that are said, the bullets that are fired, the chances of missing, the time of disappearing..." Chegal paused for a while, The remaining pig legs were thrown into the plate: "They have to go to college in a few years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hei Shendao has a university," Hopkins Said: "There are computers, libraries, and laboratories, and teachers will also . "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;"No," Chegarah shook his head. "They may have been really good teachers, but now they are almost scared. They are used to putting a good score on the students' test papers, even if they are Maybe I just wrote the first poaching poem... We are sometimes a bit rude - I hope that Besib and other children can attend a better school, like Stanford or Princeton, and be eager to learn. Point to the real bullets, cut the real good things. Where did you read the book? Anthony, Harvard Medical School?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who knows. I have been there. Too many places, Haval, Karolinska, St. Louis, Michigan, Duke...and John Hopkins, look, and my surname," Hopkins casually replied: "唔嗯嗯..." He raised a hand and made a wave-shaped posture in the air: "regenerative medicine, pathophysiology, immunology, pathogenic biology, neurosurgery, anesthesiology, pharmacology, etc. I always walk around, where? Look at it, stop here, sometimes I will go to the spice and music appreciation class, the classical poetry class, the cooking class is also very good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cut Galle stared at him for a moment: "Too strong curiosity, lost Eden," he muttered and said a familiar proverb: "Well, let your little secret stay safely in yours." In the belly - but I still have to throw Besib on the mainland."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins raises the glass and observes the cut behind the transparent glass Le, the golden ochre liquid swayed slightly. The flat and fat face of "Tang" is no different from the roast suckling pig he is enjoying. The fat accumulates under the skin, the skin is shiny and shiny, and the hair is thick, like an animal's cockroach. Mao, his chest pulled down, and together with the fat of the abdomen, fell below the groin. His arms and legs were twice as thick as before the tragedy. The whole person looked like a pile of melted butter. , can be rare, people who can get the trust of this "good guy" know, Chegal The body has not become weak and dull because of this excess of oil, which can be easily degraded. In the blink of an eye, he can easily throw an unpleasant bastard from the head of the room to the end of the room. He took a short-handled rifle and made a rotten hole in the head of the idiot sitting opposite him, or directly used a fist and a knee to make you a thin face with lightning speed. Pie... Compared to other people, Hopkins knows that there are more points. For example, he might also roll the thin cake and put it directly into his mouth to eat it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mutator is stronger, more acute, and more tenacious than the average person. Hopkins licks his lips, how long does Chegal live? Twenty years, fifty years, one hundred years? Will he still have children? This is almost inevitable. With his living in the same house and occasionally acting as his personal doctor and pharmacist, Hopkins knows that Chegal's sexuality/desire does not vary with age and weight. The growth is reduced, the sperm/sub is a bit thin, but it is quite active. As long as Chegal is willing, he can have a dozen children. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Besib, this is not very good, especially if he has to stay outside for several years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My previous advice was related to it," Chegal took back the pig leg that was previously thrown on the plate. He had a good appetite and was very Cherish food, never waste: "On the mainland, I have some loyal and reliable friends, they will take care of Besib for me, but no matter who they are, they are too old to be students or the little bastard. Friends, and their children are basically incurable drug addicts, transvestites and homosexuals, stinking!" He made a disgusting expression and waved his fingers, like who Put a fart in front of his nose: "So I am asking for your help, my dear Hopkins, Besib likes small Sasha, he trusts him like I trust you, and small Sasha is smart enough. Agile and strong, he has the calmness and reason beyond his peers. This is very good. Besib is sometimes too rash and savage. He needs someone to take a hand and give him some advice, sober and clear-headed, especially It’s when he is alone...” He is full He said: "Hopkins, nothing can be more impeccable than the friendship that was formed when young, they are good partners, used to be, now, and later - Sasha will be rewarded, I dare to take the Virgin In the name of the swear, Besib is a good boy with a strong relationship."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But before that," Chegard took a plate very thin and crisp The fragrant carasau bread, sprinkled with olive oil and oregano leaves, "I have to ask you for my help, my friend, I believe that you can handle the series of 'transactions' in your body, but not To deny, Xiaoshasha needs a broader space and a commensurate freedom. This is what he deserves. If he is happy where he is, he will be there. If he wants to go, he can immediately Take a step – hey, I admit that those flies that are screaming behind you can’t pose a threat to you, but that’s really annoying, isn’t it?” He slammed into Hopkins Eyes: "Let me find a way to solve this problem once and for all. , old friends, please don't care, everyone has something that they are good at, and what I have is just one of them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is full of enthusiasm The land continued: "The FBI, we can find ways to let the evidence and witnesses disappear, and then try to reapply, asking for a more in-depth investigation - they will get something very different and worthy of people's surprise. Something... Of course, it is in your favor and extremely beneficial. Our best defense lawyers can wave them to knock down every prosecutor who dares to stand in front of them - the result will be innocent, you will be innocent as a Newborn babies. Although it is inevitable to use some money in the process, there are some black dog scorpions (nicknames for FBI agents) who will be embarrassed and may be sent to the Bering Sea to track the atmosphere. The source of warmth, but that's okay, the FBI has to do at least a hundred wrong cases in a year, they don't feel too embarrassed - then your photos can be taken from within the FBI Frist's had to go, even if you have nothing and it is now very similar place, but this is a good thing, is not it? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
