			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aging is more sudden than death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gucci Hefner is willing to give Monica the best, best The food, the best clothes, the best homes, the best servants, the best cars, the best schools, the best hospitals, the best medicines and equipment, the best doctors and nurses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But whoever is standing in front of the glass window outside the intensive care unit, you can see that the person lying on the white bed has not been saved. - If he can see that most of the things that are submerged under the sheets are "people." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monica is only 28 years old this year, full of energy, bright future, it should be a blooming rose, a mature apple, one end Fresh curly little ewe, but what Hopkins sees is just a lively and stupid scent, no hair, no muscles, a white eyeball in the sun's eye socket, lips Dry, criss-crossed deep wrinkles divide her face into countless irregular pieces, and the grayish-yellow skin is like a dirty rag that pulls down softly from the bones—she is early It’s damn, but it’s been dragged down by huge amounts of money. The advanced medical machine fills up nearly half of the room, and an amazing number of pipes are worn out of her body or inserted in, helping or forcing She breathes, ingests nutrition and excretes, while the other half of the experts, doctors, and nurses keep guarding around the clock around the clock, ready to fight to fight with death, in case they take their biggest source of money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She went to an all-night dance after dinner that day, and the next morning when the servant walked into the room, she was already in a coma - like It was cooked by the whole person and the hair fell a bed." Hefner sorrowfully touched her daughter's cheek with her fingertips. The skin slided under the slight pressure of the plastic gloves, thin and wrinkled, just like a post-use Cling film, "They say it is Halford's syndrome, um, maybe it's this name."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hutchinson-Gilford ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, the doctor and I said, but I can't remember it... He said that these patients are usually in the early days of infants and young children. Will show the corresponding symptoms, such as brittle blood vessels, short body, hair and teeth falling off, etc., they say this is a hidden danger of the formation of fertilized eggs - because some genes have fatal defects, such defects Will spread with the division to the embryo, the fetus, and finally all the cells of the baby - but Monica has always been healthy, Almost no serious illness, my mother and her body are also strong, and our parents, Monica’s grandparents and grandparents, are also smooth and live to be over 80 years old. There are no short-lived ghosts in our family, except for my little sister, but his death has nothing to do with any disease. He is too big, and he has been smashed with a knife and is in the middle of the kidney..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins patiently listened to him turning over and over and talking nonstop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His part of his attention has always been on Monica Hefner - Hutchinson-Gilford Dear Syndrome erupts in adulthood There are still less than one hundred in this world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Visit the patient, especially the patient who has almost no hope It will make people feel depressed. Fortunately, Gucci Hefner has a lot of ways to make people cheer up in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Explore young and flexible body with your fingers, stroke the fluffy and smooth hair, look at the bright eyes, lips rubbing each other, tongue twisting Wrapped up, the air is full of sweat and musk... Hefner couldn't help but think of the little girl who likes to show the wonderful in the water and the sun, his little baby, his little pony, he can't wait Want to see her, touch her, he wants to see her on her body? Her youth and calories should be able to easily dispel the shadows and colds brought by this visit - just wait for him to return to the mansion When the girl who told me was told that Betty was on the third floor (the whole three floors were his bedroom), the girl was quite amazed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's the matter," Hefner asked with a good temper. "What problem does she have?" It doesn't matter, he can change one, "Go out? Or the body." Uncomfortable? Oh," he quickly stroked his chin. He shouldn't have forgotten that wonderful close-knit fight: "So Bonnie? She should be free."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think... Bonnie, she is also a bit of a thing." The mixed-race child who probably has this quarter of African descent has a pair of black eyes that are shaped like olives and have a solid body cover. The light and tight brown skin is reminiscent of the brand-name leather goods with good quality and high price – she pointed her way with the line of sight. “You can go and see, but I think she may not be able to get out.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hefner rolled up his lips and he was very upset. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins found that the mixed-race was in the same direction as his temporary home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hefner's bare feet creaked on the floor of the cracked figure, and his face was gloomy, and Hopkins followed him. The two went upstairs together. In the easternmost room on the second floor, they found Betty, Bonnie, Cassie, Lilith, and the torture that seemed to have been separated from low heat and pain. Sasha (which only Big Hopkins can see). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s so wonderful, it’s a good time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie is not too strange here. Since Hopkins and her son got the permission of Hefner to live here, she was assigned to Sasha. The nanny, many girls gloat over this, Bonnie doesn't care much, she can get the money, and she prefers to serve such a guest instead of that - she has had enough of those from 9:00 to 4:00 in the evening Point out the mansions, clubs and men of Guch Hefner, of course, champagne, cigarettes, marijuana or bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also she can practice and adapt in advance, um, normal life - sleep at 9 o'clock in the evening, get up at 6 in the morning, simply take care of yourself ( Don't make heavy makeup), clean and organize the room, bathe in the morning light for breakfast (bread, eggs, milk instead of a glass of whisky), look after the children (extraly easily), and try to make a one while borrowing the free kitchen while the child is taking a nap What is an apple pie? God knows that she had lived this decade before ten years. At that time, she was abhorrent to this monotonous and barren life, and now it is what she is most eager for. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie can't remember how she got out of the town, imaginable, she must be as beautiful, energetic and ambitious as Betty now. exuberant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is simply a cycle of not saying good or bad, she went out, she came back, and then another person made up the position she left, and then a few more In the year, if the latter is not lucky enough, she will return, and another young and beautiful girl will decide to go out and try it out – with her fleeting youth, she may succeed, maybe not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But someone always comes back and there is always someone going out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I still have a little hope, Bonnie thought, I hope my dream can become a reality, when I can't, I pin this hope on other People's body - otherwise I can't explain why I have to help Betty, this little idiot that has no brain has already brought me trouble, and I never know how to be grateful, but I will still stretch my hand when necessary. For example, just now, like now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s also very likely that I’m Lily Wel, her luck is so good, I’m happy to give her some trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing?" Hefner asked angrily: "In my guest's room?" The room was a mess, like a drink Drunk elephants danced inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She wants to drive me away!" Betty, sitting on the carpet, screamed and screamed: "She doesn't have this power, Mr. Hefner, she wants to fire me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have, I can." Lilith Mayer took out the white teeth when she said the word "can". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two security guards stood helplessly behind Lilith. They were driven by Lilith Meyer to expel Betty, but Betty, who was not good, immediately hid into Mr. Hopkins's room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Bonnie and Cassie insisted on waiting for Mr. Gucci Hefner to return - no matter what Lilith Meyer wants to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lillismer is a new favorite, but Bonnie and Cassie are not good roles. Before entering the big house, they were quite The famous bunny girl is also very popular after this (no matter which aspect), at the very least, Mr. Hefner knows what they are called. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They also remember that Mr. Hefner mentioned the cover of next week, the best playmate - the default candidate seems to be called Betty. Others may not know, but they have been working here for a few years. They know very well about Gucci Hefner. This little black-skinned man is famous for his anger and incomprehension. Who knows what happens after a minute? what's up? None of them want to offend, and work hard to naturally grind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have to say that their choice is quite correct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gucci Hefner frowned, crossed a broken glass plate, and put it in front of Betty to twist her chin, he was like a veteran The antique appraisers carefully watched the wound that had not been able to find a doctor to handle it. "Yes," he whispered, then raised his voice: "Hurry up and look for William, damn, let him I am teasing you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was not fired, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You Would you like to be fired? Give you thirty seconds!” Hefner growled and said, “Go away from me, or you can make your wish come true.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Betty jumped up, like a rabbit in the autumn woods, agile through the crowd, and had a sneer before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
