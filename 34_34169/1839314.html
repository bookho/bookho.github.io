			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besb ​​and Sasha’s body sink in the cold water, only the part above the shoulder, the flash of their eyes and the reflection of the moonlight on the raft Similarly, Charlie and Charlie's fathers were not aware of their existence, or that their attention was completely occupied by sorrow and anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie stood there for a long time without saying a word, "You are ashamed of me," and finally he will not have a boy of this age. Calmly said: "You always wanted me to be a tough guy like you, but I became a sissy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't think so. The head of the team said that as long as it is an individual, you can hear the weakness and weakness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I should go back," said Charlie: "Mr. Head."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He head Did not go back, leaving only the head of the group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bessib thought that the head of the group would leave soon. He waited for a few minutes. The head of the team just stood still and hung his head, like He was put on a heavy shackle, and when he finally got some action - he took out a pack of cigarettes from his trouser pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame from the mouth of the lighter illuminates itself and the head of the head. The lighter is a military windproof type, not small and exquisite, it looks a little old-fashioned , square, and its owner is very similar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the smoked cigarettes, I will know, white Marlboro, because there are also people doing smuggling work on the sea god island, this is a kind of fragrance, pure Tobacco tobacco cigarettes are full of strength, men like it, but in the three-quarters of the federal zone, such cigarettes will be heavily taxed, so the people of Poseidon will drive the truck to the light tax zone. Then, they open the joints and transport them back to the heavy tax zone. After the break-up, they are sold to trusted convenience stores and small supermarkets. Although the profits are not comparable to drugs, it is still good to give young people a try. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How long do you think he will stay here?" asked Besib. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know," Sasha said. "But let's go out - the water is a bit cold, I will solve this."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of white-backed fish hurriedly swam from the head of the head. They were just looking down at the head of the ash that they had made and swallowed away by the water. The night is also the time for the fish to sleep. What drove the small fish out of their nests? Snake, or otter? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are dangerous for children, and snakes may be poisonous. The otter may carry a dangerous rabies virus. He raised a hand and placed it on his holster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he saw Besib and Sasha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the team’s first reaction was to see if the two children were injured, and then he realized that the two seemingly calm young people were not like him. That way, when they came to him, he thought that every sentence he and Charlie had just said might have been heard by them - but what about it? Just this evening, his son, his Charlie, has admitted in front of everyone that he is a homosexual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he is a gay father. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that he should severely reprimand these two daring little guys, but he finds that his head is empty. Extreme frustration made him not want to say anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha is near the head, reaching out and pressing on his bare, furry arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A kind of...feeling, wonderful. Beautiful, from the places he touched to the wider and deeper places, the tired and bitter ice quickly melted away, the fence of the guard was gradually removed, and the pleasure of the senses and thoughts was like ambush under the snow. Plants are slow and waking up, and your world is pure and flawless. Colorful, for a moment, you will want to die immediately, so that you can stay at this moment forever - Chegar. Bisangdi once described it as something more terrible than drugs, and it is not wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha didn't want to change the memory of the head, let him think that he had never seen them wet tonight from the water. silly. But he can adjust the order of the memories, and the head of the team will see their time a little earlier. After dinner, they will have half an hour of spare time - the head of the memory will be happy to welcome this change, anyway, he and Charlie's conversation is not suitable for being known by a third person - as long as he is willing. The memory will automatically make up for the unreasonable part of him, such as the difference between the sparkling golden water in the sunset and the silvery water surface flashing in the moonlight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He used this technique in pimps, Abby and the coach. The two children were replaced after the arrival of the goods. He took a small nail in their mind and forced them to instinctively hate. The two faces - in the daily newspapers, on the box of milk, on the poles and on the walls, the slightest rubbing of their eyes will make them unable to stop the irritability, who will go to the deliberate What do memories make you feel uncomfortable? - Abby and his men didn't recognize the two time bombs from beginning to end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the team tried to identify the two people standing in front of him, the students of Grande, who were reflected by the river than Sandy and Hopkins. The sun shone into the eyes, his eyes could not be opened, and the heat was hot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing?" He said, the bee screamed in his ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just want to clean up before going to bed," Sasha said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head is a bit confused because he remembers they have gone to bed. He is confirming that everyone is going to sleep and Charlie... Yes, he wants to talk to Charlie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can we go back to the tent?" asked Besib. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Charlie?" asked the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Charlie is in the tent." Sasha said, carefully not to arouse the head of the memory of the conversation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I love Charlie very much," said the head. "Do you, daddy love you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Bishb shook the hand of Sasha, and Sasha took him back: "Of course, Mr. Head, they love us very much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "So..." The head of the team moved his feet a little hesitantly: "Will you lie to him? Deceive your father?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This round Silence to Sasha: "...will," he said, "will."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head shook his head incredulously: "Why do sons deceive themselves?" What about your father?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe he will be punished for this," Sasha said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But I have never punished him for anything," he thought, his eyes showed a real pain: "I love him, He is the only thing his mother left for me. We have nothing but each other. I changed him diapers, fed milk, hugged him out to the sun, taught him to ride a bicycle... I don't understand why he lied to me, actually I had a hunch a long time ago. I asked him if he likes a boy more than a girl. He said no, he likes a girl. He always told me that he likes girls, likes milk/child, but on the second day. He updated his blog and publicly declared that he was a homosexual, and then like a little girl, showing love to a boy on the basketball court... Why didn't he tell me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So what do you do?" Sasha said: "If he told you the truth, take him to the psychiatrist?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Why not?" the head said, "I have seen from books, boys, or girls, Interested in same-sex at an age--as long as they are guided, they will not become homosexual, they will fall in love with a different sex, marry and have children, and spend their lives peacefully."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Charlie is still a child," he said. "He doesn't understand what a gay person will face. He just wants to be fashionable... he will understand."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He made a difficult gesture: "Sometimes, I went to school to see him. I saw someone coming from the opposite side of him, deliberately hitting him with his shoulder, someone followed. He called sissy, gay, and reminded others that he was coming over with his horn; his mobile phone often received malicious text messages, and if he replied, there would be more inferior words and threatening letters to fill his short message box; He went to the club activities, several ten-year-old boys surrounded him in the park and gave him a good fight; a friend he used to watch was next to him, but he said nothing; no one invited him again. Go dancing, skateboarding, swimming, they see him I can't escape. Throughout the holidays, he can only stay in the house himself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you think this is good? Is this the life he wants?" The ground shook his head again: "He will regret it, there will be one day. But... I am his father..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice is gradually weak, stunned, The confusion and the forced anger of suffocating paralyzed his mind, he will fall into a state of unconsciousness for a few minutes, enough to leave the sib and Sasha back to the tent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
