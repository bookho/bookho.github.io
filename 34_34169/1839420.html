He didn't quite naturally lick the "Don" who crouched in Hopkins's arms and cried in tears. "I think he needs to be quiet for a while." He said, went out, took the woman, and closed the door. And left Sasha, Besib and the "baby" in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib has put down all the defenses, his body is heavy like a drunken drunkard, drastically falling, Sasha had to put him down, let him sit on the carpet, and then sit down on his own, Besib's forehead against his shoulder, tears soon passed through a well-made new shearing wool coat and a hundred Twenty cotton shirts - the young leader of the thugs lapped their knees, and they cried for five minutes with their brothers, only to take a deep breath and restore calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crying in front of Sasha Hopkins is nothing to be shy, anyway, it’s not the first time, he wiped the coat of Sasha Face, this old and expensive dress is spoiled thoroughly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all the pauses, he glanced at the crib. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb[ .; "When does it not cry?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From the moment you cry His ruthless brother said: "He must have been stunned by your talents. Not every adult is better than a baby in crying. Do you want to come again?" I have a shirt here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib shrugged, he has been used to such injuries. When Sasha talks to someone close to him, he occasionally becomes extremely sharp and mean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He, or she?" Besib replied: "You know, it's sly and sly, no hands and no feet, no uterus and no yinjing. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But that doesn't prevent him from being my child."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha said . While pushing the big kids around, walked to the crib, carefully avoiding the same scars of smell and color, and mentioning the little creature that kept calling his father and father in his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three weeks from Manchester’s new school day, the sea in the Western West is a bit cold. The water near the sea god island is already warm as a mother's embrace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib found Sasha on the beach. Maybe someone doesn't remember that it is the seaside. After all, it has been ten years since, the cold, slender, suffocating bat nest still exists, the reef on the shoal remains the same, and there are still not many people. Willing to get here - and the blond boy has become a man. A father. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha Hopkins carries a small bag and the baby. He only wore linen shirts and trousers. Lying in the fine sand of almost the same color as his hair, the shirt was tossed by the little guy lying on his chest and stomach, leaving only one button still standing. The sea rushed up and infiltrated his trousers. The busy little hermit crab climbed from his toes on his instep, and the salty sea breeze swept over him, constantly and in vain trying to wet the hair and clothes wet by the sea. Blow dry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Sasha discovered him, the big locust (Bishb really didn’t want to call his brother’s child, but no matter where it came from Said that the adjective is quite accurate.) He sharply lifted the whole upper body and a quarter of the lower body. He could not see the dullness and fragility of the newborn baby. Its muscles are more than steel springs. The strength is strong, the reaction is lightning fast, and the other thing to note is that it can endure hunger and thirst for a long time, although it will make it weak - there are already thirty-six hours before Chiz finds them. Eating, empty stomach, ** dry, according to her, the child's hunger strike time is longer than her, because she has no milk, and it can not chew bread and sausage for the time being. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What needs to be added is that it has no reproductive system and large intestine, kidney is missing, bladder deformity, no ** no urethra, small intestine directly connected to the abdomen The small hole, like a bird, if it is a general so-called mermaid syndrome baby, it has already died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a gene derived from the father that has succeeded in struggling to survive. It’s been an actor from birth, with an extraordinary brain and body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are fourteen fertilized eggs?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Catherine has destroyed them "After personally giving birth to such a monster, this annoying aunt was frightened. This is obviously not the cute little baby she imagined. She wants to kill it, but the baby manipulates Chiz to run away with it. Catherine had to destroy the remaining fertilized eggs first - Anthony Hopkins personally took the record from her mind that day - indeed, the fertilized egg was originally something very fragile, no longer There is a second little monster that appears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is too stupid," Besib commented. "Since knowing that Chiz Carson is a biaozi who has been killed by a virus, she can count on her to give birth to a winged little angel." He looked down and looked at his friend's belly again. The one on the group, this is something that people can't describe with beauty and ugliness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remove which parts of the creator are intentionally smeared, eyes, arms, ears, gender features and gaps between the legs, the rest can be said It is better than even other babies, but it is this kind of seamlessness that is similar to the seamless, which is the most uncomfortable place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thing turns his head, its lower limb strength and waist strength are so strong that it can be easily rotated and moved - the size of the pear is facing away Si Bu thought for a while, it picked up his mouth and made a loud snoring, a little white water sprayed onto Besib's trousers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it spitting to me?" Besib said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Obviously it remembers being pointed to by a Browning 1935." Sasha said lazily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishb took a bit of a maliciously extended toe, poked the head of the thing, and then the thing bite his second The toe, the sharp little teeth pierced into his flesh, and Besib lifted his foot. It was like a fish biting the bait, swaying in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have to behave so consistently with your age?" Sasha sarcastically, pressed behind the neck of the little thing that was half-lifted by Besib. press. It immediately slammed and fell back on his father's stomach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although Manchester does not explicitly prohibit the regulation of keeping babies or pets in student residences," Besib said: "But I don't think professors will be happy." Go to a little reptile crawling up and down on their podium - do you want to give it to Mr. Hopkins?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Or do you have a better candidate?” Sasha asked, Anthony Hopkins was also a strong controller when Besib left Poseidon and Chekale Bissau was weaker than ever before. Of course, he can look at this little monster, but this may make many people uneasy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is one," Besib said: "But I am thinking about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martina is waiting for the final result in her room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sister Sandra pushed the door open and walked in. Her expression made Maldina chilly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She took a deep breath. I hope that I don't cry so quickly: "No... is it? Or is it not?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandra shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the original plan, they will become a shackle with a long and strong surname, and sister Sandra will become the future of Tang "The wife, sister Marttina will marry his most trusted friends and brothers." Sasha Hopkins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This message was brought to them by their father before Christmas. There is no better gift than this. No girl doesn't want to be Tang's wife, but if they want to marry Sasha Hopkins, they won't be disappointed wherever they go, even if he is a surname. But it is foreseeable that he is deeply loved by Besib. Bissand and can really be smart. He will have a place by his side, the future is boundless, and he is so beautiful, tall, thin but strong, his blond hair Like the light in the portrait, the light behind the head of the Son, and his eyes, stacked in three colors, the lead ash in the sky during thunderstorms, the shallow sea in the sun under the scorching sun, all the emerald blue , rare, violets from gems, flowers, and moonlight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Marttina knew that her future husband was Sasha Hopkins, she was so happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was even desperate when she knew that Sasha Hopkins was forced to have a deformed child (in accordance with the custom, she only had this right after marriage) And the obligation to take care of him, and promised to take care of him like taking care of his children, love him, just because half of his body belongs to the blood of Sasha Hopkins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandra couldn’t help but feel embarrassed because her marriage to Besib and Bissau was not affected, but also in advance, which made her feel very Uncomfortable, but this gift is not transferable, and the person Martini loves is not Besib. Bisang, but Sasha Hopkins,<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maltina is crying very badly. Sandra hugged her head, and her sister's tears soaked the fabric in her abdomen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sentiment of a little girl did not affect the men of Poseidon . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Celegal. Bisangdi is a person who is a personality, since he has decided to get rid of Masoye and Poseidon Island who have worked hard for decades. , then you don't have to grind and waste your time. After Besib killed most of the old people who are not obedient, Anthony Hopkins has taken a very good position in the rights system of Poseidon. Those who sit on the chairs are not the old folks of Chegal, the peers of Besib. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A wedding will be a suitable period. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Various golden bread piled up on a table with red and white checkered tablecloths, and some even protruded from the sea-colored rattan basket, where the basket is at your fingertips A large plate of olive oil, butter and sweet and sour sauce; the ingredients of the pancakes are second only to the bread, they are placed in the shape of a peacock, with cheese, spicy spinach and olives; the sauce has been mixed The noodles (and there are more than a dozen) are concentrated at the other end of the table, with a large plate of cooked crabs (large can not fit into the plate), lobsters and fish, these sweet and sweet little cute A few hours ago, I was able to rush in the sea freely; I cooked in stainless steel barrels of oysters, snails, sea rainbow, green mussels and white wine, olive oil and sea salt, together with green squash and tomato; Six chefs are responsible for the day's barbecue work, mutton, beef in pounds. Pork and beef liver, chickens on the dark red charcoal fire give a hearty coke aroma, two chefs responsible for cheese and dumplings and three bartenders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, essential, a band. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All foods can be said to be extremely fresh and rough (as opposed to Western-style star restaurants), but this integration of Poseidon Island preferences They drank wine, ate delicious food, danced happily, and it will last for three days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martina did not attend the wedding, according to her sister’s statement. She is unfortunately sick. Although everyone knows well, who will raise it at this time? Maybe not in the future, Maldina as a "Tang" wife and sister, she will have a good marriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib. Bisangdi as the groom. She danced with the bride Sandra. Then with one of the bridesmaids. His mother-in-law and the wife or daughter of two other old men who supported him jumped out of the lively venue after a dance, and Beppe watched him walk into the house, a few minutes later. He appeared on the terrace and sat with Chekal Bissance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you really decide not to let Martina be the wife of Sasha?" asked Chegal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishb didn’t look at his father and nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not very good," said Chegal. "Although I don't have Hopkins, I can probably guess what you think, you." I want to support Little Hopkins and let him do what I want you to do, but you enter the Western Continent as a businessman, and he is a... What?”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He will enter law school."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, law school, I don’t think you want him to be a lawyer. No, if that is the case, he can still marry Martina," said Chegal. "There is only one possibility. He can't marry Martina because a person who is going to be in politics cannot have such a clear connection with Poseidon. This is simply a handle and stain like a whale, even if everyone knows that the shadow behind him is called Masoye."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For those people Hopkins is easier for them to accept, he is not a new person, he is an old man."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Last name." Galle slickly said that it was not only him that "Tang" wanted to enter the circle with money and force, but without exception they all failed: "There is our money."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," Besib smiled, and this was his first true smile at the wedding: "He will do well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp "Hopkins has the ability to make everyone like him." Chegal said, indeed, even if they don't have the ability, they can do it, but only two Hopkins are kind. Goods, they don't like everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are also preparing to return to Manchester?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will finish college."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You will be the first 'Tang' ever born in Manchester."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It sounds good," Besib said: "No? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How long do you need?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two years."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So that's it," said Chegaler, raising his skinny fingers: "Go back to your wedding. In today's days, the bride can be left for a long time. It’s not a good sign.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The groom returned to the venue, he smiled (after all, this is a day worthy of a smile) and found his friend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha today is the best man, white three-piece suit, according to the rules of the sea god island people, no tie or bow tie, white lambskin single shoes. He was talking indifferently and gently to a girl, and the girl immediately threw away when she saw Besib coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dancing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bridegroom and groomsman who are currently on the wedding are coming to their own feet. This is the most visited by the people of Poseidon in the first fifteen years, or they may be in the last 50 years. I will continue to look at it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So say two years - Besib, you will fall into the hell of credit, if you really want to graduate in two years - and Mr. Sangdi is definitely not happy, and his plan does not include this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is not his friend," Besib conscience Nothing to say: "Since our old father has taken care of us for 20 years, then it should not matter for another two years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha He gave a glance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't be like this," Besib said: "I know that you are your father's frosted sugar cake."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't tell me that you have never been sweeter than Chekal. Bisangdi." Sasha said, then he got a silence for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...there is one percent of the time," Besib said tiredly and bitterly. "I will steal, for the money, status, vanity and rights, I am happy that my father is dying, I will go. Calculate how much benefit his death can bring to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha slightly paused, he thought he was only slightly stabbed so small ( The people of Poseidon Island seem to be very jealous of exposing their true feelings. Who knows is a very accurate knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I used to think that I would not be so hypocritical," Besib raised his hand. "In fact, I have to say Besib. "It's amazing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two years," said Old Bissham "Maybe I can still see my grandson born."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can still see the birth of your great-grandson," said Anthony Hopkins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is Tony, Tom or Jerry," said Ms. Sandi. "It wouldn't be Chekal or Bissan anyway." —” He sighed. “It’s a heart-rending boy. He even has a soft heart for those who want to eat him.” Then, do you think about it?”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't pretend to be stupid," said Bisang: "I said, your kid, how are you going? "?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you are talking about that," Anthony Hopkins turned his back to the sun, his hands crossed and quiet, and he was right. Sitting on the ground: "I still hold my original opinions and opinions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The child is becoming a good person," said Sangdi. "It doesn't matter, things have changed. Besib is interested in supporting him in politics. - At least the apparent innocence is good for him, but I always think he will be different from us."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&n Bsp;&nbsp;He touched his skin's loose fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you ever thought about it? He may be our enemy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
