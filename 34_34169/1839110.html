			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha was frustrated by the man who fell into anger, his back slammed on the wall, and the doctor jumped up and ran over, just to catch him. - The child slammed his head and stopped breathing. When the doctor gave first aid, his eyelids could not be opened, but he kept vibrating constantly. After a few minutes, he began to retching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man pulled up his shirt, two semi-circular, almost end-to-end tick marks on the light brown skin turned from white to deep, because Very small, it looks like a cute little ornament. This does not constitute a hindrance to his body. Even pain is just a matter of seconds. But the fact that a child, especially a child he despised, scorned and hated, once again hurts seriously. Destroyed the confidence and pride of this young man, his muscles on his face, his eyes protruding, his nostrils growing up, his shoulders bowed like a bull with an electric shock, and the slender curved blue current slamming on his arm. Flowing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked over to the doctor, and the doctor immediately stood up and took Sasha back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give me the little bastard!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, Mr. Martin Schott The doctor responded politely and further increased the distance from Martin: "You need to calm down, I think, today's inquiry can be over."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I have this power!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," the doctor removed agilely before Martin's finger touched him: "You don't, you don't have If you are already suspected of abuse of authority and excessive authority, please stop, otherwise I will report it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin stopped, he The face was terrible, and the eyes were turning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be careful!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doctor didn’t figure out where the sound of this weak tone came from The next moment he realized that it was a reminder given by the child in his arms... warning! A sharp and sharp pain hit the bottom of his foot like a lot of people who accidentally touched the bare high-voltage wires. He was slammed out of the current by the current, turning his eyes and staring at Venus. Fortunately, he still had a little consciousness and was able to direct him through the double doors that were not closed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The double door swayed and the doctor could see Martin Shaw from the gap, showing a wild dog-like smile to the doctor, hanging down The side of the hand pressed the edge of the stainless steel dissection table, the electric current of the zipper was under the cover of his body along the metal legs of the dissection table, while the floor of the dissection room was actually tiled, but each tile was The edges are all inlaid with shiny copper strips - the characteristics of the retro style, very beautiful, the problem is that it is now equally dangerous - the conductivity of copper is second only to silver. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin came slowly to them and was able to see others as a wolf, especially if he caused it, which made him very happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give him to me," he threatened to raise a hand and let the current flow between the nail and the palm: "I just want to beat him up." Lessons learned from this little animal, let him cooperate," he pulled his nose and revealed a disgusting expression: "Believe not to hurt his life, just a finger, or an ear," he let the current In the palm of your hand, it becomes a floating ball: "Throw him down and run away from it, or try to taste the electric chair with him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The ability to use peers is forbidden,” the doctor sighed. He felt his breath in his breath: “You will be punished.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Maybe," Martin raised his hand, and the horrible ball seemed to fly out of his hands at any time: "But I won't let you die, as long as you are still alive, the punishment of the institution will not be too heavy. My brother told me that the organization is always lacking, especially the action group. As long as you can do it, they always close one eye."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, the doctor thought that he had a moment to put down the child in his arms, but Sasha raised his hand to grab his collar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come on," he said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine rushed in from the double door at the other end like a lioness who lost her cub, she sent out while seeing Sasha A deafening roar, even overshadowed the bang of the stainless steel door hitting the wall. She rushed to Martin Shaw and threw him down. The two men sent out very consistently when they touched each other. The bitter shouts, and then they wrestled without any image - the fight between them is neither ornamental nor practical. In fact, these are full of kicking, biting the nose, catching hair, etc. The fight is more similar to the war between the little shrews and the little rogues in the backcountry. They are tumbling, biting, punching, and incoherent curses in the sacred pool full of Formalin's solution smell. ridiculous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The danger is only to attempt to separate their Abel (he is lucky or unfortunately a new partner of Catherine) to know a little bit, he is touching At the same time they were hit by the pain of both current and nerve stimulation, and almost shocked on the spot - if there was not a good doctor at the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had to work with the doctor and watched them play for five minutes, and exhausted all their strength and softness in the five minutes. Exhaustedly twisted together - at this point they are like a pair of close friends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doctor informed the security department that they took Catherine and Martin, and Sasha, they all needed treatment and rest, and Abel pleaded with the invitation of the former. Compared with those white and clean physical or psychological treatment rooms, he is more willing to go to the bar inside the "fortress" to drink a few cups to comfort his tired body and mind. Anyway, they are not as vulnerable as ordinary people. Occasionally, one or two times, there is really nothing to be surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened?" Abel asked bluntly. He and Catherine had just finished the task. Once they came back, they found that Sasha was brought in. The morgue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Martin Shawd needs Sasha Hopkins to cooperate with the investigation." The doctor asked for a cup of grapefruit juice and then ordered two or three drops of brandy inside. . He asked Abel for a cup of heated, spiced wine that would calm the stomach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He is still a child." Abel shook his head: "And he loves his father, you can't get anything from him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not try to know how." The doctor shrugged his shoulders and then made a long sigh: "If you are willing to persuade Catherine, I mean, let her The intelligence team may be willing to behave more tenderly from the child's mouth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You won't succeed," Abel Unwilling to push away the empty glass: "Catherine loves him more than his own eyes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
