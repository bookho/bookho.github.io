			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are condescending. I can see not only the two boxers who have stood on the boxing ring, but also the decent gamblers around them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These eager guests are watching the boxing match. It’s quite like watching a wonderful opera, lovers are cuddling together, couples bring The child, occasionally whispered a word or two, drink some soft drinks provided by the gym free of charge, some people bring their own wine, the gym does not provide wine, but if someone wants to let their blood boil, they will not To stop, after all, the gamblers who are fainting are often out of control, and they will cast more bets again and again until the pockets are empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two boxers shook hands and shook hands before the start of the game. They stood face to face, the two were a bit similar, or most of the boxers were like this. It’s like an anthropomorphic opportunity to use the look and body to give the boxing sport a little bit of a thin bun on the head, hidden under the thick eyelids of the squatting, squinting eyes, 挨The lips and nose that have to be deformed too many times and have to be deformed, even if they are healed, they can still see the chin of the severity of their fragmentation. The bull is generally short and thick neck, thick chest, muscular limbs, wrapped around. Hands with bandages wearing boxing gloves - a red glove, a black glove. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are all first-line fighters, experienced, muscles and bone marrow have not been squeezed out by the game one after another, just the red box looks It is older than the black box. Less than fifteen seconds into the opening, the black boxing hit a lightning strike, hit the cheek of the red glove and hit him on the ground. When the loser wanted to stand up, his assistant screamed. He was stopped, and the referee counted for nine seconds before he stood up. At this time, people only saw the punch and even the evil eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is quite unfavorable for the red boxing, and the next two minutes is simply the performance time of the black box. His footsteps are brisk, his movements are agile, his fists are heavy like he can push his opponent directly into the concrete floor, but the red box can only be evaded. Stop, and use the twist to delay time while avoiding it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first round that was boring was boring, the gamblers began to prepare for the second bet, and the people who had just watched quietly started to whisper, whisper, in the boxer They leaned against the soft-skinned pillars, and when they were resting in their own corners, the bet gamblers got up and walked under the boxing ring to look at their state, as if they were looking at a horse or a dog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you think?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Abby asked, he put the fingers of both hands together. The smile is like a pimp who helps a 70-year-old woman to pull a business. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is two good boxers." Besib said politely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No doubt," Judah said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought you would be a little disappointed - Tom is a good boy," Abby shrugged and shrugged his shoulders: "The old guy is a bit disappointing." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have a group of quiet guests."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Constantine. Saying that everyone's attention is led in the other direction, he has almost no northern accent and is humble. The expression is mild, but if he is the four thorns of the ring of Crovin, Anthony Hopkins's old knowledge - then it will definitely not be a good gentleman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Really, those people don’t stand up and wave their fists, they’re in the same place, they’re never shouting or screaming, they’re looking at an indifferent and alienated attitude. Two strong men are strangled in the boxing ring. It is like a funeral to make the whole stadium quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lafayette is a new city, but it belongs to the thirteen districts. People who can settle here are highly educated," Abby Bently bent over, "including me, I have two bachelor's certificates. Everyone has a legitimate career. The income is stable, taxed on time, law-abiding, reasonable and generous," Abby said incessantly: " They will never mutter for a little money. They can't be tangled. Look, you can look at it, give it, take it back, it's cash, no check, no signature, everything is so clean, Clearly understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked to the front of the box and pointed to his guests to see the gray-green notes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black boxing prevails, he only used red gloves The influential eye continuously hits him from the direction with an uppercut, and after he climbs up hard, he uses his flexible footsteps and slamming to push the opponent onto the rope. If the red glove wants to fall down When he broke out, he forced him to stand upright in the opposite direction, and then used a more vicious one to break the opponent's attempt—whether he wanted to fight back, delay or escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red gloves can only use their own skills, constantly touch each other's biceps, shake their heads, so that they will not be hit too heavy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few seconds before the end of this round, the injured eye of the red glove was hit hard again, and the blood filled him. Half face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end, the referee stepped forward and asked the red box to deny the exit. He got a negative answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a short one-minute break, the red boxing assistants rinsed his eyes with ice water. He clenched his teeth, his hands straight open, leaning against the pillars and ropes, screaming, bloody ice flowing through his neck, chest, and wet his shorts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first half of the third round, the red box still seems to remain precautionary or powerless, and the black boxing offensive is still embarrassing, but as long as it is a discerning person, Can see the problem - he spent too much effort in the first two rounds, he needs to rest now, probably only takes two minutes, one minute is enough, but his opponent has been waiting for this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A subtle, fleeting gap, the red boxing twisted nearly half of the body, the arm formed a strong bow in the air, and the huge fist passed through The gap in the road hit the chin of the black box. This was awesome. The black boxed feet flew off the ground. When he fell, his head hit the pillar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black boxing also stood up for nine seconds before standing up, the moment he held the rope straight up, he swayed and spit out Not much, with blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next red boxing has no chance for the opponent, he is almost not defensive and dodge, but aggressively approaching the opponent again and again, he is solid and accurate The fist is not afraid of the pine hammer on the steak. The first two rounds of his fists have been returned, plus a 50% interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black boxing attempted to hit the other side again, once he knocked the red box to the ground, and then the red box set him to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello, fight, fight. Their feet screamed on the ground of the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two boxers were bloody and exhausted. Their beatings are unruly and unscrupulous, and the referees only open them when they are too full or when they are so troublesome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red boxing set a few punches (or even soft) hit the opponent's chin. Suddenly, the black box stopped the defense and Attack, he retreated, blood, teeth and broken bones rushed out of his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey," Abby said. "It seems that he still remembers that Tom's chin had been operated last week."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is firmly against the low wall of the velvet tent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red boxing is looking up, Besib can’t be sure if their eyes are in contact, but the latter immediately turns like a god of death Before he went, before the black box had not completely fallen, he moved and used his last strength to make a middle on the opponent's face, even if there was no Sasha and Besib to surpass the ordinary people's vision. The people in the box can clearly see that every bunch of flesh on the beaten face is as intense as the jelly concentrated in the bullet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may be the last time the black boxing fell, the referee started a few seconds, ten seconds ended, the black boxing assistant immediately rushed up, from under the rope loop Remove the black box and move it to the stretcher that was already prepared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The referee raised the red gloved hand, the winner seemed to want to smile, then he lowered his head slightly and vomited violently - like a high pressure Like the faucet, the black blood is mixed with messy things, one bite, then another bite. Originally a theater, the venue was empty, and the performance of reflection and conduction was still good. Even in the box, the sound of vomiting was as clear as it was in the ear, and there was confusing and painful crying from the stretcher. Zhang shattered face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strong bloody suffocation and the smell of stomach secretions linger around the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can this game exceed 50,000?" Judas asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can," Abby said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So how many games can there be here?" asked Crovin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
