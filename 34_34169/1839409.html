			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qiz Carson is very familiar with the pain. She was beaten in the Poseidon incident, after which, in order to get rid of the white powder The torture and temptation, she cut herself with a knife, or deliberately poured hot hot tea into her throat directly - the doctor gave her treatment, some of which have great side effects, brain, stomach and liver, knees and back The bone will have a short or long pain because of its influence, but she has not tried such pain, one hand reaches into her stomach, the specific and important organ for women, the thing inside Then dig it out, little by little - she screamed and jumped up, but without success, Catherine sat on her and covered her mouth with sheets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, hey, hey." Catherine whispered, "Don't say anything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The girl gasped, and for a moment she ran a lot of sweat, infiltrated her hair and the sheets under her body. Her hair was golden and red, which is what people usually call copper, rich and moist, with Natural curls, very beautiful, Catherine knows that she has been very embarrassed for some time, but those things are gone forever, she now looks better than her girl of the same age, tight and smooth skin I can't find a mole and freckles. The lips are full of summer berries, the chest is full, the waist is slender but powerful, and there are two straight long legs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chiz stared angrily at Catherine, not only because of the pain Catherine had imposed on her—not the flesh, but the spirit, she had already confirmed, Instead, Catherine's behavior dragged her out of the spiritual world of Sasha Hopkins. She was about to succeed. She was so close to him that she could touch it as soon as she reached out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Anthony Hopkins is here." Catherine leaned down and her lips pressed against Chiz's ear bones. "He is most sensitive to this. If he finds a stranger who dares to stay in his temple without his son's permission, he will give you tens of thousands of times of pain - as opposed to my little disciplinary action. He can do it. This is my personal experience - not a joke, not a threat, girl, I am explaining the facts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chiz Carson did not speak, just now The effects of pain have not been completely eliminated. She knew that if she wanted to say something immediately, it would be impossible, it would only become a series of ridiculous, intermittent incoherence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine understands this very well. She feels that the girl under her body is trying to relax her body. The women who are more and more important in the organization as time goes by, slowly relieve their strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So you gave up?" About five minutes later. Chiz Carson said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine raised an eyebrow, she had changed to a chair with a book on her knee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You give up, I mean, take Sasha Hopkins away from his father - you are full of Anthony Hopkins Fear, so you are shrinking."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A self-righteous, stupid innocent lady, Catherine said in her heart. But she is much more mature than she was a decade ago. At least she has learned to perfuse: "I never gave up," she opened the book: "But I can't violate the will of Sasha. He doesn't want to leave Anthony Hopkin. Si, he loves him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's because he has been controlled by Anthony Hopkins," Chiz Carson turned and she The eyes are amber, like gold in the light, shiny. There are hidden ups and downs in the calm tone: "From the time he was a baby, he lived in what his father had created. Wrong, dangerous. Growing up in a false environment - yes, I have to admit He is the father of Sasha. In addition to his blood relationship, Anthony Hopkins raised and cared for him. He has given him everything, including those sinful things. He may indeed love it. Sasha, but that doesn't mean he doesn't instill dirty thoughts and opinions into his mind. He doesn't care about Sasha Hopkins becoming another criminal who is cast aside and alienated - you It’s very clear that Catherine, you have tried to take away Sasha so that he can get rid of this terrible nightmare, but you have failed, and then you have never tried it.”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I must consider Sasha, I can't force him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But he is not perfect! In thought He is not as good as a fifteen-year-old boy in a rebellious period! He almost only believes His father, his words are regarded as a standard, his words, his life, his study, his hobbies, his father arranged for him, and even his friends - Besib. Bisangdi! The future of Tang "The leader of the mob!" she screamed. "Anthony Hopkins has found such a friend for his only child. A boy who can make someone else's head in the teens! A natural killer. Mad! What do you think he would do with Sasha? Fishing, camping or playing football?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
