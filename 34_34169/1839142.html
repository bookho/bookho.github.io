			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the fifth week after school, the school bus full of children has already left, and the courtyard of St. Thomas Church Elementary School suddenly becomes quiet and clean. Some golden ochre has appeared in the thick branches of the phoenix tree, some of them still stubbornly cling to the branches, but others have been blown off the ground by the wind, falling on the dark green lawn, sapphire pool or On the olive-brown basketball court; it has been raining for a few days, and the Hibiscus tree has blossomed. This shrub-like plant can grow as tall as the phoenix tree. The flower looks like a ball of hair, a filament of roots. Sticking out from the bottom of the pale yellow ochre, the roots are transparent, and then from bottom to top, the color of potassium permanganate is present in shallow and deep colors - that is, the beautiful transparent purple red, they are in the slender branches in twos and threes. A larger group, like colored clouds, is densely paved around the pink clouds, which are shaped like mimosa. They open at about 10 o'clock in the morning, at night. Closed after seven o'clock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flowers of Hibiscus are very fragrant, but not as sweet as sweet-scented osmanthus or silk flowers, not as rich as roses, it is in the nasal cavity of Streif There is a taste of herbal tea - in this fragrance, Kemira came in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She saw that Streif was sitting in a seat in the classroom, that seat belonged to the child, and he had to put two legs when he was sitting Qufu, in front of him is two pieces pieced together, covered with paper, she approached, only to find those are children's paintings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A variety of trees, many children draw houses, dogs, birds... children, this child is likely to be themselves, this Children of the age group like to paint themselves... Some children paint themselves very tall, even more than trees and houses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please sit, Kemira." Streif said: "Please sit down, please sit down," he said diligently. "Mind to accompany me." Will you paint?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, there is nothing wrong with it. Kemira, like Streif, sits in the child’s chair, her The knees are tightly close together, the two calves are crossed together, and the toes are gently pressed against the ground. Her attention quickly shifted from the children's pictures to Streif. Her colleagues and predecessors were not only watching the children's work, but also painting themselves, using charcoal and setting on cork board. A piece of paper, he moved the charcoal very fast, and the amplitude is very small, from the direction of Kemira, can only barely recognize that it is a dense deciduous tree, may be a fragrant, but It may also be a cypress tree that has not been built. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look at the children," Streif said. "Also let the children look at you." He handed over the same pen and paper, and Camilla took it. She poked the charcoal in shallow corn. On the yellow paper, the evening wind mixed with the scent of hibiscus tree blew in from the open window and blew it on her face. The naive paintings of the brushwork were blown up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am the daughter of Kaishengguo, his eldest daughter, the first child."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Straef nodded, he didn't stop his work, maybe not very polite, but at this time, a casual, careless attitude is much better than a focused gaze or a fascinating listener, though He is really interested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My mother is a descendant of Estonian immigrants, a model, my birth was an accident, so my father and my mother have a short period of about a year or so Marriage - For me, Kaishengguo insisted that his daughter could not be an illegitimate daughter of an uncle. They signed a very harsh treaty before marriage, and the mother got a lot of money, but she could not have any contact with me— - She can't talk to me, can't be with me, can't even admit that she is my mother. I was taken away when I was born, raised by the fiancee of Kaishengguo, my stepmother, she is a good person. Even if I am not her child, or more excessive, it is a shame for her, but she is still very good to me -"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you think she loves you?" Strath asked awkwardly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kemila hesitated: "I don't know," she said. "I don't know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"So what about you?" Streif said: "Do you love her?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time of hesitation is a little longer," Yes," Kemira finally said, "I think so."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, let's continue," said Steve, gentlely: "Let's talk casually, have you grown up in the seventh district? Before a certain moment, have you never thought that you are not a pure Chinese?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Kemira said: "I used to think that my stepmother was my biological mother, but then my brother and sister were born, they all have black hair and dark eyes. The ivory yellow skin, from them, I can't see a little bit similar to me. Just at that time, I went to school, the teacher told me that people will not give birth to a white skin, Hemp colored hair and green eyes of a child, whether they are praying to Buddha or Jesus, this is not possible "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;"Are you angry?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Kemira said: "I smashed all the mirrors in the house. I think that was my time. The performance was very bad. Kaisheng Guo was blamed for me. I had a fever. I couldn’t go to school again for a whole month. In the drowsiness, I heard someone mention my biological mother. They said, 'There is a kind of "," she said in Chinese: "I mean, I have inherited the bad part of the birth of a mother."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Street in the eyes of Streif Some sympathy: "Not like this, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In order to deny this, I have worked hard for fifteen years." Kemira said: "I It’s better than anyone, no matter what, grades, clothing, manners, poetry, calligraphy and painting... but they still say 'the foreigner’s.'<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "There is no denying," said Streif. "There are always things in the world that are difficult to change. Then what?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My original name is Kai Yongan," Kemira did not directly answer: "Kai Jiayong's generation, my sister is called Kai Yongle, my brother is called Kai Yongping." She said, and then re-use this in English. The three names are explained again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your father still loves you very much," said Streif. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Kemira said: "I don't want to see him sad, and more, I can't let go - a lot of things, if I abandoned them, which is equivalent to killing myself twenty years ago."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But this does not prevent you from making a small change." Camilla sneered and smiled. "Just for convenience, especially after entering college, I don't want to explain over and over again why I use a Chinese name." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your father and family obviously tolerate your little tricks, then there should be something else," said Streif: "For example, a command Mr. Kai Shengguo’s "good friend" who is still in his arms?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My boyfriend." Kemira admitted frankly: "My father is right." He hates it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Why?” said Streif. “If it is because of ethnicity, I am not a Chinese.” But the Kay family did not show a diswelcoming look. To be precise, for Streif, Their enthusiasm has been extraordinary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kimilla shrugged her shoulders, she looked very rare, and her movements were very stiff: "In fact, my father didn't want me to marry a Chinese." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steffef casts a questioning look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because of my appearance," Kemira said: "It’s a big heart for non-ethnic people. He thinks a husband and husband’s family with similar appearance. To make me happy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if her inside is a Chinese, Streif thinks, this is really a difficult choice, he wisely did not have this problem Go on: "So you chose a non-Chinese boyfriend? Is he a black?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, he is a native of Polynesia, and Like me, I have light hair and blue eyes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is taking drugs?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "There is absolutely no such thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Vulgar ignorance?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He graduated At Cornell University's College of Veterinary Medicine, the school is a private research university in Ithaca. I think you have heard of the famous Ivy League members."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"He doesn't love you enough...no no "Stelef self-denied: "I believe that you are deeply in love with each other. What is the problem?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is an animal protection Member of the association, that association... Well, I think, he is a bit extreme--in short, I didn’t expect things to go so badly at first—I took him to see my father, mother, brothers and sisters. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And they are entertaining." Streiff rubbed his chin with the tip of a charcoal wrapped in a small piece of cloth: "He went to the table." Splashing paint?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
