			<div id="content"><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least one dozen Mori fell into the reception hall of Ariau, and their body weight of up to half a ton successfully hit two tourists, their screams Mixed with the screams of others. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gangs are driven away from the periphery, and the public servants who are in extreme violent and frantic state will certainly not be tolerant of the additional obstacles. A tourist who was only pressed against his legs swung his arms and struggled to try to climb out. A male gong fell off the scorpion. It was as fast, soft and light as the current flowing onto the hapless body. And then tighten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One second, two seconds, three seconds... People heard the sound of a small squeak as the birds took off. After a while, they realized that it was human. Skeletons and muscles are fragmented and twisted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wrath of Mori used his power without hesitation. In one minute, it relaxed and tightened twice, successfully completing an unprecedented case. The least time-consuming and best-performing slimming course - according to Catherine, the guy who is obviously overweight has successfully reduced his size and surface area to one-third of the original. This is really a congratulatory thing. Although the coach’s request for compensation is too high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smell and color are equally weird liquids that flow from the curled ball-shaped spring-like forest to its prey, gradually increasing, and finally Even the polymer is a viscous water column, like a sponge filled with water being squeezed by a slow-strengthening hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe attracted by the bloody taste, the second, the third public servant broke out from the scorpion, they fell to the ground, Slightly raise your head and swim to the "fresh food" crowded in the corner of the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their action is to wake up the poor guys who have been stunned by the sudden situation, they are now in a warm house, nestled in On the soft sofa, you can enjoy a horror film or a national geographic record by chewing a large bag of potato chips. You are not drinking a fragrant coffee in the secret club library to read a vivid and vivid animal album; they are located in the same place. The reptiles at the top of the Amazon jungle food chain are face to face, three feet apart, and there isn't even a bulletproof glass often found in the zoo's snake zone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The visitors screamed again and shoved to the seemingly safe passage, a gorilla regardless of physique or mind The man slammed into Jack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack was hit on the wall, dizzy, his eyes blooming, and when he finally stood up with his own strength, he turned to his left hand Look - there is empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine ran away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hell!" Jack snarled and cursed, then turned and rushed outward. He had no intention of continuing to move to Catherine. The vicious foreboding was like a cone of ice. Like drilling in his head, Jack has never encountered this situation before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He dared to swear by his mother’s grave that death is imminent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please be careful, madam." Anthony Hopkins reaches out She grabbed a skinny female tourist and gently pushed her to the depths of the passage while she was not falling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is still a good texture today, good workmanship, but the style and color are very similar to Aria's work uniforms, which allows him to stay in the hall and the passage for a long time without causing anyone. The idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quietly watched the visitors coming in and out, watching the half of the roof crashing under the crush of the hustle and bustle, watching people panicked Running around, watching Catherine get rid of her partner by this "accident" and ran to Sasha hidden in a corner - Sasha extended her arm, and Catherine suddenly hugged her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very good, Anthony thought, everything went well, he was very happy to see that the sisters of "Catherine" could love Sasha as much as she did, and he hoped that Sasha could This woman's body got the part that had to be lost because of the early death of "Cather". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, if you want to make sure that this sweet little date will not be disturbed by any unpredictable accident, he still has to do something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Hopkins stepped out of the passage and quickly searched the bar in the corner of the reception hall, using his long arms and dexterous fingers from the counter A long spoon for mixing was taken out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He reversed the weight and determined that it was made of stainless steel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack found himself unable to leave here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the Mori is still lingering, but four public gongs have fallen off the mating ball and the reception hall has become their temporary playground. They happily swim around, curiously spit the letter, feeling everything around, and the other two Mori have already begun to eat to supplement the physical strength consumed during mating, and the ingredients are of course the two poorly picked. insect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even so, the mating ball is still incredibly large, and Jack estimates that there are at least eight to ten males and one big female. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They exude the smell of a rotten man who has been rotten for a week, tightly entwined with each other, and the block muscles slide slowly under the scales, like enough It is as flexible and tough as a steel cable that hoists tons of building materials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one dares to disturb such a group full of love and power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stared at them, carefully retreating, not finding an agile green shadow that was circling behind a charming golden twilight land orchid, quietly Walked behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hand rested on his shoulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please leave here, sir," Anthony Hopkins said softly. "It's dangerous."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A short burst of cold and pain came over the belt, and Jack's limbs softened with his tongue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony took Jack tightly and dragged him back. According to others, this is only a responsible staff member who helps the guests who are unable to move because of excessive panic to leave the danger zone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Hopkins brought Jack into a corridor with a mildly mild smell, and determined that no one rushed into the refuge here, he opened the end The door to the two rooms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room is small and full of white sheets and pillowcases to be washed, which look like clouds in the faint light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Hopkins figured out a small nest in the "cloud", he threw Jack inside, and then used his slenderness The pale fingers directly tore open his pants, the muscles and blood vessels inside the pants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood spewed out and was immediately absorbed by the good cotton fabric. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's quiet and safe," said Anthony. "Look at your luck." He lifted a sheet of paper and dumped them all over Jack. On the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony met the old friend when he left the corridor - at least Here is it - Aria's Guard Captain Joe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What the hell is this all about?" He screamed desperately, killing two tourists, no matter who they are, as the guard captain. He must have gotten out of the way, but if he didn't handle things well or make it worse before that, then the one waiting for him is probably the prison's electric chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think," Anthony followed him with a blissful walk to another tower: "A charismatic success and her passionate pursuit." ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the name of the devil cousin, swear, now Mori should not be estrus," Joe swayed, his eyes were devoid It’s pale: “This is not the place of mating that they like.” The surveillance system and guards on the outskirts of the tower were not damaged when they were destroyed. This should not have happened. At least it should not be like this. Unable to clean up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Hopkins sighs and agrees and regrets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned the long spoon in his hand, and a long spoonful of fork with a little dark red liquid was placed on top of a ripe purple berry. Mr. Anthony Hopkins hunted a green Brazilian raspberry twig. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He put it in his mouth, the sour taste of the thin flesh and the sweetness of the blood match seamlessly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack heard the sound of the door opening, then the footsteps that gradually approached Finally, the sheets on his face were pulled open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A priest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack remembered, Catherine said, this time there is a priest among the tourists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest looks a little surprised, he is not young, but not old, gray hair, blue eyes, black coat collar with a white hard collar, wearing The wide-brimmed hat that the clergy likes, a large silver cross on the chest, and the verse or other pattern on the cross may be inscribed. Jack doesn’t see it very clearly. After all, the light here is too dark, and he has already flowed a lot. blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He struggled to make a life-saving mouth, but even if he said nothing, the things the priest saw should be fully explained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
