			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like a girl’s roommate in a monastery who doesn’t take up the cork of Sasha. He carefully and subtly painted his picture. It is staggered and fixed on a cork board, snakes, frogs, owls... The biggest painting is a lion head monkey holding a small monkey, its sag is drooping like a used one. Golden silky long hair, its face is surrounded by a lion-like mane, and its tail is very similar to a lion. It is a newly discovered creature, but Sasha is no stranger to it. The man jumped from the tree and almost put it. The kidnapper he used as a little monkey was a lion head monkey, perhaps because the soft golden hair of Sasha was like the relationship of his child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My former roommate always complained that I couldn’t sleep because I was so stared at so many eyes." Sasha’s roommate said, "I don't understand why he is." Then think, the animals are very cute, and it is always my dream to sleep peacefully in the animal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Personal perception." Said, anyway, since he was a baby, he has been accustomed to the shining eyes in the dark and the various sounds of one after another. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he never thought that the animal was cute, even if he took care of him for six years, Mori Miri was difficult to associate with the adjective - cute It is often equal to the fragile painting, and as long as it can occupy a place in the cold nature, even a rabbit will inevitably have its own strong and cruel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to mention those living in the Amazon jungle, who are eating and eating every time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quinta’s mobility is strong, Besib and Sasha I visited three restaurants, five stalls, and two cafes, and I received an invitation from the ball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The invitation was very delicate, the cover was hollow, with a small dried flower, and the time and place were written on the pale yellow enamel page. Personnel and general process, note: dress, everyone must prepare a packaged small gift. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s ridiculous that the main body of the ball is actually welcoming Labor Day (the first Sunday in September). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is also a problem that can't be done," Quinta said. "Of course we can use the name of the newcomer. But this will be the welcome of the seniors. The dance has some unpleasant misunderstandings - how do you say it, when the two are inevitably compared, you win, they will be very upset, you lose, no, I don't want this Bad start, this will give me four years, or longer Manchester life, can not erase the shadow, maybe I will get depression because of this ... take medicine every day. Then because of too many classes I am forced to give up my studies... then I will be finished. I will definitely suffer for this life, be destitute, and finally I can only go to Manchester on the alumni day of the year to reach out to you - if you are willing to pity on the roommates." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha glanced at him, and the distance between depression and the black boy was like walking from the moon to the earth – or on foot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Will you attend?" Quinta asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are attending," Bessie Seshasa replied. He turned the invitation in his hand: "The question is other people? There is only one week for the New Week, and only two weeks for the class week. After three weeks, almost everyone has officially started classes. Do you think they will have this mood? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is because of the pressure from Manchester that someone wants to relax," Quinta said. “Can you please do something with your help?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Talk about it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Get some wine." Quinta said: "I will give money."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not twenty-one years old." Besib said In the Greater District where Manchester is located, it is forbidden for minors under the age of 21 to drink alcohol, to drink alcohol to minors and to provide alcohol to minors. Or know that minors drinking alcohol (including buying and owning alcoholic beverages) are crimes. When seniors want to drink, they will let the fourth-grade students who are over 21 years old buy it. After buying it, they will be drunk in the dormitory. But the new students who just entered Manchester want to play this trick is a bit difficult, they can not find a trusted adult (not everyone will, and willing to encourage minors to drink alcohol); second, even if they are willing to take risks It is also difficult to buy alcoholic beverages. Whether it's a supermarket that only offers beer, or a specialty store that can buy champagne, wine and brandy, whisky, the clerk has a pair of sharp eyes. They will carefully verify the identity documents of every customer who looks too young. As long as they catch a trace of it, you can only go out with a chilly “going out” – the fake documents they have collected. Can pile up a hill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Without the wine, the dance will lose a lot of color." Quinta said with a frowning face: "Do you count your love?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Beer, fruit wine, blended wine, champagne," Besib said: "Not higher than twelve degrees."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" If you like," Quinta said, "Okay." He didn't want his first dance to end up being sent to the hospital as an alcoholic poisoner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
