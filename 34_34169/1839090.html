			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last rays of the sun are red and bloody, and every place that it shines seems to be burning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ch-53 Large-capacity helicopters took off from the city of Manaus, sitting inside six adult men, some of them dressed neatly, calm, wrist watch And the elegant perfume tastes even if you don't look at the signs, you can know that they are worth a lot of money; some are awkward, wrinkled, stinking; some are just simple pullovers and jeans, holding arms Without a word, it looks like a very honest hydropower repairman or truck driver, but even if you close your eyes and hold your nose, you can feel that they are absolutely not good; only one of them looks better. Playing with it - the first time he followed the "institution" action group, his excited eyes glowed, the two fingers' slender hands repeatedly rubbed between the knees, and the electric spark popped out from his light brown skin from time to time. It screamed and jumped high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Look at your hand, or I will cut it down before it causes any disaster." The man next door jumped on a small Mars. After getting into his nose, he was finally impatient. He snorted and gave a threat while wiping a small but sharp axe with a piece of fur that he didn't know, so that the cold light reflected from it would face the young boy's face. Planing out - like making some powerful circumstantial evidence for your own words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, don't be too nervous, Martin." Another man who can be said to have a sharp contrast with the former is politely swearing: "Bard Just want to calm you down. You see, your ability is very useful, but it is also very dangerous - we are now in a helicopter, and a little electric spark can cause a short circuit in the electrical appliance," he said: "We don't have Superman who can lift a plane, Ha. Ha. Ha..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one takes care of him except the new guy. The man didn't seem to think that he was quiet and quietly alone for a while, he opened the small suitcase he carried with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The neatly arranged in the small black suitcase is a variety of calming and anesthetic agents - the stability of the general patient (diazepam), commonly used in surgery Nucardine, lidocaine, ether and chloroform, chlorpromazine for psychotic patients, barbiturate and its derivatives, the drug of euthanasia, diazepam, morphine and hailoyuin. There are also a variety of tools that make these drugs work best – hollow needles, syringes, subcutaneous injection darts, and more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man is skilled at these distressing little things, pours various drugs into them, adjusts their bodies to ensure the heads, and waits for them to do the same. He began to play around with four or five sparkling darts that spit in and spit out like his lizard's tongue. He imagined how he could hide in the hunting operation, quietly waiting, sneaking, searching, and finding out how to hit the target after being chased by other people to the path of panic and panic, and then how to Prey "moving away - if he can bring back the live "ghoul" single, he can get an extra bonus from the agency in addition to the rewards set by the "food" and "food" relatives. Maybe finish this Tickets can safely pass through the rest of his life, and no longer have to deal with these damn monsters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For "ghoul", he doesn't feel terrible, yeah, he ate, this kind of thing was sensational ten years ago, Now, maybe the Christmas pie sent by your next neighbor has the nose or ears of his wife's mother. Oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ... a few people? It is not clear, no more than two dozens anyway. If it is placed today, he will not be able to list the "institution". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is this called? Is it famous early? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought of the dead Mary, nicknamed "anaesthetist", he is far less than a stupid little girl in the preparation of drugs, he once proposed and She partnered, but she refused. She liked the little Queens in the world except for a beautiful empty skin.) She is still too young, young and does not know what a real man looks like. Now it’s good, she not only failed to keep the little bastard, but also lost her life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin spread his hands and let the currents like the blue snakes dissipate. He was quite reluctant, but he also knew that the predecessors were right. He has to get rid of this too naive, stupid habit. He listened to the blades of the helicopter rolling in the air, the fuselage trembled in the wind, and the faint light at dusk was on the face of the action team members. They all looked very strong, calm and innocent. No. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, wiping their weapons to kill time or calm their minds - in addition to the previous axe and darts, Martin also saw a short The mace, consisting of a nailed steel ball, a sharp blade, a two-foot handle, and a dagger made of reinforced polycarbonate. The sheath is protected, and the scabbard is folded over. It is the handle of the scabbard. The airport can't detect it. There are other shiny, cold things. It is difficult for the boys to contact them so much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the most is the gun, even those who like to use cold weapons have to take the guns for the unexpected, they basically use McGonnon The bullet's large revolver or military automatic pistol is full of bullets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin also has, he learned how to use a gun in the organization, and he used to go hunting, but he still has to be shocked when he thinks about shooting at a person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said," he stunned the man across the street with a slight uneasiness. He was the head of the action: "We will have the need to shoot." "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you like," the head replied: "You can look at the lives of others more than your own life, but," he looked A little boy: "I suggest that you still use this rare compassion on your companions, at least we will say thank you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin's blush He licked his lips: "I just want to know if we kill someone..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought you already knew we were not going At the Christmas dinner."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just want to know if I will find us trouble!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The head sighed in the heart, if this little guy is not Jack’s younger brother, will he not let this one? 舻睦圩讣 胱 胱 约 旱 旱 旱 旱 旱 旱 橹 橹 橹 橹 橹 橹 橹 橹??vent芸 那 那 那 兀 兀 兀 兀 兀 兀 兀 兀 兀 兀 兀 姑 姑 姑 姑 姑 姑 姑 姑 卸 卸 卸 卸 卸 卸 卸 卸 卸 氖 氖 氖 氖 氖 氖 氖 氖 氖 氖 氖 氖 氖 氖 氖? I am glad to hear that another dregs have been cleared out of this already bad world. Jack has not said to you, 'Institution' is related to the above, as long as we don't make it too bad, the above nature will be based on national security as an excuse. Let local law enforcement agencies stop investigating the matter. Even if one or two stubborn guys are determined to pursue it, he will only get a lot of evidence that is good for us, including proof of absence and anything else."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But," he paused a little: "You have to keep in mind that we are going to hunt for prey, not to be a prey!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin instigated his lips. He obviously didn't understand the warning with double meaning, but it was nothing. Originally, this sentence was not meant to be heard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a time, the cabin was quiet and no one spoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How far are we from Ariau?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head is watching the slave The red light shining through the window glass, it stands to reason, as time goes by, it should be weaker and weaker until nothing, but in fact, as the helicopter moves at full speed, it is getting brighter and brighter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood up and walked into the cockpit, looking down at the cabin door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What he saw made him sharply open his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God," he gasped and shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole Ariawu is burning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody knows how the fire burned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 268 tree-top rooms, suites and tree houses 10-20 meters above the rainforest floor, and the 8 km long trestle connecting them are all wooden But no one has ever thought that there will be a big fire here - the whole Ariawu is almost surrounded by the Amazon River, which will be immersed in the rainy season, even in the dry season, the Amazon River continues to flow, and The trees growing on the river often have deep roots and draw water from the soil below a few meters, so they will not wither and fall out in the dry season like the trees in other places. Instead, they will become more moisturized because of the sufficient light. With the parasitic and epiphytic plants that cover the sky, it has never been possible to predict the rainstorms of rainfall and time. The humidity in the rainforest is amazing, and the water droplets that gradually gather on the leaves are falling like the mature fruits. At the time, you want to smoke a cigarette but you will find yourself unable to match the match. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame rises from the bottom of the tower, and the water that is less than a foot away does not have a little hindrance to its germination and growth. Like the vines after the rain, they climbed faster, became longer, thicker, extended tentacles, and drilled into the cracked windows and walls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ariawu has perfect alarm and fire protection facilities, but unfortunately, these delicate fire extinguishing systems and devices can only deal with occasional lost cigarettes or have not been extinguished. The small accident caused by the bonfire, bursting into the room, jumping or throwing into the room, with a four- or five-foot-high fire snake and unconsciously infiltrating between the gap between the floor and the threshold. The smog that fills the entire floor in a moment like a thick gray carpet can't make much difference. Fortunately, their spread on the plane is not so fast, people can panic out of the green shelter that is no longer reliable. Everyone hopes to get a little help, but finds that other towers are surrounded by flames and the same path as the plank road. In the smoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the smarter people find that the screaming flames and the large gray smoke may not be the most dangerous thing - they come out The evil consequences are desperate at the top - in order to avoid the rivers rising from the rainy season and to guard against the beasts in the forest, each room in Ariaou is about 8 meters from the ground, not supporting the steel bars or cement. In order to highlight the concept of living in accordance with nature and protecting the ecology, their builders used wooden structures to support these barrel-shaped houses in the woods according to local conditions and local methods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
