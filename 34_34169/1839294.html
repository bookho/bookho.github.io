			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This small, not so remote, but less striking cottage has a conical loft like any house of the same type Perhaps because the living population has only three relationships, the attic is idle, empty, dark, dusty, spider webs everywhere, although it can be seen that the owner tried very hard to clean it up at the beginning. - Carton and carton, film, plastic foam, and nylon bags used to bundle new furniture are folded and collected, stacked neatly in the corner; white, or old white sheets that were once white On the top of the box and the crock – Hopkins carefully opened the sheets, and the dust rolled down like a meringue on Danish bread. Next to a crock, he found one. Old sofas - based on the "simple" concept and requirements, the believers of the sects always like to use everything until they can no longer be used. This sofa is the same, it is stripped of the bright cover, rough The cloth was exposed to a little dim light that came in through the small window of the black scorpion. From the cracked gap, it can be seen that the spring that lost its strength is swelling in the messy mess of the yellow-colored sponge and the ignorant. Unknown textiles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But these don’t mean that it has been completely abandoned by the owner. Hopkins found new repairs on the wooden feet and armrests, maybe In a few days, there will be a hardworking housewife carrying a sewing box or a hoe to climb a small staircase that is almost seventy degrees steep with the ground. The intruder lifts the sheets, shakes it, turns it over and covers the sofa. Above, then move it to a position so that it stands firmly under the only small window. He encountered extremely subtle obstacles when he opened the window - the window was locked, the hinge was rusted because it was not used for a long time and the material was poor - the window was opened with fresh air of grassy atmosphere You can't wait to enter. The rain stopped, the clouds sank, and the clear moonlight formed a strangely shaped square on the sofa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temporary seat that was severely collapsed made Big Hopkins have to straighten his legs to stretch his body, and the clean fingers crossed. Stacked on the abdomen, the ghoul slowly breathes at a frequency of fifteen times a minute, and the temperature of the abdomen is gradually transmitted to the palm through the washed linen shirt - he moves his neck and unlocks a button. The owner is a short, strong man, and the finished shirt must be modified to make him comfortable. Anthony Hopkins was tall and thin – the slender fingers paused for a while on the neck, and the gray-haired heron's feathery hair was a little damp, and the doctor had never liked the artificial wind. The residual water vapor infiltrated the sheets on the headrest, creating a large shadow there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He closed his eyes and entered his memory palace in a matter of seconds. He walked along the long, steep passage and climbed the stairs that hovered like a goose to see the door. The door was unusually quiet, as if nothing existed, the ghoul stopped in front of the door for a while, the reddish brown eyes became very bright, then he turned and held another door Handle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second door is very close to the door that is banned from the "beast". The style was exactly the same, and what surprised his father was that the door was locked today - he knocked on the door. Although the door came over, although it could not be said to be gentle, but it was not a nervous atmosphere, the door was still closed, and this was the first time. Sasha Hopkins rejected Anthony Hopkins’ visit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is open. Several people stood there against the light, and the one headed was tall and thin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha looked up. Before that, he was working on the drawer on the walnut desk – the desk that was born more than half a century ago usually had a hidden secret organ that kept the precious jewels for the priests and nobles. And the important documents, he didn't want to find something in it, but it was filled with things - it was a small treasure house, and there are some details that we won't repeat here, for five hundred years. The tribute and accumulation, even if it is impossible to compare with the real holy place - the most important, where the wealth belongs to a country, and the wealth here belongs to only one surname, or even one person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello.Strang Jacob, rightly, the Stefans now stand at the door, and every place is carefully watched. Clearly clear - his savior, his Messiah. Although his brother, Heyman Stronger, made him angry and dissatisfied, he had to admit that the Messiah should be like this - pure, brilliant, aromatic, sacred... ...unique, and, belong to them, his. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But now is not the time, he said to himself, the fruit is not yet mature, its fruit is still firmly connected to the sin tree, forcibly pulled拽 will only make it irreparable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am sorry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boy closed the drawer, bypassed the desk, and forwarded After two steps, standing under the copper lamp hanging from the center of the high roof, the sleek luminaire underneath is completely enclosed, although it uses a light bulb inside, the light is from the bowl. The lamp holder was projected in all directions, which allowed Sasha Hopkins's face to be hidden under the shallow shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“For everything that has been done so far,” said Stefan: “Although Hayman’s actions are not from my wishes.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter," Sasha said indifferently and softly: "So, what's next?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will do my best to make up," Everyone said: "Fortunately, there have been no irreparable mistakes for the time being - the game is over. According to the original arrangement, your team members will receive the best treatment. Others can leave at any time and return to Grande. , or somewhere else."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Include me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Include you, "Stefan said: "And your friend, your father, any one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bishb. Bisangdi?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is very good," said Stefan. From the surface, he seems to have no scorn: "You can go and see him first."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slightly unexpected, Besib. Bissau’s situation is not too bad, he was also placed in a room There is no furniture and decoration. The roof, walls and floors are painted with black and red paints and exorcism spells and graphics. The air is filled with the smell of roses and blood that are already very familiar with the sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most delightful thing about Sasha is that Besib has returned to his original appearance, one person, one boy, no more than one arm and no more Legs, naked, naked body, except for bruises and minor bleeding, there is no trace of fear and anxiety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is asleep, his chest is undulating and regular. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stefan made a gesture, a black priest walked up, poured a potion into the mouth of Besib, and then retired, after a few seconds Bell, Besib opened his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good guy," he said hoarsely. "This time is really exciting, isn't it, Sasha?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you stand up?" Sasha said: "Walk first, or come with me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishb quickly rubbed his eyes, he was lazy Sit up and take a look at the limbs, then the fingers and toes: "I am going with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest brought a suit - one A black robes, no, no socks and shoes, no vests or shirts, and Besib took it over himself and snorted without notice. As he walked around the hallway, he touched Sasha's arm with a bad intention: "How? I mean... Dear, for a few years, I haven't been so cool below." He looked at the sprinkles. Sand - the place below the waist, the style of the robes of Sasha is very similar to him, but there is a fine and extravagant that cannot be said. In addition, the color is white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha said nothing, he just rudely took over his friend, Besib is not as good as he showed, he Almost failing to make some rebellious resistance, he can really go, but he can only go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are going there?" asked Besib. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go to see my father, ah, the one on the ground," said Stefan, who walked in front of him, and said with a sigh of relief: "Sage , Jared Stronge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerrid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s not surprising that they are really stunned. Life is like a sage, Jared, who can be extinguished at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s only two or three days before the last meeting, but Jared seems to have passed the last part of his life, deep purple With the golden account, the face and body exposed in the white quilt can only be reminiscent of a deformed walnut - dry, blackened walnut, his blood is drained, if breathing No, the countless tubes stick out from the old paper-like skin and connect them to one after another. The strange thing is that they don’t see the doctor, only see a stiff, pale, shrinking Heman, who would receive God's call earlier than his father, Strongman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More strangely, he was indifferent when he saw Stefan, his brother, and once Harvey. When Sasha recovered his normal look, he moved his body and seemed to want to say something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
