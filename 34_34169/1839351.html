			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha and Besib returned to Grande with a leather box of books and homework. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the second semester of the ninth grade, Sasha and Besib are the so-called "gifted classes" students. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this class, most of them are the leaders who have revealed their talents and talents since the age of ten, that is, from the fourth and fifth grades, They were brought together into “higher classes” to receive better, deeper and more comprehensive education – members of the school committee declared that it was a kind of protection and conscientiousness for children with extraordinary intelligence – cleverly let There is nothing to say, these children are treated as carefully as the exotic flowers in the park greenhouse, but in the same way, it is like the flowers that are rotted and rotten will be removed from the greenhouse. If any child appears to be unable to keep up with the curriculum. In this case, the class teacher will immediately report to the school committee. Someone who is responsible for this work will discuss with the parents the “future education situation”, that is, euphemistically inform them that their children will be transferred to the class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the parents express anger or disagree, the school will not insist, but the teachers in the higher class will not be unable to concentrate because of a child’s poor memory or It's hard to understand what he said and slow down the progress of the teaching – almost all parents will choose to compromise when the child is suffering for their own studies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Children who can withstand this tempering need to go through a test before they reach the ninth grade to make sure they will finish the four grades step by step in the future. Then, enter the “Gifts” class that needs to complete four grades in two years, and then study in the college preparatory class for the remaining two years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before entering the college preparatory class, there is also a unified test, each school's requirements are different, but Grande's request is all a (5 points) 4.0), those who can get this score can enter the college preparatory class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha Hopkins wants to get this score very easily, but Besib. Bissau is a little harder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, his desire to enter the college preparatory class may not be difficult, and Grande’s team played a few friendly matches with the two schools after the league. Only lost one game. Or because there is no relationship with Sangdi. The coach worried that continuous combat would affect his physical strength and knees. He loved this powerful, brave and agile little monster. As a full running back, his physical strength, endurance and reaction can make professional rugby players feel Hey - but what he admires most is the fierce momentum and perseverance of Besib, who can remain unchanged from appearance to exit. He is the most sophisticated steel, sharp, courageous, and tough. He can become a wide sword, open the enemy's most solid wall, and become a giant shield to provide the most reliable protection for his comrades. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, Besib. Bisangdi is not a small puppet with only muscle but no brain. The coach noticed that the whole team. In addition to the captain, he is the fastest and most accurate person to understand the tactical intentions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quarterback of the Grande School team, who is also their captain, is already a 12th grader and his performance is not satisfactory. There are still several good universities that have thrown olive branches to him. Grande is on the one hand, and his captain identity is another. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coach wants to make Besib. Bissau a new quarterback and captain, but he has to take into account the ideas of other players and the school board. Or come to a public test? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of his term is only two years left, the coach must be a little upset, if the team he leads can be this year, or next year. In the big league to get a better ranking, Grand's school board will re-sign a long-term contract with him, so he and his wife can buy in the town of Grande. A house, he can also be replaced by a new car, his daughter is studying at the Vistula Women's Private School, tuition ... is not easy for an ordinary working family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went to the window. Open the curtains and see that the two boys are walking through the wide lawn and heading for the dormitory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of them is his unforgettable Besib. Bisangdi is thinner than two months ago, but the boys in this period will be abrupt because of the body. Pulling up and looking a bit thin and thin - the coach wants him not to be more than six feet seven inches. A full running back can grow up to seven feet five inches (2.2 meters), but for a quarterback, this height can make him awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also thought that an application should be made to the school board, and the food after the training should be biased towards those foods with high protein content, for example, rabbit meat. , beef and chicken breasts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every rugby player has a beautiful muscle that is dazzling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to welcome the students, the trees and lawns on the Grand campus have been pruned, sprinkled with water, and can smell a little bit of thorns wherever they go. The scent of the nose is said to be good for human hippocampus and almond protrusions that control emotions and memories—no, no, it is the amygdala and hippocampus, and Besib corrects it in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A boy stood in the woods and waved at them. It was Charlie. There were several boys standing beside him, the ones who survived the catastrophe in the monastery. Before seeing Besib and Sasha, they were talking happily, and Charlie still had a book in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They also waved to Charlie, but did not go over, Charlie and the children were not "gifted classes", Boa. Douglas narrow The stingy vision is not enough to include them in the first place, but if they get along with Sasha and Besib, it is hard to say. Sasha and Besib can fight against and even counter Boa. Compared with them, it is better to say that it is better for ordinary teenagers to stay away from the forces behind them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the door of the dormitory, they met Avery, a boy who was once a fat boy who was also suffering from "developmental weight loss", perhaps because How to get used to the new height relationship, his back is a little camel, he is facing them, standing in the wide foyer and a little boy with brown freckles on his nose and cheeks, looking very excited and excited. Unconsciously blocking the way to the corridors and stairs. The short boy saw them in Sasha, so he smashed Avery and reminded him to let him go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avery looked back, and there was a happy blush on his face, a thin layer of sweat on his forehead, and then saw Sasha and Besib. At the time, he was taken aback, one foot clung to the other, and the statue on the side of the corridor did not fall. But everything he had in his hand fell all over the floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately groaned and panicked, and Bishop picked up a photo that just fell on his shoe. The photo had a row in the lower right corner. The bellows signature, signed with a pink highlighter. In the photo, there are four young people, three men and one woman, with exaggerated hairstyles and beautiful makeup. It is worth seeing that the upper body of a woman who is only about twenty years old is naked - although two-thirds of the huge chest is The pattern is covered by the tattoos of the sinister Minotaurs who eat the boys and girls, but it is still very attractive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This will be collected." Besib regrets: "There will be credits."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's Avery's sister," said the short boy, perhaps he just wanted to fight for his friend - in Grande, carrying and spreading ** are not allowed. He didn't know if the two men would tell the story: "She will be a star, like that."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha took photos from Besib's fingers and gave it to Avery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't make trouble," he said to Besib. "It's beautiful, very unique." He said to Avery: "You have a good sister. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Thank you." Avery criticized that he would hide from Besib in the locker room, not to watch swimming training and competitions. He didn't know how to face the two men - he had the opportunity to be friends with them, but he was finally screwed up by himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beip helped them open the door. He came to school two days earlier than Sasha and Besib, cleaning up and sorting out the bathroom shared by the three people. living room. The curtains are clean, the floor is bright, the air is filled with the smell of fresheners, the low table is set with bagels, coffee and books, and it seems that he has not wasted waiting time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is for your wife." Besib gave him a small velvet box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beip opens. Inside the small box is a diamond ring. The diamond is only about 1.5 carats, but the color is good. It is like holding a small star in your hand. "Yixi will be happy." He said with a smile: "She always wanted a diamond ring like this." He calmly put the small box into his jeans bag and went back to the low table to continue reading his book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t say thank you, and his own people on Poseidon Island didn’t need to say thank you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn’t see Boa in the process of crossing the entire campus and dormitory. Douglas made both Sasha and Besib feel relaxed, they used it in turn. The bathroom, smashed the white linen on the bed and writing desk, chairs and other furniture, stuffed the dirty clothes into the laundry basket and prepared to take it to the laundry room. They had already reported it to the Dean's Office. But Besib will go to the coach once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have training?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know," Besib said. While holding the laundry basket with dirty clothes under his arm: "Today is the first day, but I think our coach has become more and more nervous recently."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Your quarterback is already a 12th grader," Sasha said. "He doesn't have much time to use."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
