			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a bang, Mary Kent’s beautiful t-home bridge hit the border of the garage door, and the white painted surface immediately showed cracks and pits. She looked in from the rearview mirror, and was both annoyed and tired. The car moved forward a few feet. She clenched the steering wheel, adjusted the direction little by little, and looked down again and again— Make sure that the left and right feet are stepping on the brake pedal, the forward pedal or the reverse pedal. The vehicle salesman told her that the car is equipped with an extremely superior, superior performance and uniquely designed gear transmission system that works “just like a planet moving around the sun!” But so far, Mary Kent I’ve never felt this before – if you have to say that this car has something that would remind her of the stars of the universe, it’s probably only its elusive situation and the huge but boneless frame, and it’s known You can drive any kind of road, but you need to endure the ubiquitous bumps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This car is her husband Robert Kent. Originally, Mary also had her own car, but it had a problem three months ago; Kent’s new location is in the Washington, DC area, thousands of miles away. The company arranged a dormitory for him. He took the subway home once a month—no need for a car, so it’s logical that Mary took over the beautiful appearance. Waste, she did not consider buying another car, but now she is pregnant and resting at home, Kent has just changed her job, and the deposit at home has been removed from the estate tax by a zero. All kinds of conditions forced them to Some places make sacrifices, and the car is good on a flat road anyway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The garage door rumbling in front of the front window. The garage suddenly fell into a darkness, and the light-sensing light was on. Mary was glad that the impact had not affected the garage door, although it was a bit of a delay during the descent - otherwise the maintenance cost was an extra expense, she looked from the rear view. Looking at the child in the back seat in the mirror, he rubbed his head: "Okay, dear, get off," she said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie and Dolores quickly opened the seat belt, picked up their bags, and opened the door and jumped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dolores ran out of the garage without going back, and Mary would hear her footsteps on the left, that is, the kitchen. The floor of the hallway creaked. "No direct drinking of ice water, no ice cream," Mary said from the window and shouted: "Milk does not work." But she knows that this is mostly useless. Every time she had to go to the kitchen to pick up the little trickster. The problem is that she has been pregnant for 27 weeks. The stomach has become very prominent, her legs and feet are swollen, and every time she walks, she feels like stepping on the mud pit. In one step, one step is more important than one step, and finally it can sink her to make her difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary got out of the car, Anne didn’t leave, she happened to go around Mary and closed the door, and Mary comfortably touched the little girl’s head. Under the light and yellow tinge of the sensor light, Anne saw her lips move slightly twice, but after all, she said nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary took Dolores out of the fridge, Annie stayed in the kitchen, and today Mary’s situation is not very good, but she still has to drive to school to get more Lorez... Of course, there is also myself, so today she cooks dinner, which is not bad. Mary’s food is getting worse, not half-baked or misplaced. The little girl took the vegetables out of the refrigerator. , meat, and butter and cheese, an hour later she went upstairs to call Dolores and Mary, Dolores came down very quickly, she was hungry, but Mary had fallen asleep in bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you eating today?" The porcelain plate was swayed by Dolores's fork, and the two feet swayed uncomfortably under the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Eggplant meat, roast chicken wings, and corn soup. Honey apple pie"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hate vegetable juice." Dolores towards a cup of dark green The juice is frowning, the tongue is stretched out, and the vomiting is done. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's not for you," said Annie. "It's for Mary. Vegetable juice is good for pregnant women."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dolores shrugged his shoulders, she was attracted by the eggplant, this is a very interesting dish from the outside - Anne dig the eggplant, cut onion Stir-fry, garlic cloves, tomatoes, bell peppers and parsley, then put in the seasoning, stuffed with cheese and croutons into the eggplant shell, roast it in the oven, and the golden-colored cheese melts, giving off a seductive sweet aroma. Lores put the fork into the depths of the eggplant and looked through the things inside. "What is this?" she asked, looking suspiciously at the little white thing on the white bright fork: "Looks like a mouse."屎."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't be stupid, it's spice, Mary's appetite is not good, I use this to give her an appetite."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know so much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you are willing to play with the boys You can understand when you read the book."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You always love to lose your appetite at this time, Anne Mother."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie's mother has a face: "There is no chicken wings when you talk."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;;;;&nbsp; The next morning, Mary’s situation got worse. She hesitated whether she was going to the hospital, but eventually she went to the medicine box and found some medicine. After half an hour, she announced that she was much better, but Finally, breakfast was made by Annie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While waiting for the school bus, Dolores has been complaining that Anne’s breakfast today is meager, and she thinks she might spit out on the school bus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie felt a headache, but fortunately the school bus came before she could not continue to endure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orange-colored square box-type car slowly stopped, the driver got off the bus, pulled the red stop sign on the side of the body, and suddenly the dragon and the tiger Dolores got up and pushed Annie and the other children, as in the past, the first one rushed into the car... She originally wanted to sit on her old seat – the single position in the first row, but Changed my mind when I saw a golden brown soft hair. After Anne and the other children came one after another, they were surprised to find that Dolores, who had never been willing to huddle with others, and a newcomer they had never met before sat together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe Anne wants to be excluded, because this new child is Sasha, a fresh-born newborn, his father is a new teacher of St. Thomas, they are Yesterday I visited the entire campus. Anne was the guide of Sasha, and Dolores... was visited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dolores gave up his throne, but other children did not dare to sit up like this, they have all witnessed a fifth grade student being Dolo Les squatted down and slammed into a cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie was not seated, she walked over and held her hands between the two backs: "Your position is there, Dolores, you never like and Let others sit together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Dolores showed a bad smile: "But I know you want to sit with him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie licked her lips, her The eyebrows are twisted together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dolores smiled happier. She lifted a foot and stepped on the back of the chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's put down your feet," Annie said coldly. "And there is a seat belt." She glanced at Sasha and said good morning. Turned to sit in the original position of Dolores. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Children, and the drivers who didn’t know when they came up, looked at them three smiles. Before starting the school bus, the 40-year-old female driver also Sasha blinked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha looked out the window and he had nothing to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is quiet in the carriage, but Dolores does not seem to be ready to let go of this new boy. She takes the bag off and stuffs herself and the two. Between the armrests of the seat, and then tilt the body as far as possible, it seems that I want to squeeze the sand into the corner of the seat, so she even twisted her legs and upper body to a very uncomfortable angle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha really doesn’t know if this little girl should be reminded that the seat of the school bus can accommodate two physically strong adults... the paradox is only two The child who is up and down, and has a seat belt in a fixed position, how hard she can work, and no way to occupy the entire seat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dolores worked hard for at least five minutes, and after discovering that her attempt was hard to succeed, she kicked an annoyed kick toward the front back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why are you going to take the school bus?" She squinted at the boy with a beautiful face. He looked like an adult and looked at her, not panicking. Not angry: "Why don't you let your father send you? His job search failed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha looked at her, "No," he Patiently replied: "The teacher wants to arrive in advance, I want you to know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dolores wrinkled his nose and waved his right hand as if to drive away A fart just in front of her. "I certainly know, but he can let you get there early, you can stay in his office."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "Unruly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dolores stared at Sasha for a while like an alien - he was sincere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She really started to hate this guy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary found herself soiling the sheets again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the three months of pregnancy, she will always have abdominal pain in the morning, not long, but will leave a dark brown stain, but the doctor said it is The normal phenomenon during pregnancy, only the big bleeding needs attention, but she did not have this problem when she was in Puerto Dolores. She has been worried a bit. She once thought about changing one, but this doctor is from the insurance company. The location of the detailed list of obstetricians and gynecologists and hospitals, if you replace it, you need to go to the insurance company to do a formality, which is not a small trouble for her pregnant, the result has been dragged to the present. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
