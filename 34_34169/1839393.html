			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I never knew that the snail was about to become extinct..." Besib murmured, he caught a snail that was still a blue-grey shell. Put it in front of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past few days, Richard has been painting snails. He has also led a large number of people who are good at or not good at painting. Manchester is full of colorful software. biological. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not yet...no, not," Richard said bluntly: "As long as it rains, they... will be thousands of places... ...outs appear on walls, leaves and on the ground, they are not rare, and they are numerous, but you can't think that such a life is not worth cherishing because of it... too ordinary and flooding - there are many human beings, big Some of them are ordinary people. As one of them, I also hope that... some people are willing to paint my shell."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not Sib noticed that when Richard talked about snails, he used humans instead of animals. He hoped that this was not an extreme animal protectionist, especially his side and each other had a non-vegetarian In case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The problem is that human beings have no enemies." Besib said that he was going to pinch a snail carrying a big shark and dipped his two fingers: "You Do you think there will be aliens attacking the earth?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard’s mouth is very powerful, and for a moment, Besib thought he would Laughing loudly: "Oh," he said. "The enemy of mankind - only humans, there will be nothing else." Then he put down the snail painted as a multicolored candy and began to pack up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hopkins is not with you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Some lessons he and I are Not the same," Besib moved his foot and gave Richard a pass, lest he step on the slow-moving snails: "What about you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"I...is on."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh." Besib understood: "If possible." He said regretfully: "I also I want to take this course. Is it the history of art evolution?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“No,” Richard said, “how to make yourself happy.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So you are here to add clothes to the snails?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Warnings - the Chinese have a good saying, save lives, and win the seven-level float - Futuo is the meaning of the pagoda. It is said that it can remove evil and evil. It attracts light... Although most people think that the little things like snails are not worthy of being compared with themselves, I think that I can at least do what I can. He piled up a small mound."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at Besib, his tiny eyes flashed like waiting for his answer, but a rude The bark interrupted their conversation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are about ten steps from them. A senior boy with a slap in the face was angering the two girls, and Besib stared at their faces and found that they were not the ones they knew. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishb’s excellent vision quickly caught the cause of their quarrel – a colorful snail was crushed, and the sparkling orange and yellow shards were mixed. The transparent mucus blended in the gap between the gray bricks and they listened for a while. The case is very simple. The boy who insisted on Hu was not seen. He held a lot of books and was tall; the girls with the oily faces on both faces and hair insisted that he was deliberate because he had more than once I laughed at this boring behavior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two girls are probably second-year or third-grade students. When they notice that Besib is also watching them, they are no longer so impetuous. - Not every girl has the courage and courage to become a fierce violent lion in front of someone she likes, except for Chiz, who remembered the first meeting before. It is really impressive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since one party is dying, the other party does not have to insist on it, and he is still an older man. The snail's injurer pouted and hurriedly held the book and walked away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you." One of the girls said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't help anything," Besib said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can stand there." The second girl said that she was as stupid as possible to control herself not to laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besb ​​and Sasha’s Manchester career can only be calculated on a quarterly basis, but they are already familiar to many people, except for football and swimming, they are also New members of the drama club and the Extreme Sports Group. Hopkins is already a good assistant to DuPont, and almost every freshman knows him. Manchester’s rugby team has always been one of the most eye-catching teams – when they train, many students take books to the court to encourage them to fight – they easily find the West from the new members. Bu. Bisangdi. This boy with olive skin, dark hair and eyes, is full of strength, runs fast, is responsive, and has a temperament and tolerance - this is the most important thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new members of the football team are almost all admitted to Manchester because of this skill. They can be said to be the best in the football team when they are in high school. There are many quarterbacks and full running backs, all of which are top-notch. Some of them, whether on the chest or on the top of the head, are a few inches wider and taller than Besib - even in adults, they are also daunting big bears, taking it for granted, they are not the kind of people who can spend most of their thoughts. The people who are learning - as we have described before, the average person's brain and body are limited, the body is exhausted, and the brain becomes dull, not to mention a training in the football field for more than four hours a day or more. The person, where did you let him take time to read the book? And their schools don't pay much attention to their studies—and Manchester's admission is not for them to be a biologist or historian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The results of their performance can only be said to be unsatisfactory, and there are many idiots that are arrogant, and the nerves are as difficult to control as the detonators of the insurance bolts. Manchester The coach is accustomed to it. Every new player is like this. Heavy training and constant blows (from old players and coaches) will make them smoother – but also because of this, among a group of gloomy newcomers. Besib, which has always maintained a steady state (whether physical or emotional), is more likely to be found and favored than Sangdi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Someone has provoked it, and Besib took him from the corner of the locker room to the other end, and guaranteed him a slight contusion and violent The pain is not a big problem - like the violent attempted by Hopkins, they have been systematically trained to master the "degree". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From that day on, Besib. Bisangdi became the hidden head of the new players, and the coach was happy to see it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishb and Sasha participated in the performance of the drama in Grande, Besib once appeared in the Venetian black general Othello, and Sasha preferred Mike Bai, in the second month of Manchester, they participated in a religious moral drama, describing "Death" calling "everyone" in the command of God. "Everyone" to his former friends "beautiful" and "friendship" , "love", "honor", "knowledge", "wealth", "right", etc., but as in real life, nothing can delay the pace of the summoner, they end up one after another After leaving, there is only "good deeds". Although "good deeds" cannot violate God's will, they can save the soul of "everyone" and make it warm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People think that Besib and Sasha will play "rights" and "beauty", or "honor" and "love" respectively, but in the end, don't Bu is "love", and Sasha is "good deed." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The writer and director of the moral drama thinks that "good deeds" are the most beautiful. As for love, what they need is not a strong martyr-like love, but a wave-like game-like*, or love will accompany everyone to the end. What should I do with good deeds? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This drama has been a great success, and the success is also Besib. "Good deeds" are beautiful, but they are graceful, elegant and covered with white. The robes, blondes, like angels, "good deeds" can only be awe-inspiring. In contrast, the slutty "love" is fascinating and yearning - some people comment on Facebook. The drama said straightforwardly: "If this is love, then I don't need a lifetime, give me one night."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this, Besib is also His roommate Quinta took a new nickname, called "One Night," and sometimes Sasha would use this to make fun of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a sangdi, Besib certainly does not care about this. The men of Poseidon Island pay attention to the family, but never mind to be short-lived with a woman. The ground is warm for a while, but Manchester is not a grandfather. He needs more contacts than a woman but a man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sounds a bit ambiguous, isn't it? But this is what he should do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is the tentacles of "Masoyye" infiltrating into the upper class, not the first one, but his father and Poseidon people hope that he can be the first One. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when it comes to women, Besib is involuntarily worried about his friends and brothers. In this regard, he always walks away from Sasha. What kind of woman Hopkins met was - look, his aunt, paranoia; Lila, formerly a mad dog, now a multiple personality; Chiz, a drug addict, and he killed her father, Then Hopkins didn't do anything good—especially for the little girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few minutes later, he saw Sasha and saw Chiz. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They walk side by side, look calm, attitude and embarrassment, it looks like a pair of heavenly creations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you think they are... Are you together..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besib looked at Richard and the guy seemed to be stuttering when he was nervous: "No."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
