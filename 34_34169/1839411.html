Catherine said: "I don't want to be too much." Are you sure you can control your ability? I have been in possession for more than 20 years, but I can't say absolutely now. No problem. How long, how many months or a few days?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chiz was silent for a while, her face was clearly revealed Confusion and uneasiness: "My ability... it's not strong - it's weak."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Very weak?" Catherine said thoughtfully: "It is said that a mentally capable abilities have become the most successful 'the day after tomorrow' for Samuel's - the genes of at least two people in your body, one of which is me and the other is ours. "Header."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The agency and Samuel are working together?" Chiz asked, otherwise she could not explain why Catherine knew this. She made sure she said that no one, including her mother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Unless Hell is frozen." Catherine said that her discovery was entirely an accident. The little girl’s emotions were too intense, so intense and exciting that Catherine subconsciously The ground "touched" her thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rich message she got from her surprised Catherine, and what made her most angry was that she was preparing to apply this ability to Sasha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for how accurately she guessed the source of Chiz Carson’s ability – thanks to the agency’s close attention to Samuel, Sama Before the evacuation agency, he almost got the blood of every actor who was named in the organization, including some of the internal organs and bone marrow, and hundreds of abilities (dead, and alive) who were detained in the g district. And his experiment, as Catherine said. It started 20 years ago, and a lot of plausible "finished products" were made ten years ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-man and half-dog guys, as well as Kemira, later tested that they have a body that can carry foreign genes into the recipient cells. Giant virus. Almost all of the genes can be extended to a known abilities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability will only pass with the genetic transmission - whether it is congenital or acquired, there is a single inheritance of the way the power is transmitted, such as Besib, Boa And Kemira; there are also mixed and mutated, such as Sasha and Lila, but no matter how confused and changed the latter, you can still see the roots - the head can attach his thoughts and spirit to other people ( It is also an invasion and occupation). And Catherine can interpret, remember and strengthen or weaken, and transfer the emotions of others. Chitz is neither the head nor Catherine's sister or daughter. None of John Carson and his wife and their parents are versatile. Her body has the ability to combine the characteristics of Catherine and the head, so the only credible explanation is left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether it is Catherine or the head, it is the cutest little tip on the pyramid of the abilities, and their genes will not combine a waste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chiz Carson is a dangerous person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And this is temporary," Chiz didn't know what Catherine thought of in this short moment, but she keenly smelled ominous The breath, she hurriedly shouted: "Temporary. It is like... um, an illusion, a very short-lived illusion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am listening." Catherine said: "Continue to say, little girl."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It will be a little hindered, I mean, Besib... and some others "Kiz said, a little hesitant: "It's not eliminated. I can't do that. I can't even find where they are - just a barrier. So as to avoid sudden interruptions or errors..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Error?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A seed," Chiz said: "An illusion."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What kind of illusion?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I and his." Chiz said: "Love, marriage, two Boy, a girl, one It’s getting old.” At this time, she calmed down and calmed down: “It’s no different from other people’s minds, at most, it’s a little more detailed—it’s only a couple of minutes.” But they are in me. The heart has been brewing for five years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You see, I can't let him suddenly think of Besib or the gentleman," she could even say a joke: "If the bride who has picked up the veil has Zhang Bixi. Bisangdi’s face, Sasha had to leave no trauma.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And worse, Catherine thought: “So this What's the use?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's not very useful," Chiz said frankly: "If Sasha suddenly fell in love with someone, especially me - he Quasi-feeling is strange. He is not stupid. It only takes a few seconds to react. I just want to ease his attitude. I mean, for me, let him stop being alert to me. Of course, occasionally, maybe He will want to kiss me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just like this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's it." Chiz said: "I can, no, what else will I do? Just like you said, Sasha is more important than my love."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bep is uneasy In front of Anthony Hopkins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doctor sits in front of his son’s bed, and the bruises and soft tissue contusions on Sasha have healed. Only the big wounds in the abdomen need to be checked. Only he was still asleep, the doctor noticed that his eyeball would occasionally turn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He holds his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Besib. Bisangdi?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He returned to Poseidon Island, "Bope honestly said: "Cechal. Bisangdi told him to go back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a bit strange, Anthony Hopkins wants He didn't even make a call, and he should know that his friend is in the hospital. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib jumped off the helicopter, in the dark night with the whistling wind The one who greeted him was Old Andriana. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishb asked, he was three hours ago Only when he saw that Sasha Hopkins was injured and was injured in the hospital, he was worried, because as a person who can respond quickly, entering the hospital is a very bad thing - but not In a few minutes, he received a call from Old Andriana. She asked him to go back to Poseidon Island immediately and not to contact anyone during the whole process. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Andriana’s meal feeds two “Tang” and one “Tang” in the future. Her loyalty is flawless, she rarely mentions Request or order, but as long as it is said, there is no room for negotiation, and you better listen to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Celegal is a little problem." Old Andriana said, take him all the way up the spiral staircase: "Only you can help him." ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
