			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let me see how you are doing now?" said Dr. Hopkins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even in just a few seconds, Besib almost failed to hold on - reality projected into the mind, the raging pain followed Almost a horror of the collapse of a veteran thug's spirit - his body is about to be lighted... only a little bit of bones, empty abdominal cavity, torn body cavity membrane Small half a stomach, half a lung, white bones, only the brain and heart, the spinal cord is carefully protected, but it can't last too long, a few minutes, or a few seconds? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He really wants to cry and call his mother, but unfortunately his mother doesn’t know where he is, maybe he’s already dead, and he is eating him. father. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When you return to your body," the doctor said: "You won't hurt so much. After all, you are more like a big plate now. The pasta of ketchup, the same is true of Chegal, just more - the adrenaline is flowing around, like a banknote in the inflation period, you can squander at will."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Andriana?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is dead," Sasha said. "If you want to ask this, she The body is still alive, but her $(an)(shuba). consciousness is not enough to affect anyone, including herself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s your job,” said Anthony Hopkins. “Bishb, only you.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishb looked at him, Then, my friends and brothers, I did not accidentally see the worry and hesitation from the purple eyes. "Of course, only me." He said. Before Sasha made any representations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way Hopkins clarifies his attitude is really simple and rude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib was suddenly slammed back into his consciousness, he had no time to understand the physical condition (as it is), now the most urgent need and must It's the war, between him and Chegal, son and father, between the two powers, their abilities are so close, the combat methods are similar - swallowing, violent and primitive, Chegal Of course, it has already gained the upper hand. But can not say that it is a foregone conclusion - every piece of meat that has been swallowed but not yet dissolved. As long as it has nerves that receive brain waves, it can do the opposite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the original vision of Old Andriana, Besib should be imprisoned in his own consciousness in isolation, his body and brain are isolated. Until the last point is broken down and absorbed. The spiritual world attached to the flesh will naturally disintegrate. But now, the net she set up has been taken back, and Besib has been able to regain control of her body. So the pieces of meat that were forced to swallow were turned into knives and bombs hidden in the body of Chegal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meat that swells into most of the rooms emits high frequency (like a dolphin) screaming, mixed together, you eat me, I eat you, be The carefully protected heart and brain ran like a piece of pudding in the pudding, trying not to be discovered by the other soldiers. It was too difficult. The meat of the father and the son was like being poured into one. In the sausage machine, they are stirred together and stuffed into a tough, elastic casing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha wakes up in the West, he is as tired as ever, and he The father slept next to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned his head to look at the window, the curtains were closed, the curtains were dark brown and heavy satin, and the inner layer was covered with blackout cloth and gauze, but there was still light. Adjacent from each gap. The time difference between Manchester and Poseidon Island is only one and a half hours. That is to say, Poseidon Island is also dawning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a slight tremor and humming sound from his mobile phone. He reached out and grabbed the phone. It was a strange number. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hand crossed his chest and picked up the phone. Dr. Hopkins did not speak. He only listened, then nodded and pressed. After the phone, he touched his son's lower eyelids, and there was a black-green. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Besib is alive," he said. "Cecalle is also alive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sasha slightly raised his eyes. He did not expect both to be alive: "This is really no better news," he said sincerely, full of joy, and then he paused for a moment: "You help me." They?" he said conclusively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because a hateful old thing complains that I am not as sincere to your friends." The ghoul said: "I want to refute him once, that's it." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Celegal is still alive, but the situation is terrible. But he is still alive and can solve many things while he is alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His body is not enough to fulfill the duties of "Tang", so in some areas, Besib, who has not yet reached the legal xingjiao age, needs to be in place, one The young "Tang" who can't be ignored, the performance of his previous performance is not so good. About one in six or seven people maintain a wait-and-see attitude. Those who stand on his side may not have the opportunity to make a deceit. The meaning of the princes, some people have reacted strongly, thinking that they do not need a cowardly "Tang" like a mainlander. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing that Besib did was to submit an application for suspension of study, and his, as well as Sasha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When this approved application was forwarded to Brian, Lor, not Miss Lor, but Mr. Lor happened to be sitting next to him He took the opportunity to check the e-mail first: "It only takes a year?" He directed the mouse to move down. Poseidon Island can be said to be the cecum of this country. Many people think it is useless and cumbersome. It will be fatal, but some people, I mean, some people who have the right to speak think that it is better to remove it than to remove it. However, with the development of medical technology, it has been suggested that the cecum may be quite useful for human organs. One. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, Poseidon Island is well received, not to mention that it is now a family member, and even a few days later, even Manchester is still very The younger ones can also get a lot of news from various channels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you think they will each hire a team of lawyers and then start a lawsuit over the years?" Brian said: "The solution to the mob - not too elegant, It’s not too civilized, but it’s very efficient.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The Lions,” Mr. Lor said: “I’m sorry, I originally wanted to be Sasha. Pukins's guides - In addition, if you discuss it next year, then the problem of Besib. Bissand can be solved. They may like to add the name of a thug leader to the book. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't take this joke," Brian said. "They may not welcome Bissau."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "As far as I know, there are already six people who think we need new blood, even if it's a bit dirty, but it may enhance the lion's immunity, and then it contains some toxins that are also quite good for hunters. Mr. Lor is boring to move the wheel in the middle of the mouse: "Although we have left Manchester Special, I can't participate in the ceremony, but we can at least find a place nearby to have a good past few days to meet new people. What do you think of the Tali Lodge? The President is also on vacation."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned the chair: "Are you going?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I am going." Brian said that he didn't seem to notice the other meaning of the question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Great," said Mr. Lor, a young man. "You haven’t been with us for more than a year. You have been like a criminal. I am worried about you," he said half-truly. "No one else is like you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because they are not the one who shot "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This can't blame you," said Lol. "We have all drunk, and we have smoked marijuana. It is not you who propose to play this game." It’s not you who took out the gun. Dear, you should understand that it’s just a small mistake, but you are always worried...” He taunted: “You are acting like a broken saint, cloth. Ryan, you make us feel uncomfortable, Wade said that you may commit suicide."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I opened the gun."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Shut up, damn, God, that’s just an unfortunate accident!" Lol couldn’t help but yell: "Everyone has to be responsible for his actions, that damn it. Cow also She knows what she is doing, she knows, we have to admit that she is very hard - but that is just a show, the apple is placed in the mouth of the roast pig, she put it on her head, no one forced her No one is going to trick her into doing this. She is an adult. She shouts to let you shoot, and still wanders there. No one can match in that situation, even 007 can't. You should not resist all your guilt!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the people of Poseidon and Masoye did not think about how to face the new "Tang", the new "Tang" was ready to face them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is as crazy and quick to eradicate his enemies as he has removed the weeds in the garden, even if he brings some innocent flowers and plants. He had the money and people in the bright and secret land that Chegal had given him, and the abilities, and the unprepared ordinary people could hardly resist them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These people got what they wanted," Pepi said, and the little eyes reflected a raging fire: "They want a cruel and fierce 'Tang', they With."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
