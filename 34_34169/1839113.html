			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abel raised his hand and looked at his watch. The black minute hand and the hour hand formed a slightly twisted "-" symbol on the white surface. At 3:45 in the morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the monitor screen, he can see that Catherine is kneeling beside Sasha Hopkins, her hands holding the child tightly The little hand hanging on the side of the bed, his forehead with his own crossed thumb, his mouth stretched straight, and he was engrossed, and could not tolerate a distraction between things that had nothing to do with Sasha Hopkins - and the object of her concern and assistance The face was disastrous (the child’s cheeks were sunken all over, the hair was dull, the eyes were closed, and the dark skin clung to the bones, like another dry and chemically treated child in the catacombs of Sicily, Italy. Dry corpse), breathing slightly, slow, unconscious shackles of the hands and feet (very small, if not enough eyes are not sensitive enough, can not see). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How long has this been?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you mean by coma?" Road: "About fifteen minutes." He called out the previous image and speeded up, and then the two saw the strange and terrible scene on the monitor screen - like those shown in popular science films. The process of rapid wilting, the child's face and the exposed hands and feet are quickly grayed out in the pain-induced distortion, dry up... It is conceivable that the place covered by the sheets will not be better. Abel snorted, this short film is not pleasing to the eye, he heard the so-called "spiritual influence on the flesh", but never thought it would be so terrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special object is still a child... Abel tilted his head and glanced at him. The guards around him were ruddy, tall and fat, and the facial features were ordinary and even It’s a bit ugly, but it’s still likable – maybe because he has a very sincere and honest smile, but this person controls the entire surveillance room, from machine to person – in the case of Sasha Hopkins When he was abnormal, he insisted on observing the monitor for more than half an hour. During this time, no one was allowed to enter the room of Sasha Hopkins. In the end, he notified not only the medical department but also the security department. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cautious and sensible person, Abel sincerely hopes that his excellent qualities can be transferred to his new partner Catherine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For men, women are always an incomprehensible creature, and Abel thinks that Catherine is the leader. He didn't understand why this beautiful young girl couldn't see the facts that were in front of her eyes. After so many experiences, she still unconsciously thought that this little guy in front of her eyes was a blinded little angel, a lost lamb, as long as she By paying attention and love with perseverance, I can pull him out of the fallen, dirty abyss in time—Abel clearly remembers how the child abandoned Catherine in front of a bloody serial murderer, no matter what How to say, always protect and care for his woman, his mother's sister - perhaps his only relative in the world, without a little hesitation and nostalgia; not to mention that Martin has complained and complained to him more than once. How has this child destroyed his revenge plan, and it is not worth mentioning that others are not worth mentioning. Human selfishness is engraved in genes and even souls... but at the moment of life and death, those who can abandon themselves are real. It is terrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chinese have an old saying "three old to see old", Abel is deeply impressed, Sasha Hopkins has been Anthony Hopkins His father, the "Ghoul", was completely polluted, incorrigible, and irreparable. This is a rooted, deeply rooted ghost, which directly affects the child's thoughts, judgments, cognition, and establishment. On the basis of this behavior, he has forever lost the opportunity to be a normal person, just like an adult can never become a child again. Even if his brain is removed, the terrible roots have encroached on every nerve and every cell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can love him, but you must not despise him. And Catherine just forgot the most important point. Abel shook his head. This silly girl will soon be sold once by this seemingly lovely and docile child, or many times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation of Sasha Hopkins gradually stabilized. Catherine stood up and gave the position to the doctor behind her. She could see that she was very tired, but Still insisting on staying in the room of Sasha, she turned her back to the camera and stared at the small bed of Sasha, motionless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s undeniable that Catherine is indeed a pretty girl. Abel thought, even from the back, this woman is also very attractive - her hair has been cut short because of the treatment, now they are squashed in groups of well-shaped heads, it looks Like the head of a furry little lamb - golden, down the slender neck, thin shoulders, beautiful back, rounded buttocks, strong thighs, straight calves, she even has both feet It is exquisite and compact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A friend of Abel once asked him half-jokingly whether he was attracted by Catherine’s beauty to accept the agency’s instructions: accept this untrusted As a partner, the woman knows that almost everyone knows what Catherine had done before. She once left her partner and caused his death. The fire of Alija is also difficult to disengage. Relationship; the task of the post-institution and the responsibility of the disregard, the child with a criminal fled to a place that he thought was safe - so that it was also a victim of a slaughterhouse... The most unforgivable thing is that She regards the kindness and magnanimity of the institution as nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silly girl knows nothing and knows nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She and her little nephew have so far been able to safely owe her new abilities. Her ability could have been said to be a special and rare one, and in this short span of months, this wonderful and useful ability is constantly strengthening, changing and expanding, for example, coming. Before Aliya, she could only confirm whether the object being tracked was correct by the vague and single identification of the residual feeling. In the town, she was able to manipulate herself or other people's feelings to attack. Now, she It seems that the feeling of being left behind by the plural crowds can be traced back to the past. The reason why they can trace the serial killer is to rely on what Catherine "reads" from the evidence and blood. Perhaps her ability will continue to expand, and it will develop into a weapon that is difficult to compare with "reading mind". Because she can not only read what you think now, but also get a deeper understanding of the people or things you touched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ability will make the organization and even the next level of leaders ecstatic, but for her personally, this is not a good thing, No one wants to be exposed to others in private, not to mention those who are in desperate need of forgetting. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abel can almost imagine the situation of Catherine’s ability to be exposed after the exposure. This is normal. When it comes to self-interest, people tend to abandon a lot of things, love, Family and friendship are not worth a visit. Because Abel is like this, although he still has a few friends, but in addition to the courageous Su, few people will be so close to him, let alone partner with him, um, even if it is Su, it will not. Because his ability is to exchange his life for what he wants, the stronger the vitality, the more precious it is. Who can guarantee that he will not catch someone close to him in exchange for a lifeline when he is dying or in a fatal crisis? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hasn’t done it before, but in the town he did it, although only Catherine and the “Black Sacrifice” saw it, and neither of them said anything. But Abel is very clear that he has exchanged his life for his life and money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
