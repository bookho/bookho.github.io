			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine looked at her nephew completely without cover, her thin hands clasping each other under the table, human vision, hearing, smell, Bioelectric currents that are impossible to capture by touch and taste are flowing in the air. Some sensitive people may feel that a "quirk" is passing in front of their eyes, but at this time, probably no one will care. This – people sitting at the gambling table need to concentrate, the supervisors, bookkeepers, and the managers and guards at the top of the stilts and ladders have not yet relaxed or slackened. As for the onlookers. (After the people in Ivan control the situation, the guards no longer ask them to leave, but they are not allowed to rely too close.) Their emotions are more exciting than the six people involved in the death roulette. Someone has started. Sitting in Zhuang - gambling who is the first victim, someone gambling Catherine, some people bet Sasha, the most people on Hopkins, Ivan is almost no, the two female companions around him are also the answer, in It’s not here. People, they know what's going on here, no one wants to show pity for the prey that falls into the net, public opinion raises objections or helps them get out of the obvious danger - the initial horror has passed, the bloody scene can be expected They were thrilled, the neighboring Baccarat table was vacated, and piles of chips and cash underneath the ashtrays representing the six-person position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They open their eyes, spit out their tongues, open their nostrils, and eagerly await the death of a person, like a group of browns on a savanna Walking the dog or the vultures hovering in the hot air, layer by layer, the malicious and "happy" swarming makes Catherine breathless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her eyes fell on Dr. Hopkins’s well-defined side of the face, and he quickly noticed it, turned his head and smiled at her, White and small teeth show a ceramic luster under bright light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib stood still. But the muscles of his legs and shoulders began to become tense. The man standing behind him noticed that the cold weapon against the boy's spine aggravated the weight: "Don't move, silly boy," the man said: "I can Open a big hole in your body all at once, let your belly fill the ground - and you don't want to do anything until then."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;Sasha Hopkins has picked up the gun. This pistol is a bit big for him. He has to put his elbow down and tilt the gun slightly to ensure that the muzzle is aimed at his temple. Before the shooting, he observed the opposite side. It is said that the woman who served both Ivan's daughter and affectionate wife was more panicked than any of the previous ones. Her fingers scratched the green felt table. Her lips trembled - she rubbed a pretty bright rose lipstick, a thick layer, and sprinkled gold powder on it - Sasha had learned from her father how to interpret the lips, even if she had It is not a lingua franca, he can understand what the other party is saying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is saying, "It is him. It is him, that is him..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha looked at her, slowly pulled the trigger, and the table around the table had changed. It was very quiet, "hey," everyone heard it. After a short silence for a few seconds, the gamblers shouted, and most of them were lamenting their bad luck. Only a few people were ecstatic with the paper in their hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivan’s revolver is a six-hair model with a bullet inside, and they have six people, that is, there must be someone to be beaten by themselves. head. Now Ivan, his dark-haired female companion, Catherine and Hopkins have all gone under the scythe of death. The only one who did not touch the gun was her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately. You guessed it wrong." Sasha said that he put the gun on the table of the table and gently pushed it over: "I I think I should have misunderstood what you mean?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like Ivan, a young woman with a soft yellowish ochre hair stares at Sasha, her eyes vicious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s your turn."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She jerked her head and found her talking When I was Ivan, her eyes suddenly became desperate. What she wanted to say, Ivan raised a hand in advance. "Don't say too much, my little baby," when his palm fell. women instinctively shivered, but this time Ivan did not hit her, "take up guns," he repeated: "we gotta finish the program." <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; She hesitated, Ivan gently stroked her neck: "Go, go," he said in a sweet and amiable tone: "We don't have much time - believe me, I will follow the rules I said before." "Things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivan’s daughter, or affectionate wife, looked at the pile of chips shrouded in the shadow of Ivan – 200 million from Hopkins Yuan was dumped into the treasury of the casino by Ivan. He immediately exchanged 50 million chips and asked to pile them on the table. Ivan has indeed announced the rules - 50 million to buy a bullet, if the money is Ivan, she is quite difficult to make up her mind, but she soon thought that the money is the opposite of Ivan What the unlucky person got - can give 200 million, can give more, Ivan will not care about the money, he just wants to make a gesture to prove to people that this gambling is "fair and fair", she Knowing Ivan, he is a bad villain, but always wants people to regard him as a hero and a gentleman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wiped her wet hand on the skirt, and a nail cracked, but she didn't notice it. She grabbed the gun and held her skull. She even wants to smile, perform better, backfire, her eyeliner and false eyelashes are melting - excess water washes her cheeks, blurring her eyes and ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivan walked behind her, can be said to hold the yellowish twilight head lovingly, and the short and short fingers suddenly became incredibly flexible. He quickly grabbed the little finger that passed through the trigger ring and pressed it down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine has seen the human body and head being blown up by bullets more than once, but there is no doubt that this is the most unexpected and disgusting thing she feels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivan has enough money, but he seems to never think about buying this bullet, because the muzzle is very close, the bullet is not deformed too More than the head of this young woman, who is only about twenty years old, left two holes in the left and right cheekbones. The hole is not very big, blood is pouring from the inside, and her hair is glued together. Ivan took the gun from her hand and let go, letting her body fall to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Continue." Ivan slowly returned to his seat. He swallowed a vodka and looked relaxed. It seemed that he was only on the toilet. Some cumbersome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Before starting a new round, maybe we should make the whole gambling fair." Dr. Hopkins said, "You only have two people now." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ivan paused for a moment, and immediately he showed a sly smile: "You are right," he is a dark-haired female companion. Nodded. "We are the fair point. The gambling must be fair and interesting." He whispered his lips: "So who are you leaving?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sasha." Catherine immediately said, "I stayed with him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivan licked his head. "How do you say, Mr. Hopkins?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sasha leaves," Hopkins said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Ivan hooked the trigger arc, letting the whole gun spin on his hand, screaming, and the people behind Sasha The muzzle stepped back, Sasha stood up, left the table, and stood side by side with Besib, and the barrel quickly returned to its original position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
