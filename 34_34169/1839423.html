			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;72_72600 Jumping around, sipping this cold and deadly pleasure! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Humans love to fly, although they have no wings, but perhaps because of this Their desire to fly freely in the air is better than in the water and on the ground – so it’s not surprising that they are passionate about any activity that allows them to move away from gravity for a short time, even if that’s the case. Activities are dangerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White snow, pine black, red, yellow and green The poles and the silver-gray protective net outline the outline of the snowy road. The mountains and browns and whites in the vicinity are far and wide. Their tips are straight from the thorny blue sky - where they live. A glimpse of the ski slopes with private slides - when invited, Mr. Lor called it a log cabin, in fact it is a townhouse with twelve rooms, each room The terrace with dark green stone floor and simple log railings, the first sun in the morning is sprinkled on it like a layer of even gold powder from the hand of God, very beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young people are as light as a small bird sliding into their rooms through private slides - the ground floor of the building is a bit like openness The warehouse or the shop, the rolling shutters are pulled up, the interior is empty, the lights are bright, the solid snow extends all the way down the steps, the walls are hung with various hooks and seats, and Besib is seeing the lights. It has slowed down. He simply sneaked into his own basement at a walking speed. He stopped using no turning or other movements. He hit the ski with a ski pole. The clip attached to the ski boot, knock it loose and break free from it. Then there is another one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood up the skis, there were fixtures on the wall, the ski poles hung on the wall, took off the goggles, and hung it on the front Inside the zipper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bottom of the ski boots that have not been taken off has a nail that can be directly plunged into the hard ice surface, hitting the stone floor and creaking, he walks into the same layer Kitchen. Sasha is already inside. Changed the ski boots, stepped on a pair of furry brown flip-flops, dotted with cute rows of hair balls. Making his feet look twice as wide and long, a pot of steaming savory milk tea sizzling on the electromagnetic stove with ginger, cream, butter and milk, honey and salt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come a cup?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's best to give me a pot." Besib said. The abilities can withstand low temperatures and high temperatures, but tolerating does not mean that it is very comfortable: "Today is particularly cold."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Tomorrow will cool down." Say. Pour him a full cup of milk tea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishb made a face: "It is a good thing to cool down. We have to worry about an avalanche when it continues to heat up. What is in the pot?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stewed venison." Sasha said, "I also let them bring the cheese pot. Go to change the shoes. Besib, we should have dinner." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bessib not only changed his boots, but also took a quick but hot shower. The people here have used the natural hot springs rich in minerals to relieve fatigue and treat wounds in the ancient Roman period. The water temperature in the Duo family's "chalet" is higher than that in other places. About thirty-eight degrees, the light brown skin of Poseidon Island is covered with a thin layer of red, with a milky white mist on the hair. There is only one thick black bathrobe on the body, and the cuffs are turned up and on the feet. Instead, I wore a pair of fluffy boots that were not inferior to Sasha's. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door to the basement of the kitchen has been closed. From the rectangular wooden frame glass we can see the cold back of the snowy mountain outside the corridor, which has not been developed. There are no traces of humanity, the layers of trees are stacked, the crown generally surrounds and arches the creamy snow, and some of the blue-gray rocks are exposed. From their direction, it can be seen where the wind came from and where it went. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the small pot on the small alcohol stove, the cheese has melted, the rich milk aroma fills the kitchen, and Sasha stands in front of the counter, Bananas, avocados, pineapples, cooked broccoli, carrots and small tomatoes are cut into pieces, bread and mashed potatoes are ready, and the crust is piled up in a huge wooden bowl with potatoes with rosemary and bacon grains. The mud is placed in two plates and piled up in the shape of a snow-capped mountain with whipped cream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stewed venison is in another pot, stewed with red wine and thyme, bay leaf, with garlic and freshly ground black pepper, each with adult males Half of the palm of the hand, Besib pre-emptive taste of a piece, meat tender and smooth, full of flavor, is Hopkins's craft is right. In the past few years, he has been able to eat the food made by Sasha occasionally. It is more and more normal. Others may think that he has passed the age of wanting to be amazed by the wonderful craftsmanship. Besib I do not think so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha put the pieces on the table, and Besib had already made the hot cocoa, which added nearly half of the vodka. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two young people, healthy and strong, after a long day of intense exercise, or in the cold weather, the appetite becomes unusual and not good. Strange things, they kept quiet for the first few minutes, taking turns to pick up the spoon and fork from the venison pot and the cheese pan until a piece of pineapple slipped from the sprinkled fork and fell into the cheese pan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey," Besib said: "You should go out for a lap." (According to tradition, people who drop raw materials into the cheese pot should accept it.) The punishment for running a lap)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha said aloud the swear words commonly used by the people of Poseidon, which probably meant to stuff the sharks into your babies. of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib smiled to the bottom of the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha glared at him, Besib. Bisangdi had not been so happy for a while, and his thoughts went very far. The place, so much that he did not think about it when he asked the question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib asks this question: "How about cocoa?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's very good. Sasha replied, but he immediately discovered that it was a trap, so he lifted the cup and carefully smelled the inside. "Do you add salt?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A lot of salt." Besib said: "But you taste very sweet, right? The taste is wrong - it lasted for five or six years, and you promised that I will solve it as soon as possible. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The taste disorder does not have much impact on me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you just like to I don’t have any opinions on the blueberry sauce on the steak. I care about its cause – does Anthony Hopkins know?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Of course.” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why shouldn’t he cure you?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He tried, from a long time ago, the problem came to me." Sasha had no choice but to play with the cocoa cup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hell, I don't believe what is something that Anthony Hopkins can't do - especially in this regard, he can even cut people off His nose and face fed his own dog!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But, Besib, God, I am his son. And..." Sasha calmly said: "He loves me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Yes," after a brief silence, Besib bite irritably Help the flesh, "Love, no, that's not just love - he just sees you... looks like it - the only light and fire in the whole world, he is not Chegal. Bisand, he is jealous. "I don't care." He managed to control himself, but finally gave up: "But if so, what should you do? You won't hurt him, you will never stand on his opposite side, anyway, No matter what he did, you will only be his son, right? Even if it will make you suffer for life - Sasha, your spirit and your behavior will be two extremes. Two noose cables, you will be cut into two by them sooner or later, and how long have you suffered before? What should you do?" He repeated, once and again: "What should you do?" ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he raised his eyes, he found that his friends and brothers were staring at him, smiling, not speaking, and looking firm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are a fool, a mixed ball." Besib said, his eyes are hot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are also, brother." Since the fight against Besib. Bissand has lifted his marriage contract with Marttina, he knows what he wants to do. - He wants to break the bond between Sasha Hopkins and Poseidon, and the friendship between them, he is already the "Tang" of Poseidon Island, he is deeply immersed in the mud, he is bloody, himself Others, he has too many things that cannot be preserved and things that must be carried, but at the very least, he can make Hopkins free. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he also has something that can't be changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha Hopkins is the son of Anthony Hopkins, the father of Sasha Hopkins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(To be continued)(To be continued)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
