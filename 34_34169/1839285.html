			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hayman brother, the saint let you see him." Hayman’s seventy-seventh sister whispered that she is a few who don’t have to watch the whole One of the people in the trial and execution process, because she has a more important task - to care for and comfort their saints, she is also Milian's sister, two years younger than her predecessor. When talking, this undeveloped girl barely dared to look directly at Heyman. The reverberation also had a slight, unobtrusive but still tremorable feeling. It seems that even if she stayed in the house all the time, it was not to the outside world. The things are really ignorant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hyman’s pale face, which was soaked by the cold wind and rain, suddenly glowed like the glory of the dying patient’s last return. The bones were covered with red tide, the eyes were shiny, he didn't ask anything, or when, because he immediately turned and walked into the room, the two sinners possessed by the devil were still burning, more than one Hundred and fifty Strange Jacobs are still frozen in the rain, and all kinds of critical documents pile up like mountains. The amazing number of conversations and meeting lists fill up all the time except prayer and practice. No, these are not. Important, Hayman’s mind is only Jared Strang Jacob, his father on the ground, the man who raised him, his master, his love, his everything - the sage Jared has been for a long time. He did not take the initiative to summon Heyman. As he grew older, he did not want to see his son and nephews again. His younger brother did not allow him. Every man who was younger and healthier than him would make him feel angry and anxious. And a woman who is over 20 years old will make him upset. His fifty-four wives were expelled from his room. He did not allow them to touch their bodies. The only young and pure little flowers that could be around him, some of them were his little daughters, and Some are his granddaughters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerrid.The room of the room is located at the highest point of the entire mansion, and its entire face is a one-way visible glass. The glass is silver-plated, sturdy and explosion-proof, and is often used in prisons, public prosecution agency interrogation rooms, psychiatric hospitals, university research institutes, and large conference rooms. The Jared Sage often observes his children and grandchildren behind it. When necessary, it can also be opened to reveal the room behind it - Jared's room is like a small sanctuary with black oak siding on the white marble wall, except for the whole face Outside the glass walls, there are no windows, and the portraits of the saints are hung on the walls. The wall facing the glass wall is an altar made of walnut, covered with three layers of white linen, and even delicately carved gold on the feet. Inlaid with gems, a set of sacred objects, a silver "sacred dish" (sacrificial plate); a cup of wine, "the prince" (caled), the priest with a cover of the sacred body - called "the prince" Or "holy box." On the small table next to it is a "bottle". There are also hand washing trays, washcloths and bells, and the boat-type furnaces are all silvery, and they are old, and in the dark rooms, they are as soft and gentle as human teeth. There is no cross. There is only one oil painting that is as wide as an adult, depicting that 500 years ago, Jared (the founder of the supervising sect) accepted the baptism and enlightenment of angels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jared in the painting is wearing a simple brown robes. With bare feet and white hair, it doesn't look old, spirited, and neuropathic. The sky was bursting with a gap, and the golden light was scattered on him. It was like putting a luxurious robes on him. The angels were flying in the air, and they were sending a sleek thick book and a feather pen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This book is the basis of the supervision of the sect, and Jared calls it the "book of truth", which has the most comprehensive and correct Bible. Interpretation, Jared spent decades of transcripts to transcribe it, and then, in the same morning, the angels took the book and the pen back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The founder of the superintendent sect, Jared, lives as long as Jacob’s son, Jacob, that is, he lived a whole 147 years old. He was sixty years old when he accepted the call and giving, and then used thirty years to transcribe the entire "real technique." For the next half century, he created it as promised to God. Supervise the sect, and let it take root, grow leaves, and give birth to fruit - he married forty-seven wives and raised one hundred and sixty sons and eighty-eight daughters, all of whom are pious and healthy. They are the earliest monks and nuns of the Superintendent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Jared stretched out her fingers and fascinated and stroking the face of the founder who had the same name as him until he was summoned by God and created a master. Rhett never had any disease. On the day before his death, he was still preaching. He went swimming in the lake and gave birth to a pony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But due to the devil's jealousy, death only entered the world." He snorted, exhausted and returned to the wheelchair, the maid on the side immediately slammed He put a little dusty finger into his mouth. Jared felt the moist and warm touch, relaxed his shoulders, and even closed his eyes slightly. "Give me a glass of wine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wine is very It was quickly put in a silver tray and steamed with orange, cloves and cinnamon, and a piece of chocolate next to it. The person who is holding the wine is not the maid who has just left the room, but Heyman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hayman." Jared said that the tone was dull, neither happy nor angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, my father." Hayman knees down, kneels beside Jared, picks up his hand, kisses him respectfully On the back of the wrinkled hand, he found that his father was very old, and the skin that his lips touched was as crisp, dry and cold as the preserved ancient paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jared pulled his hand back, and Hayman's skin was tight and smooth, and the heat of the blood erupted from the source, which made him deeply hateful. "Get out!" he shouted at the maid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you feel now?" Heyman asked with concern, still lying on the ground, just straightening his body and raising his hand, he I want to touch Jared's forehead, which is wrapped in clean linen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerder turned his head in disgust: "They have already painted me wine and oil." It was just a small wound, it was the foot of the bed. A raised decoration is opened, the wound is only half the length of the little finger, and the blood flowing out is not enough to fill a spoon. Even if it is left alone, it can grow well, but the monks and maids who take care of Jared are responsible. Don't dare to be so sloppy, they wipe the wound with wine and olive oil as described in the Bible. Then wrap it in boiling linen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The devil attached to Millian and another boy has been expelled," Hayman said. "Her mother was sentenced to exile, and boy The mother was fined and monitored."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why can a boy's mother be forgiven?" Jared slaps the arm of the wheelchair with dissatisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The boy’s education is not for women," Hayman said softly. "Tonight his teacher will be sent outside, and his mother is very "The devil will catch the heel."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look at them, Hayman, watch them, watch our lambs," Jared whispered Tao: "The devil is always omnipresent. Everything that is related to him must be removed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course. Of course." Heyman is also low Responding, he lowered his head and pressed his forehead against his father's knee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerder reached out and touched Heyman’s head absently: “When is Harlan coming back?” This is what he really cares about, too. The only reason to summon Hayman's arrival. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hyman's breathing stopped for a moment. But he quickly adjusted it: "Not yet, father, we haven't found him yet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerried reveals a bored smile," Is it still not, or never? Hayman, are you really looking for a hay? No..." He made a gesture: "I don't want to hear you explain. Hayman, no matter what you did before, I am No matter. I only tell you," he licked Heyman's hair with his fingertips and grabbed them. His hand was as powerful as twenty years ago, and Heyman was dragged to him. Looking up at the face, "I will give you two Sabbath time. Find him and tell him, I will allow him to come back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He touched Heyman's face and his fingers stayed in his eyes: "How young, how healthy, and full of life... Hayman, find him, I need to behave, his power is God's gift, I was born. He, he should return it to us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He won't come back, he has fallen, he was lured by the devil, his soul is dark It was you who tried his sin and exiled him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jered smiled and he understood the thoughts of the younger son: "So I can also forgive He - I want to remind you, Hayman, you are a big sin." His thumb touched Heyman's eye, like playing with a cheap glass ball to play with the warm beads, squeezing it, 揉Pinch it, completely disregarding the stiffness felt by the palm: "I love you, Hayman, my little son, but you can't do what I want you to do, it doesn't matter, I know you can't do anything, I don't because of this. Blame you, my son, but you have to do what you can do - find haze."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't find him." Heyman said that the pressure on the eyeball almost increased at the same time. The warm liquid spilled over the corner of the eye and flowed into the hair: "He I have converted to the old teacher... Father, he has even changed his name. His current name is Stefan, and Harlan is dead!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "He is still alive," Jared said coldly, his nails had been inserted into the hot, wet sphere. "Take him back, Hayman, he has to work for his father, he belongs to me." Tell him, I will forgive him, the Lord will forgive him, I will wear it on the good robe, put the ring on his finger, put the shoes on his feet, and bring the fat calf to the slaughter The hot wine is brought to me - everything will belong to him, he will be the next Jared, the next saint."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "He is a sinner..." The pain made Heyman take a sigh of relief. He grabbed the arm of the wheelchair, did not push his father, and did not escape. He was there. It doesn't move: "But if it's your wish, I will do it, I will. - Soon, father, you have already seen it, Messiah... Messiah has already appeared."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerry looked at him questioningly: "Is that child?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The child," Hayman Say: "Hello will come back, for him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is not ours. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
