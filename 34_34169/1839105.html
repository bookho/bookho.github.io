			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door behind Catherine was suddenly opened, she fell involuntarily, a pair of warm hands quickly caught her, and semi-mandatory She was dragged behind a broad-brown olive tree. In the next moment, a few bullets leaped through the place she had occupied. They opened the plastic dashboard and the metal door. It was as easy as tearing a piece of paper, and the engine was broken, metal fragments. Flying around, one of them passed through Catherine's thigh, but fortunately did not directly hit the artery and bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked up in a stunned look, grabbing her is Sergeant Abel, his face is serious, his eyes are very gentle, with some pity... Yes, mercy, Catherine thought, fucking, she was abandoned again, the object is not even a handsome, gentle and young gold prince, just a six-year-old boy with a stinky, she knows he doesn't want to I stayed with myself, but this did not prevent Catherine from caring for him in the past six months. Caring for it, okay, she knew that he was not rare, but at least he had to hesitate at least, throwing her into an anger. Cruel and continuous kidnapping of murderers - he is really crisp and neat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"ghoul" should be nearby. Otherwise, Sasha will not rush to get rid of himself. He is more useful than a female monkey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abel picked up Catherine’s leg and used a knife to cut her jeans into strips to do the pressure to stop bleeding for the bloody wounds. Catherine looked up, her voice groaning between her teeth, perhaps because of pain, or anger, but both, her eyes were blurred, but she could still see the overturned vehicles on the gray road, shallow The black silhouette and the golden red sparks from the muzzle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The guns are useless to them." Catherine said in a snarl: "especially if they are prepared."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So what is useful to them?" Abel was busy tightening the bandage while watching closely the encirclement: a bad start. Probably no one can think that the "most useless guy" in the town dared to kill the guards of the town while most young men were going to deal with the beasts that besieged the children, forcibly taking away the members of the institution as bait (maybe The "pre-" and the future victims should be added... The "waiting for the rabbit" scheme is just like a soap bubble blown out by a child. The most lively thing is that there is only one road leading to the outside of the town. If he didn't apply for a team member who is good at camouflage from the beginning, the plan can be hung up with the "end" sign. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the members of the action group is leaving, as he goes, like the oil painting being restored or restored, the two cars gradually get out of the "dissolved" olives The woods and the air appeared, and the first few people who jumped out of the car had already handed in the "black rituals" with half of the town priest's face. They had a full fire reserve and a clear goal. Everyone is here. Fire in an orderly manner, one burst of six or seven bullets, from top to bottom, from left to right, bullets whistling through the road, bushes and olive groves, picking up cement, grass, dirt and bark - - In the next few minutes, Abel and Catherine had to constantly try to push themselves into the gutters under the shoulders of the road, sharing this stubborn and safe place with the rotten sludge and lively mosquitoes. Even so, Catherine suffered a second injury - a jumper hit under her shoulder, and Abel was scratched the scalp and shoulders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine muttered vaguely, she was exhausted, feeling chilly and drowsy: "They want to murder us."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Murder is never allowed, and manslaughter is hard to avoid." Abel said: "No matter whether it is a companion or an enemy, the bullet's range is not a good place to talk in a daze."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine silently cursed the man's untimely sense of humor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's understandable that the above value is worth the city." Abel's eyes flicked and flew a few scent of water: "You should know the rules of the organization - he Now I can almost wait for the same World War II battleship."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine keeps silent, members of the organization will consciously return some of the prizes to the agency if they are not dead (this There are very few cases. Then, after getting approved from the institution (which is less likely), they are their pensions. If they die, the money will be included in the public funds of the institution to reward the criminal who killed them. . Therefore, as long as you board the institution's "reward list", no matter how embarrassing, murderous, and good at hiding, the criminals will eventually be arrested or killed, because this cumulative method is completely vicious for them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Black Sacrifice" doubled the amount of their reward in just half a year. It is conceivable that the list of deaths behind the reward amount is How to grow in the same proportion of madness. If Catherine can return to the organization six months ago, detailing the circumstances of the criminal, maybe he will not add value so quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abel did not continue on this topic, he heard the gunshots above quiet for a moment: "End?" he said with a mouth, To Catherine is also to myself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the scene he finally saw, these boys should have taken control of the situation, and the unrelenting blasphemy is indeed as Catherine said Difficult to cope with, the bullet can hardly achieve decisive results on his body - but can limit his actions in a sufficiently dense situation, plus the left and right pinch of the other two abilities, the remaining space is small Allow him to simply move his arms and legs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine said nothing, she put her finger on Abel’s face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sharp and intense fear is transmitted directly from Abel’s cheek to his brain and spinal cord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other half of the action group went after the one who took the child away Big monkeys, even without Abel’s instructions, know that a monkey will not appear in this vast olive grove for no reason, and will not let the bait be galloped from one at a loss or other damn reasons. The car was intercepted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is a circus monkey." One of the pursuers said that he saw the monkey wearing a beautiful vest: "Maybe it thought that It’s a doll.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Do you think that monkey is as stupid as you?” The second chaser, his partner, snorted: “It’s It’s a straight line. Obviously, it’s going somewhere.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rebuttal is not angry: “What do you think there will be waiting for us? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A box of banknotes," the respondent paused: "Or a coffin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; The questioner twisted his lips. I have to say that it is true. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two of them closed their mouths, and others kept silent as always. After all, the two people are best at tracking and chasing, in the dark and damp, no Any path can be said, there are olive groves full of spiked branches everywhere. It’s very difficult to catch up with them. It’s hard to jump on the top of the tree like a monkey. The ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
