			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you like him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I love him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chitz Carson said this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avery. Famo returned after finishing the day’s training. In my bedroom, in the second grade, the students’ bedrooms are much more spacious, but most of the students still have two rooms. He is not very satisfied with this. He believes his roommates think so, but their situation It is only a little better than the freshmen in the first grade. Only the third graders and the fourth graders have the right to be picky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was in a bad state these few days. The coach thought he was upset because he was still a running back substitute. The coach comforted this quite in his eyes. The promising player and promised that he will be a regular player in the third year. He didn't know that Avery was really annoyed that his investigation in Manchester hadn't made any progress at all - his ideal situation of being able to easily get a list of Lions members did not appear, although many seniors boasted that they had been After recruiting - but in the end they had to admit that they were lying under Avery's roots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been said that the Lions will gather all the second-year students in the square, then beat the shoulders of the people they are looking at and shouted: "Follow me." Come!" - Those who are willing to become Lions members will be happy to follow the recruiters, but in fact, this is purely nonsense. The recruitment of Lions has been secret since its inception. They use various kinds. Inviting people in ways that are not known, and the people being recruited never make aloud to make their identity public. Many people will never let others know that they were a member of the Lions Club for the rest of their lives - they And do not want to attract the attention of the outside world. When Avery Famo was too long near a small building that many students thought might be a secret meeting point for the Lions, the coach warned him that if he was so curiously "curious", he had May be driven out of the football team and drive out of Manchester. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a well-known way to get a roster of Lions club members. That is to become their member, each member can get the roster of each member in the past when he graduates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Avery has measured himself. Can he get an invitation from the Lions? Is the answer? Lions members usually have a long-lasting or extremely glorious surname, most of them have backgrounds. Famo is just a farmer, and Avery is the most mundane of the more than a thousand second-year students. If it is not another strong hand that supports Avery Famo in the back, they have long been destroyed. - Avery has also thought about whether he can grab the hand - those people must know who killed Ferrola, but he only tried it, his father was accused of participating in commercial fraud, God knows This honest and traditional man rarely uses credit cards! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avery immediately stopped all actions for up to three months. He only appeared in four places, dormitories, restaurants, classrooms and football fields. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His father was released, but he soon went bankrupt, but fortunately the rest of the money was enough for them to rent an apartment in a small city next to Manchester. Now, Avery’s father is a staff member in a company, and the salary can be said to be unexpectedly good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seeing that person again, Avery couldn’t suppress his anger if they just wanted him to be a student. Then why bother to send him to Manchester, they can throw him to any university, or directly let him be a forklift driver. Thief, addict! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, we don't raise useless people - but that doesn't mean you can stretch your nose and sniff around without permission. That's very annoying, please keep in mind that this is not your job - we let you enter Manchester, first: look at this person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The man reached a photo in front of Avery, and Avery recognized him at once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do he need to see?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Caring for him, loving him." The man said: "Pay attention to his every move - if you can't, pay attention to Besib. Bisangdi. They have a brother-intimate relationship."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Because Sangdi, he will also enter the football team?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He performed well." The man said: "He is more valuable than you. At least, we don't have to pay extra to keep him in the football team."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A straightforward humiliation like this would definitely cause an unpleasant storm or ice in another young boy, but Avery has no longer taken care of it: "But this is... wrong," he is tenacious. Retorted: "You should know that I am applying to Manchester and I don't want to go to school here - I want to know the name of the ball!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" After you know?" The man said, "What do you want? Kill him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know," Avery said. "But I It’s not going to let him spend the rest of his life freely.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“If you can finish your work well in these years, we I will give you some documents." The man said, "We can still give you a lawyer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give me a name." Avery insisted "The man is already in fourth grade. If he doesn't want to continue his studies in Manchester, he will leave here next year." Once left, Ai In virtue of one man is hard to find him, but he does not trust those people, he even called file is also the first time to know. Will they really give it to him, on the premise that he has not been able to use it too much? He doesn't understand politics, but he also knows that politicians never have real enemies and friends. Only the devil knows what it will be for a few years, even after a year—he needs everything he can get now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person was silent for a while, just as quietly as he came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avery returned to the dormitory, there is a folder in his computer, which is the information of the new Sasha Hopkins, Avery is starting school. There was a hunch when I saw him at the ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person brought Avery’s request back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do we really need to do this?" One person said, "A child."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "If Cassandra's prophecy is correct," another said: "He can change the whole world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This world has It’s good enough, or bad enough,” said the third person. “And we’ve had enough power, we, and people like us, we’re going to be good, we don’t need to change.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
