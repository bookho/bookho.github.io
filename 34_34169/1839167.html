			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lilith took another step forward, and the light covering Sasha was obscured by the plump female. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha opened his eyes in the sudden darkness, and in such cases, the point he inherited from Hopkins would be very vividly highlighted. - The child's eyes glow in the dark with red shimmer, like a cat, dog or owl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," Lilith said with fascination: "It’s these eyes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "You are also one of those people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's one of them." Lilithmeer said slyly and slyly: "The first is the alarm, then It was the flame and the explosion, the door opened, and I came out, but for a while, I couldn’t see anything, I couldn’t hear it, the smoke made me breathless, I was on the ground – you walked away from me. In the past, Dr. Hopkins hugged you tightly, the cute little prisoner - I didn't want to escape at first, because I knew that the place was full of savvy and powerful guys, and very rude, very rude (saying here) She shivered a little), but suddenly, a force hit me, hard to imagine, like high/tidal, do you understand, not just between the legs, it is systemic... no No, it should be said that it does not stop in the flesh, it penetrates the bone marrow, infiltrates the nerves, and easily occupies my entire soul. I am comfortable, happy, excited, feeling strong and fearless, and in fact it is, I managed to escape. Although I was scarred, I was free - but that feeling quickly disappeared. I can't find it anymore, tell me, my little angel, my little baby, how can I get it? What do you want? What do your father want? I can give you a lot of things, a lot, a safe , long-term shelter, money, woman, of course, maybe you haven't reached that age, then toys, game consoles and books, how. I know you like reading."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha stared at her, only a faint light, he could know very well, "...What do you want? Lilith." He asked softly: "Speak clearly I don’t understand it completely... or you should go to my father to talk.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Don’t be your father, it’s not your father’s strength. Lilith smiled and said very slyly: "At first I thought it was your father, but Come... someone tells me that it is your power, you use us, you control our emotions and strength, incite us to escape, let us kill, and then easily escape in chaos - you owe us, Sasha Hopkins, and your father, you owe us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have to help me," said Lilith, who slowly lifted one knee and then the other. She slowly climbed into the bed like a female leopard who had successfully captured her prey, her hand. And the feet were deeply stuck in the blanket, the body was shrouded above the sand, her face was down, leaning forward, only one inch away from the child's face, her breath slammed on the face of Sasha: "Help I am standing on my side, high on the top, not the one I want to see, just like today - you should help me to drive away the cockroach / son, instead of watching my jokes next to me - Let your father and Hefner talk about it, let her know how precious, how important, how indispensable, let him be me alone... and, I need that feeling."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you feel?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your strength, the power of Sasha Hopkins. Just like you are doing in the Tower of Babel - let me do everything again, I need this power... Give it to me, dear, let me taste it. I still clearly remember its taste."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The child raised his lips because both front teeth fell, when he made this movement, above the lips There will be a small depression, not obvious, but as long as I find it, I feel very cute... cute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lilith smiled screamingly, the smell she spit out was stinking, dirty, and not good at all, "give me strength," she said. Otherwise I will make you sad - you will be driven out of here, nowhere to hide, and the institution will follow your ass, there will be no hot delicious meals, no warm blankets and beds, no books, no school, no A fixed residence, huddled in a subway station and a park, full of fleas, unkempt, and ugly... you will..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Someone turned on the light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light of the sudden arrival is hard to be welcomed by people, especially when they don’t need this light, Lilith covers her eyes with her palms, squatting The head looks in the direction of entering the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie stood at the door and pressed his finger on the switch of the chandelier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked serious, frowned, without makeup, and did not wear a bunny uniform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This time you should be downstairs," Lilith said angrily. "Is Hefner already kind enough to allow you to work as you wish?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Hefner gave me the job of looking after Sasha Hopkins," Bonnie said, and she let go and walked briskly to the bed: "You are drunk, Miss Lilith, please He was very uncomfortable when he came down from the bed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How much have you heard?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "A lot, Miss Lilith," Bonnie squinted out her arms. "Don't let me do it, it will make a lot of things. You don't want Mr. Hefner to know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lilysmeyer slipped out of bed and didn’t stand steady when she landed. Alcohol was working. She swayed and grabbed the pillar on the bed: "You are not the first bad. "My business," she said, sulking and said: "From Betty to this kid, I said what do you want to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good Let's guess, you care about Betty, except that she has something to do with you - I mean, a woman who is old and old is a little cute girl. Sexual care, there are usually three reasons," she said, sticking out a finger. "1. Put the hope that is least likely to be realized on the same sex that is younger and more beautiful than you, and you want to benefit from her. Control her and control her - it is possible, but I am afraid it will be difficult, because this object may not be so obedient, you may have nothing in the end, but you may have some of her more excellent photos and even videotapes if she can Become a fame overnight or find a football star as a husband - the things you have in your hand will make you comfortable for the rest of your life," stretch out two fingers, "2. Poor little girl is seen by you Her own regeneration, every compliment and success she gets is like someone giving you another, she is just a substitute, a representative, but she can do what you can't do - this may make you very Uncomfortable, but she can also make a big loss for people you can't understand. For example, she may be able to teach me a meal instead of you. You will feel very happy - because you hate me more than she does. You can laugh when you see me fall, you are your accomplice, your weapon; "stretch out three fingers," 3. You are indeed full of love for this girl at no cost, she will not hurt her, I will not marry her. You regard her as a spiritual daughter. Just like raising a bird that you don’t understand, educate her and condone her. You hope that they can live a beautiful and simple life. This is harder than the first two, because what you pay is often hard to get back – or what you expect is hard to achieve. In this world, the so-called beauty and simplicity are too little, but concealed in beauty and simplicity. The desires and darkness are much more than the former. The stupid girls who are simple, shallow, self-interested, always sprint to the objects they are longing for, even if they want to protect those who have protected and loved them. All trampled on the ground, crushed and crushed - she will only suspect that you are in the way, I can't wait for you to disappear overnight. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She took back her fingers. "Come, tell me, Bonnie, which one, or all three?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Sasha, you want What do you get from this child? His father? Indeed, Bonnie, you are old enough, you will want a marriage, a family, and Dr. Hopkins is a gentle, healthy and wealthy person - At least it looks like this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't want it," Bonnie squinted and escorted between her and Sasha: "I Just don't want to see you doing that kind of thing - you are really disgusting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lilith stood in place for a minute, not moving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," she raised a hand: "Well, Knight Bonnie, take care of the little baby, don't let me find the chance." She turned to Sasha: "We will talk next time, when no one is disturbing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lilithe Meyer stepped out of the room and Bonnie immediately went up and closed the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She came in from the window," Sasha said. Lilith's room balcony is next to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie immediately turned to close the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's okay, Bonnie." Sasha said: "She is very annoyed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "As she said, I am too old," Bonnie rolled her lips. "I have already said to Mr. Hefner. I have to go. Mr. Hefner is very generous. He gave me a double. Double the salary and a small amount of bonus, as long as I work hard during this time - for you, dear little gentleman," she went to the bed and bent down to try Sasha's body temperature: "Really Oops, your body temperature is going up again, I have to give you an ice pack."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She quickly came back with an ice pack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With more people in the room, Bonnie was shocked. Fortunately, Lilith, who was not going back, was Mr. Big Hopkins. He took off his jacket, wore his shirt, rolled up his sleeves, and his arms were stronger than expected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you." He took the ice bag and wiped the drops of water on the child's forehead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
