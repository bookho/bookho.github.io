			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shawn Battier’s schedule is almost as accurate as a cesium atomic clock. He gets up at nine every day and does his personal cleaning work and notes for half an hour. After breakfast for a quarter of an hour, he would walk for two hours and three quarters in the casino with his deputy, lunch at 12:30, and repeat the morning after half an hour, but this time only three hours, four o'clock at him. I will return to my room and office, spend two hours processing all kinds of written documents, have dinner at six o'clock, and he will stay in the room after dinner, except for a few who will bring him huge profits and strong support. Other than his good friend, he doesn't see anyone, and he doesn't go anywhere. His subordinates and guests often judge the position of the owner of the Paradise Palace casino by himself when he sees Shane Battier. The later the time, the more you value him – but it should be noted that this time is usually agreed by Sean Battier himself and not by the guests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The green-eyed deputy was a little surprised after receiving a positive reply from Battier, who was smart, cheerful, and sometimes very gentle. People, but he is also very arrogant and self-sufficient. In the impression of the deputy, only a few people can make a decision for Shane Battier so casually. There is no Anthony Hopkins on this list. name. However, this did not prevent him from being more respectful. At 4 o'clock in the afternoon, the service staff sent a cabinet of clothes, from the inside out, from the silk dress of the regular dress and the bow tie of the evening dress, carefully ironed. Finished, they are neatly hung in the closet, stacked in drawers, soft and smooth cotton and satin in the afternoon sun with pearl-like light, shoes, crocodile skin, sheepskin and cowhide, black and White, matt and bright. Hollowed, with laces and no straps, the latter is mostly prepared for the wear of Besib and Sasha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides a pair of white lambskin shoes, it is very loose and soft, and the shoe is decorated with a gold-plated anchor chain. He tried it and found The size is just right, not tight or loose. He tried to put on a French shirt (this shirt is used for formal wear, cut the body), the boy's expression became a bit weird: "How do they know? I said." He showed himself to Sasha New shoes: "Our size?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, this is nothing to be surprised," Sasha said. "I came to see it when I came in. Walkway There is an inductive human body scanner, um, it seems to be the one produced in 2007. It can even record a small tweezers on your butt, and the size of the shoes and clothes is certainly not a problem." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib's face became very delicate, and he frowned. Thinking for two seconds, then saw Sasha turn his head, bastard, he smiled! The boy who found himself being teased rushed over and stumbled on his friends. They were like two little cheetahs who had tasted bloody, and they were twisted together, and Besib was taller than Sasha. But to talk about how to control and restrain others, Sasha Hopkins, who is personally guided by the Ghoul, will surely win him. Dr. Hopkins, who was leaning back on the shirt button and stepping back two steps, almost watched the two little beasts screaming from the end of the house to the head of the house. In the end, Sasha raised his hand to express his surrender. It was not that he could not compete with Besib. After all, this was his head. The breathless Besib used his fist to top his cheek as punishment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, kids. Stop here," Dr. Hopkins said. He has taken care of his head, light gray dress, black and white elegant leather shoes, a pattern of curly grass with hollow holes on the upper, hair combed back, smooth and shiny, he put on a A monocle that is only a strap: "Give you ten minutes." He looked at his watch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do we have to be like that?" Besib smothered Sasha's neck and whispered that Dr. Hopkins's hair was not messy. He is deeply awe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, not like that, but it is not." Sasha grabbed the hair of Beb, and the hair of Besib was with natural curl. The play-like struggles that have just made them become a messy nest. Sasha first climbed up from the carpet and then stretched out and grabbed Beib. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The children’s movements are very fast, Besib sipped in the bathroom and spent half a minute combing his hair, during this time, Sasha gave him clothes that matched the shoes - the shirt was certainly impossible to wear, and the two boys didn't need to be as well-dressed as Hopkins, they just put on loose shirts and trousers. - They are not yet mature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am really not used to wearing white." Besib complained: "I feel very strange, Sasha, I dare to swear, even when I am married." I won't wear it like this..." He thought about the word: "Girly." In fact, he wanted to say if he would look like a buttock, but it was too disgusting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Trust me, you are still the same lion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Whitening?" Besib made a face. "I feel worse." He looked at Little Hopkins: "I like the one on you." All black, from shirts to trousers, and shoes: " I can change my shoes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If there is a power outage, I am afraid I will not find you." In the past three weeks, Besib was swimming in the pool or in the sea almost every day, and the skin that was suffocated and whitish by the football protective suit did not take long to change back. The color of the pickled olives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishb shrugged and looked at the time, he thought, and Sasha Hopkins’s dress was not good enough, he It looks like a black monk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shawn Battier is not pulling like other casino owners On the outskirts of Vegas, that is, choosing or building a home in a residential area, his home is located on the seventh floor of the Paradise Palace Hotel, and his casino is on the first to sixth floors of the hotel. He is like a dragon that never leaves the cave, firmly entrenched in his treasure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only one of the hotel’s nine elevators that leads to the seventh floor, and requires a password and Battier’s personal permission. The seven-story entrance to the electric chair is not unusual. Visible narrow corridor or elevator, but a circular open hall, the top of the hall is decorated with a spiral chandelier composed of numerous crystal glass tubes, the walls are covered with cold velvet wall coverings, under the feet The thick carpet is brightly colored - the sapphire blue background, with the dense gold and pink wheel pattern, Bessie blinks, and in the short memories before lunch, Hopkins once mentioned In the ancient Romans, the wheel pattern symbolizes the endless wealth, so many of the floors in the casino use this pattern, it is difficult to know, the wealth brought by this pattern is falling into the gambling. The guest's pocket still fell into the pocket of the casino owner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the door opened, Besib and Sasha faintly heard the sound of "Dangdang, Dangdang Dangdang", this voice seems to There will only be one kind of machine, which is the most common Mac here. The music it plays is both monotonous and boring, but it is still fascinating by countless people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exchange coins, jingle, Dangdang, cast a corner, jingle, Dangdang... jingle, Dangdang, top light Rotating and shining, congratulations, you won! When the coin is filled with the coin outlet, come again? Of course, good luck is hard to see. You can't give up this opportunity. The "Performance" Mac is only a penny for each minimum bet, but few people are so few. The gamblers can be on the machine. Sitting all day, not eating or drinking, just pulling the pole desperately, the machine slamming, like a whip slaps their hearts, forcing them to take out the last penny in their pockets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
