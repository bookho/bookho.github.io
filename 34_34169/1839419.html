			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyone in the other room heard an angry roar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bezib, like a sudden storm, usually rolled out of the room, and he took out his gun when he strode forward, with the muzzle facing down. The sound of pulling insurance is clear and pleasant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How did it come?" he asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QiZi didn’t even lift her head. She didn’t have even one inch on her body. She said she heard the words of Besib and could understand the meaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib took her a slap in the face and fired a shot at her knee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;President Miss Cason fell down in sorrowful sorrow, and the sea gods used a large-caliber gun, too close, her The calves are almost completely detached from the body, the bones burst open, fresh blood is sprayed onto the floor, and their sweet smell, along with the smell of feces, causes everyone around them (except for the completely absent-minded Besib) to frown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib asked again, but the pain has taken away all the attention of Chiz Carson, he took a step forward and stepped on that Only the calves, the sticky flesh are immersed in the urine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb| an][shu][ba].sp; Chiz wants to escape more pain, she turns her head and tries to grab her leg So lucky to hear the third question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her pupil is like a coin, but she has been able to recognize Besib, and she is familiar with the face that has been repeatedly washed by tears. The expression, as if the soul finally returned to this body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not me," she screamed again, and replied like a gasp: "It’s Catherine, it’s Catherine got it... I got Sasha’s ...jy! From that Smith!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give her medicine." Besib said: "Good medicine."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp brought some narcotic pain relievers, and his gesture for the injection of Chiz Carson was brisk and arrogant. In the process of injection, he nodded to Besib, indicating that it had been mixed with scopolamine (a thing called a vomiting agent, people may not all tell the truth under its anesthesia, but that Only for trained people). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib waited for ten minutes for the anesthetic to work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cause of the whole incident was not deliberately - after the two women reached a temporary alliance, Catherine received a small task at the Manchester Medical School. Dr. Smith, who worked for him, got something that he shouldn't have (oh, maybe a lot of people have forgotten it, the piece of metal that was handed over to him by Boa Douglas, with blood and tissue fluid , visceral debris. There is a small epididymis). Dr. Smith was excited to find that there was still a living mature sperm in the epididymis, although the number was scarce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His home is a small biological laboratory, but some of the more critical parts still need to be completed in the lab of Manchester Medical School, and some of them Important details need to be queried and discussed. There are too few samples in his hand. Time is tight. And before I knew nothing about the abilities, the hacker members of the organization were not aware of the wrong things from his vague questions. The daring Mr. Smith was really quick and they broke. When you enter. He already has fifteen healthy and fertilized eggs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The task given by the agency was to bring back everything, but Catherine got too much information from Mr. Smith, she took the opportunity to turn this old bastard into The idiot and the first step to get the box containing the fertilized egg, and "inadvertently lost" it in the next moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She found Chiz Carson, of course, the whole process that Chiz Carson had imagined was probably reversed, but I don’t think it would be a little girl. Too careful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you think he will marry you with a child from Sasha?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bie West Bu said that his tone steadily chills. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chiz Carson smiled (God, she could still laugh), "Why? Do you think he will? He is so gentle , traditional, responsible and compassionate, he knows that his future wife will not be a Westerner, so he does not date any girl who is not a Poseidon, because it will hurt their hearts, even if Only a few hours, he is not willing - do you think he will be the kind of person who sets his own child and the mother of the child?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" He won't," Besib said. "So you got such a monster?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chiz Carson was blank for a moment: "Don't call it a monster," she said shamelessly. "Your brother will be upset." The narcotics worked out completely. She went to pull her calf: "I don't want to It generates this way - we have to hide from other people, institutional people, your people, my classmates, my mother, my uncle, my grandfather, you, and Sasha and his father - we I haven't done too much inspection. I didn't have it in the last five months. I gave it to the bathtub that is only four feet long. Catherine wants to kill it, but I don't want it - its lung capacity is still very good. Cry, you can make a noise to the top six neighbors, and its skin. Do you want to peel it off to make a lampshade? Just put it in your living room," she giggled. "Your The guests will be amazed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand." Besib simply replied: "Pray, Carson."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gun with a little temperature also held the forehead of Chiz Carson. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chez Carson faintly looked at Besib for a while, when she realized that the man was not joking or threatening, she was loud Screaming, going backwards, and trying to use the meaningless scratching and tapping to push the hand in front of the deadly weapon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, no. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib listened for a while, the sensitive ear of the abilities made him very uncomfortable, Chiz Carson did not regret, pray, she just Repeat her surname in incoherently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am Douglas!" she cried. "I am still a Carson! You can't kill a Carson..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, no. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "May the Lord forgive you, Amen." Besib whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, no. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In addition, I have already killed a Carson, Carson."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No Do not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharp little tentacle -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bullet penetrated the front skull and flew out. Behind the head left a big hole like John Carson. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Screams are coming to an end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharp little tentacle -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishb raised a hand, gently In the temple that jumped straight, he did not close the gun, but returned to the room where the baby was placed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The curtains are open, and the obese little mites are squirming in the cotton pile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A yellow-green, unscented, turbid water ejected from a small hole that was not seen by Besib, covered by a film of meat. The height of the Yang is very high, and the gauze and the bed board are dirty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, no. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharp little tentacle -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beibb looked down at it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, no. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Soon," Besib promised: "You won't feel pain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;No, no. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go live and live. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib is aiming at it. Compared to the trauma that the bullet will cause. How small is this terrible little head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, no, no. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More little tentacles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;我我我我. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stay alive...live and live...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dad and Dad! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib’s hand trembled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A small tentacle that is difficult to count. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha Hopkins is the fortress built by Besib. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No no no no no no no no no no no no! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Save me, save me, save me, save me, save me, save me, save me! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad and Dad! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gunshots shook the entire room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bep has never been so agile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He entered the room a little later than Besib, and then he saw the young leader raise the gun in his hand, and there were five to six steps between them. The distance, he almost jumped without thinking. Grabbed the legs of Besib. Drop him on the carpet. And on the next second, he climbed onto his back and tried to hold him down. Just less than a foot on his head, the black bullet holes were glowing with blue smoke. Baby, okay, for the time being a baby, at least it cries like a baby, and its crying is simply earth-shattering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait," Beep yelled. "Wait, you can't - Besib, that's the children of Hopkins!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mixed!" Besib yelled: "They made it, just to use it to humiliate my brother!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood up, relaxed as if he was not so personal, Beep smirked on his shoulder, clutching his arm, feeling that he was weighing a ton The bull is more aggressive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even that!" Baptist retorted: "I can't - only his father can kill him - remember our rules, only Father can decide the fate of the child, you can't, you are not Sasha Hopkins!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let the hell go!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let your friendship go to hell?" Beppe yelled at Besib's ear: "In order to gain the trust of others, do you know how much Sasha did? You have to ruin it all." ?! Others can not care what the problem with this child, they only know that you killed him and killed the first child of Sasha!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dad, Dad, Dad and Dad Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad and Dad! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A consciously patted the brain of Besib, he gasped and turned away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha Hopkins stood at the door of the room, he did not wear a jacket, he might have rushed from another place, the tie was untied, thin blue The top button of the white striped shirt has no buckle, and the lower edge of the blue-gray pants is covered with sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You look bad, Besib."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib pushes open Pu (actually, as early as the time when Sasha appeared, Beppe had already released his arm), he opened his mouth and had warm liquid flowing into his mouth, and he discovered that he had already tears. Flowing up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The group of bitch-raising, 婊(子--mixed things, the next three abuses..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"I know," Hopkins said, and he came over and hugged his brother: "I know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They ruined him and ruined him..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;( To be continued)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following chapter notice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is too nervous," Sasha said: "He has never had the opportunity to relax."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really." Beppe said with sincerity.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a one percent time," Besib said tiredly: "I will steal, for the money, status , vanity and rights, I am happy that my father is dying, I will calculate how much benefit his death can bring to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
