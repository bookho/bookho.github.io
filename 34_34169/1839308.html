			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day of Easter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie is a young police officer. When she walked into the office, she passed an old woman and she saw the old woman tightening her hands. Holding a photo tightly, good vision made her recognize the girl in the photo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The notice on the cork wall is also nailed with the same photo. More than a month ago, around 4 pm, the girl was only eight years old. The bicycle departs from home and buys ice cream and eggs from another block convenience store less than five hundred feet away, and then never returns. Her grandmother asked all the girls, friends and teachers she knew, no one had seen her. One neighbor said that she saw her riding into the street park, but no one saw her coming out of the street park. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They found bicycles that were discarded in the bushes in the street park. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immediately release the girl’s personal message to the whole country through radio, TV, email, traffic alert, SMS, k, google, etc. This early warning system Thousands of children have been saved in five years, but this time it has completely failed. The girl disappeared silently like a dew that was exposed to the sun and evaporated. The police and community volunteers helped her grandmother print out 150,000 tracing notices posted every day. Before the weather forecast, the TV station would insert a short video, and the girl’s grandmother begged on television to help her find the only relative in the world—her husband died at the young age, her son did, Less than a year after getting married, the girl’s mother committed suicide because of depression. Little Sarah was her last hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old woman with white hair shows the audience the purple heart medal her husband received. He saved five people on the battlefield; her son’s medal of honor, It was personally issued by the President, the husband’s photo of the military uniform, the photo of his son wearing a police uniform, his wedding photo, and the photos of the girl from small to large. She begged the criminal who took the girl away - if you haven't hurt her yet, please don't hurt her, if you have hurt her, please don't kill her. As long as her granddaughter can return to her side, she is willing to pray to God, may he not be punished for doing so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as she can come back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl’s father’s former partner is now sitting next to Bonnie, drinking a lot of black coffee. He was handsome, but this month is cumbersome. Heavy work and ubiquitous pressure tormented him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie also poured herself a cup of coffee. She took the picture of the child today and asked no less than 300 people, restaurant reception, mobile vendors. The doorman of the hotel, the tramp in the subway station, the staff of the gas station, the volunteers of the relief station... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The photo in her hand was firmly nailed back to the cork wall, except for the girl. There is also a boy, blond, seven years old this year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time of the boy’s disappearance was only a few days away from the girl, and her mother was House Member Vera Davis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vila. Davis is a single mother. Because she needs to travel, she gives her son to her niece, and her child is her niece. Reported case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her niece said at the beginning. The child ran out while sleeping at night, but soon found the opposite evidence in the surveillance video, the child was brought out by her, and finally she was forced to tell the truth - her boyfriend accidentally Two tickets for the Black Pound Club were found in the mailbox. The resident band of that club was her favorite, so when her boyfriend came to ask her, she agreed without much consideration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She bribed the boy who was about to go to sleep with a piece of chocolate. He also bribed the club's guard with twenty dollars and brought the child into the club. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The band was very noisy, but the child soon became drowsy. She put him in a chair to let him sleep and danced with his boyfriend. How long has it been? She remembered that she was not very clear. She only knew that when she returned to her seat, she found that the child was gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FBI intervened in the case that day, after they were allowed, they installed a monitor in the House of Representatives’ office and on the home phone, as well as on nearby public phones. The installation set up a rapid response squad and arranged two fully armed surveillance vehicles. They sincerely hope that this is a professional kidnapping case for a ransom. It is very likely that there is no need for anything else. Tickets for the two black pound clubs alone can indicate that the kidnappers were premeditated rather than temporary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House of Representatives prepared a ransom of about two million yuan, which is a small ticket of 10 yuan, 20 yuan and 50 yuan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s been thirty-two days now, they haven’t received a call. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie finished the cup of the more bitter coffee, went to the tea room and went to the cup to clean it. When she returned to the office, she saw that the former partner was answering the phone. She thought that his face was bad enough. I didn't expect it to continue to fail so quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She already has a hunch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Girl’s father’s partner put down the phone and turned to face her: “They found Sarah,” he choked and said: “She... died. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A series of car accidents occurred on the 8th freeway. Fortunately, no one was killed or injured, and the loss was not great. When asked, one of the men and women showed up. Very suspicious, suspected that they were stealing drugs, and found a girl's body in the trunk while searching the vehicle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next thing happened, no one could think of it. In further interrogation, the men and women confessed that they were working for the boss of a children’s boxing gambling game. The job is to adopt orphans who are said to have come from several regions in the north, and then sign an agreement to send them to the boxing ring. Once the child dies, they are responsible for taking the bodies and going to a designated hospital to open a death certificate - but they I don't think I was abducting and kidnapping Sarah. They gave a phone number - that is, the person gave the child to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to this phone number, I quickly found the person. The guy was indeed from the north. It was originally a pimp who was responsible for the "chicken". He also firmly denied The kidnapping charge, he admitted that there were a group of orphans handed over to him, but it was indeed some orphans. He saw the picture of Sarah that he showed him. It was awkward. In his impression, there was no such thing. little girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the girl is indeed Sarah. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FBI, which has been suffering for more than 30 days in vain, is like a wild boar that smells truffles. They are more than Lafayette. Familiar with these guys from the north, they dig down this line and dug out Abby and his gym without any effort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They found the son of Davis’s congressman, the blond boy, who was dead, just on Easter night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Abby is prosecuted for kidnapping and murder. Without an accident, his sentence will last for two hundred years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"D. Davis has submitted the latest proposal, and if it can be passed, then the entire Western Confederation, fifty-six, In the 320 districts, the children’s boxing competition will be completely banned.” Sasha said: “The proposal was raised and Davis’ voted against it because she thought it would affect the taxation of Lafayette. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So she must be crazy now and want to promote this bill." Besib said: "People also expressed support, including Lafayette." "Special people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are willing to spend a hundred dollars to watch other children's children killed alive," Sasha said indifferently: "but not I will be happy to see my child’s inexplicable disappearance one day, and it will be found in the hospital’s morgue.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the original three missing children People finally established a nationwide "code adam" store child safety alert system with Ambow Alarm system that, unfortunately, Sarah and the boys will be the cornerstone of this bill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faces of girls and boys are taking turns on TV screens. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha. Hopkins picks them up, they are sacrifices and sacrifices. These children are sure to be murdered. Only a few people, pimps, coaches, and Abby can be seen. These people can be seen by Sasha Hopkins, one of the collaborators and investors. It is very easy for him to confuse their senses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two children. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will remember them," Sasha whispered. "Every night, I close my eyes and it must be these two faces." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Abby was sentenced to 267 years and he will be in He served his sentence in the most severe prison in the region. After half a year, he unfortunately provoked a dangerous guy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He mourned for a few hours in the toilet. When people pulled him out of the toilet, he found that every bone in his body was crushed. Broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
