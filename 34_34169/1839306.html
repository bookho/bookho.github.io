			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Writing in front - how to say it, first of all, thank you for your continued commitment to me. After all, I am a writer who always loves to eat words, and the situation and The reason is not to say for a moment, and the promise is not fulfilled. When I come back with apologies, I find that there are still adults who are rewarding and paying attention. My feelings are hard to describe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About rewards, I will look for another opportunity to open a special thank you. If there are any omissions, please remind me in the book review on the same day, thank you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the book review, I recently saw Shen Hao, color painting 枭 comments of two adults, you feel very keen, let me breathe a sigh, because I Can't write the whole process too detailed, it becomes spoiler - please remember that Anthony Hopkins and Chegaler Bisangdi were not good people from a long time ago (Tantaros Adults say very well, they are law-abiding evils, and some of their ideas are very similar to those of parents who keep traditional ideas. They love their children very much. They don’t want their children to be in cruel reality (or they I thought that the blood in front of me would come to accept the lesson. They would rather poke the cruel truth into the eyes of the children, forcing them to accept their own arrangements and take a flat and safe road. The means they use are very likely. It’s a crime, even if it hurts your child, but they are really good for the children (this is really familiar, isn’t it?). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is any difference between Sangdi and Hopkins, it is better than Sangdi to give up Besib and Hopkins will not, but Huo What Pushins can do is more terrible than him. In 215 you can see that Sasha was shocked by his father. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Sasha and Besib are very painful, because they love their father, but their nature is not bad, they have their own bottom line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What Hopkins and Bissand are doing now is to oppress the bottom line of these two children, because in the eyes of these two adults, Sasha and Besib is no different from looking for a dead end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Anthony Hopkins will let Sasha go to seduce Chiz Carson (speaking here, a little spoiler. Chiz Carson The reason why he was left behind was not just to save a living.) Besib tried in advance and killed John Carson. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abby’s boxing gambling is the first “work” for two children. No matter whether it is Besib or Sasha, you can't do it because you are killing people by killing and working hard. They have to do it well, otherwise they will find it more than Sangdi and Hopkins. Do things that are unacceptable to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, children know the means of father best, so they must be very cautious. As for this caution, Sasha has received an important reminder that we will talk about it later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tantalus said that this is the little secret of the "daughter" - this little secret is much more terrible than the scores and early love, and Hopkin Dad will never cry with his hands and he is a decisive person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional, thunder, adults suggested that I have no inspiration to see the US drama Hannibal, huh, huh. The picture is too beautiful, I can't look at it - it will affect my outline. I only watched a few tidbits and selected plots. Hey, Hannibal inside has really done rose ham! ! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The color is beautiful and delicious! ! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally thank you again! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note: This is modified after the release, so these will not count the number of words, please rest assured. - The testimony can only write five hundred words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;224<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The water in the heated swimming pool is always maintained at 26 to 28 degrees. The fresh air from the ventilation ducts was cold. Sasha Hopkins poked out of the pool and was washed by the water. The hair then covered his beautifully shaped skull like a golden helmet. He Breathing gently, the coach reported his new score, which was 0.1 second higher than yesterday. The boy nodded to him and thanked him. Swim to the escalator on one side. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he walked to the locker room, the coach reminded him to go to his office two hours later - half a hour of technical special training every day with underwater video. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no one in the locker room. Five minutes later, Sasha came out of the shower and he saw Boa. Douglas sat on the bench for changing clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a Christmas, Boa is even thinner. The skin is gray, black hair, and a pair of blue eyes deep in the eye socket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where did Catherine go?" he asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She left." Sasha said that he only had a white bath towel around his waist. "The work here is over. She is gone." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where is she now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know." Sasha said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Boa’s blue eyes flashed a vicious and untrusted light: “You lie.” He hoarsely condemned: “You can’t possibly not know Because..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because she loves me." Sasha interrupted him with annoyance, which is very rare in Hopkins. "Of course. But I don't want to know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence completely angered Douglas, he jumped up from the bench and threw himself into Sasha, falling together Into the narrow shower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boa’s strength is great. He grabs Sasha’s shoulder and presses him tightly on the cold and rough marble floor. The pressure switch of the sprinkler head, the water washed down from the top, Boa was soaked in an instant, the black hair fell down, the water flowing down into the eyes of Sasha, Sasha turned his head and closed eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He felt the slate under his back tremble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A black vine was drilled out of the crevice of the slate, so thick as a finger, it wrapped around the sanding neck and forced back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baoer giggled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can kill you," he gasped and said: "I can, I am Douglas...and what are you? You don't even name Carson, You are a hybrid, I can kill you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Idiot!" A voice said in his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indescribably severe pain hit Boa. Douglas - radiates from one point to the whole body, it bites him, every part, belly, stomach, The heart, legs, and hands were torn apart, and his brain was inserted into a red-hot spoon. All things - Sasha Hopkins, light, water, and stone floor were boiling in an instant. stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Idiot." Sasha said that he broke the tree vine that was still wrapped around his neck, stood up against the wall, and made a treasure. The person stayed in the shower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boa. Douglas probably only fainted for two or three minutes, and when he woke up, he was soaked. The body is cold, the hands and feet are numb, and the muscles are slightly twitched because of excessive tension. He can only breathe with his mouth. The look that fell on the ground would be reminiscent of a sea snake that was hooked up by the hook. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The well-dressed Hopkins sat on the bench and looked at him quietly, as he had done before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How about the memories of Christmas?" Hopkins said: "You brought back the final grades? Mr. Foggs Douglas felt it again. Satisfied? I don't think. You hit you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black-haired boy cringed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How did he hit you? Slap your face, or take a belt? Mr. Douglas failed to attend high school in Grand, his youth was in a strict The harsh boarding school spent, the teachers there still retain the right to corporal punishment students today, they use the birch branches to hit the student's ass, did Mr. Douglas take it home? Or have five heads or nine The whip of the head? It is the kind of whip made of cotton cloth, which is about two feet in length. This design makes it used to tear the skin. Each knot has three knots. In the 18th century prison, the jailer used this beat. Prisoner's ass - Did he smoke you? Have you screamed at his feet like a puppies that are being abused?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your mother How is it? Are you more important than her nail polish? When Mr. Douglas is jealous of you, is she watching it? Maybe your barking can keep her high/tidal?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, yes," Hopkins is cold Said: "Your name is Douglas."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He stood up and left the locker room without returning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's it?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His father, Mr. Douglas, will accompany him for a while," Sasha said. "Relive the good memories every night."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Abby compromised," Besib said. "We can arrange up to five people in each gym."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Enough." Sand turned and listened carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Grand Middle School will have spring break in mid-March, we have ten days. During this time, Crowe’s people will send goods. 'Come here.' Besib said in a voice that is difficult to discern. The way they deal with Abby may inadvertently speed up the trip they don't want to see. "Abby promises us that he will be in a month." Train them well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spring break in March is the most desirable holiday for the children of the Western Confederation. After a long and boring winter. And intensively took two months of class. They can finally enjoy it. They may camp, ride, race, and ski with friends. Going to the beach for fun, partying, drinking, going to a health club or museum, accepting tennis and golf entry training; at the same time, coming from a car in the north, waiting for the same age with their children of the same age or younger They will be killed alive sooner or later, because those who have spent a hundred tickets will want to see this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to say to me?" Besib hinted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha hesitated, and a little restless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Or not tonight?" Besib said: "Sorry, I forgot that you have a technical training session today, you should be very tired." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not tired at all," Sasha said. "...just tonight." A vague idea is in his heart like a spider. He gradually formed like that, but he didn't want to let it go to other people to see it, even he didn't want to see it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will give you a cup of iced mint water." Besib said: "It seems that you need this."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib walked out of Sasha’s room, and Beppe was coming in from the outside: “Good evening,” said the young dad, respecting: “Beyond Sandy, Hopkins is in his In the room?" He did not wait for the inquiry from Besib, and then said: "Mr. Anthony Hopkins is waiting for him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Hopkins sat in the sleek black rattan chair, wearing a cherry-colored plain silk shirt, brightly colored, but complemented by deep maroon washed cotton trousers. His feet are bare, the blue veins are on the pale skin, the ankles are very thin, and the front of the wicker chair is double Moroccan leather slippers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want some iced mint water?" he suggested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natural soda, Anthony Hopkins himself has a little mint that can be smashed directly into the bottle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Sasha drank the ice mint water that was not made by Besib but by his father. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The old people of Poseidon Island praised Besib, and you are greatly praised," this is the opening words of Anthony Hopkins, but he is very Obviously absent-minded: "They think that Cloven has a very heavy slap in the face, and Abby has also received the lesson."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If that finger The man with four thorny rings is the one that Anthony Hopkins recognizes, and Sasha thinks that things will not be that simple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kloin and Bisangdi by phone, than Sangdi decided to give him a percentage point, no, not our two percentage points, Abby is very Willing to help us pay this amount.” Dr. Hopkins said happily: “In addition, Konstantin Kloof decided to raise the price of each girl to two thousand dollars, and the boy to two thousand two hundred yuan. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Abby will go crazy." Sasha shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They can't ask for it." Dr. Hopkins said: "But Abby is not going crazy, although he is stupid, but he knows how to be patient. Catherine asks you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is she?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Very good." Hopkins smiled slightly: "And Lila, she also asked you." He saw his son very savagely licking his teeth, let him want to touch his little teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that Lila has not given you a good impression."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
