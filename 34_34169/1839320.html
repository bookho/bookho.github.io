			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The locust is hiding in her armpit, even if the cheeks are close to the arm, it is hard to see, only touched, almost all drilled in, touch Going up is soft, Lila closes her eyes, she knows that it has already filled her blood, the white body is inflated, and the deep rose red that reveals the dead blood from it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stroked it with her fingertips, looking for its eight little feet, her feet moving, the monastery at night was so quiet, the breathing was clearly discernible, she Touching the locust, studying its position, her nails have never been cut, she held the piece of flesh and dig hard - the locusts twisted and shouted - Lulu, Billy, Marianne, they stood in the dark and looked at her with concern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it out? No, Lila's fingers are covered with blood, and there is a lot of blood. She gets up from the bed, her toes step on the cold, hard stone floor, and the silvery moonlight casts on her through the little, towering window. On the body, the cross is hanging on the wall. Jesus crucified is looking at her. Looking at the bleeding girl, she looks down at her hand, groping for the wound, tearing it carefully, and the blood leaves the wound. It is Black, cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It slid through the place where Jesus had been stabbed, slipping over her hip bone, licking the groin, damping thick hair, dew Dew burst up, the women of Stronge used to burn them with matches, because this is a symbol, the blood continues to infiltrate, condenses at the end of the hair, and then squats down the thigh, Marianne laughs in the darkness, saint Jared wants her to be a Strange Jacob, but her body has never been taken by any one of Strong, she escaped, and a long-distance truck driver is willing to take her to the next city. The price is her virginity, the blood is dry on her knees, and it has already healed, but Billy always remembers that it will be broken once on each fasting day. Lira thought that as long as she could kill Jared Strange, she could end her nightmare, only they knew it was impossible, in their In the dream, the blood is filled with the farms, mines, rivers, houses and churches of Stronge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stood on the ground, looked up, the blood stopped, the flesh squirmed and connected, she wiped her body with the alcohol cotton she carried, and Pain, but it has reached a point where it can be ignored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lila quickly fell asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her dreams are full of blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a very short dream, she was awakened by screams and gunshots, and Lila got up from the bed and quickly put on her clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone slammed the door outside, Lila stepped back while opening the door, and the monk in black robes was rudely pushed in, followed by him Two tall soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even a room for a noble woman, there is no unnecessary furnishings and furniture, a small wooden bed, a small table for prayer and writing , 跪 pad, tin kettle, um, you understand, a ceramic chamber pot. There was a cross and an icon on the wall, no lights were turned on, but the moonlight was bright enough, and everything was clear at a glance. One of the soldiers ordered the monk and Lila to stand at the other end of the room, and his companion walked over to check the lila’s backpack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They all carry guns, not a common hunting shotgun, but a no-attack assault rifle, which is the case for the adult men of Stronge The guns, they used such guns to fight wolves and wild goats, and to fight the pagans and fallen people who dared to escape from their palms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a light rose was thrown out, the monk turned his eyes away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lila’s backpack has nothing special, she and the monk were driven to a cross under the arch, and the dean, other silent monks The Boy Scouts stood together, the head of the team and the instructor were among them. The head of the head was bleeding, and Charlie was close to his father. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The swaying lights are hung under the arch, and the light is dark and uncertain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These uninvited guests have apparently been carefully camouflaged - their cadpat digital camouflage and tactical vests were officially retired from the military 20 years ago, many They can be found in gun shops or outdoor sporting goods stores; their weapons, g36c short assault rifles, famas f1 no-attack assault rifles, l22a1 carbine and glock17 pistols - these dangerous gadgets, as long as you have enough money on your hand It can be bought at any gun shop, sporting goods and department store in nearly 30 districts, or even a temporary gun show. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The management of the guns in the 13th district is more relaxed than the neighboring regions. These people are seen as long as they have guns. With the permit and the hunting permit, you can leave the big swing and ask them to put the gun into the bag at most. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
