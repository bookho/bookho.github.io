And also No one can prove that she is not talking nonsense!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, Lila," said the young man who controlled the computer, "Don't be so violent - you should I am happy, we have found the goal, and the next thing is much simpler... Patience, baby, I don’t like sand.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I hope things are as simple as you said," Lila stood up and walked around the room. The heels were adorned with metal pieces. When they walked on the carpet, they would still go to the ground screen. The buzz is really distracting: "It’s obvious that the Yankee still wants to make a big profit." She suddenly stopped: "How much do you think she can value? 'Head'? Ten million, Still 20 million? I guess the man's appetite will not be small, look at their bet!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp; "If it does not exceed 500 million, the organization will consider it." "Header" said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s incredible," Lila said indignantly: "She is much more expensive than me!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expression of red hair Judah suddenly became a bit subtle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because her abilities are quite mature and useful," said the "head", who took a orange-flavored toffee in his mouth. After chewing a few times, I swallowed it directly. "The 'institution' is now in short supply. We need more, I mean, the abilities who have not been discovered and controlled - but you also know that the general abilities They are often the same as ordinary people before the first time, and there is no reliable device to identify them - and she is the only person we know today that can accurately identify the abilities, even if he - she is a With the network of trackers, as long as she has her, we can gather more fish. And..." "Head" glanced at Lila, with a kind of gentleness that can be said to be rare for him. The tone said: "For some minors who have not yet awakened, early detection may have saved their lives." So far. There are still many people who think that the abilities are all demons, morphs, and thugs that are inhuman. This view cannot be said to be completely wrong. There are indeed some abilities who want to do whatever they want through their own special abilities, but they must not It’s right – some conservative areas or devout believers will try to expel and kill the abilities, especially those who show their abilities for the first time or for the second time, but fail to master it. Many of the "newbies" are still ignorant children. They don’t even know what happened to them, they were beaten, shot and even buried alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lila closed her mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shawn Battier has been listening and watching with great interest. Then he raised a hand in a timely manner: "Oh, look, he is already asking."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Dear Hopkins." Ivan shouted sweetly, his eyes moving from the upper Hopkins to the ground, then from the ground to the Baccarat table, and finally from the desktop to the little Hopkins: "I hate a lot of people, But it's a pity. They are not here now, but fortunately there is you - I hate you, Hopkins - I see you still have a gun, this is good, do you think we should play the game just now? He gently lifted his finger up: "Pick up the gun and press the trigger. It's very simple - you can point to anyone, my little black wife, your son. Your affectionate wife, you Son's friend, you...yes," he laughed and ate. "And me, this is the best choice. But you have to be careful, the things in my hands can make us all fly out of the earth." - Of course. The one that doesn't make a chunk."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where are you from? This madman? "Battier said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not us," "head" patiently replied: "It’s Samuel."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Anger? (Samuel is one of the angels, seven sins represent anger)" Battier said, he waited for a while, did not get an echo, knowing that the other party temporarily did not want to explain too much with him. Although he and the organization can be said to be cooperative, he wisely converted a topic: "What are you going to do? I mean, what is the situation now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I thought Anthony Hopkins was your friend."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am just an ordinary person," Battier replied very quickly: "I There is nothing you can do about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"訇!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great noise makes all the screens in front of the monitor People were shocked, Lila almost fell to the ground, and the "head" was almost infarcted by an almond nougat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened?!" "Head" immediately shouted at the microphone: "Abel, answer me!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the monitor screens were filled with white fog, and several screens turned black—the monitor probe was destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while - probably the time to drink a cup of coffee, the other end of the communicator finally came the voice: "'Head'?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am at."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Things have been solved." Abel said: "They are all Still alive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." "Head" bit the piece of nougat that almost murdered him: "Very good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abel closed the communicator and walked out from behind the curtain. He knew that the "head" was disappointed, things had been resolved, but they still didn't figure it out... What is the power of Anthony Hopkins? Is his ability an attack or an aid? Which is the file from a to g? What are the restrictions? What is the maximum impact range? Can control be a way to counteract this ability? They are ignorant of the unification - the "institutional" research department has made some speculations - from the ability of Sasha, he should inherit and integrate the abilities of both parents, which can help other abilities expand The ability to enhance abilities is rare and precious, but it can only be divided into pure auxiliary ability - his ability can't directly hurt others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Hopkins seems to be the same at first glance. In the FBI case, he has hardly used the power to transcend the concept of ordinary people. His strength is extraordinary, and the speed is like a vampire, but many abilities can do this - some people suggest that Hopkins' ability may be very close to mental control or interpretation. But if this is said, the "institution" in the g-zone of the Tower of Babel, the fortified cell that had been imprisoned by Little Hopkins and completely torn and destroyed, is difficult to make a reasonable explanation - on-site restoration experts and Researchers have done hundreds of inspections and analyses on almost every piece of debris, and still can't draw a tangible conclusion. The "head" who was forced to leave the "Babel" is no longer able to understand everything inside, as he used to. He can only get information about the leftovers from above, for example, that can resist the piercing of armor. The glass walls of bombs and powerful bombs were shattered "evenly", like the effect of someone hitting a hammer with thousands of dwarves in half a second or even less. The force on the wall is very stable and average, and the recycling is very timely. The debris of the wall is glued to the ground with a width of only one foot or so. There is no sporadic small spot in other places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
