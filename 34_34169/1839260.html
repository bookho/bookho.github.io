			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ivan Sergeyevich’s head is a little shorter than Anthony Hopkins, but feels stronger, his face and The body is full of angularity, from the brow bone to the lower jaw, from the shoulder to the hip bone, from the finger to the toe, the black silk satin evening dress on his body is like being wrapped around a huge steel ingot. Instead of wearing it on a human being. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He extended his hand to Dr. Hopkins, his hand was furry, covered with pale yellow ochre hair, and his nails were deeply trimmed. Almost embedded in the meat. Hopkins took his hand, Ivan's hand was surprisingly hot, but there was no sweat, and Hopkins's hand was as cold as he had just taken it out of the ice water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baccarat’s table is far from other gambling, and in addition to chips, it can also use cash, so it can be said to be the most exciting and direct in the entire casino. Although everyone knows that chips are money, a glimpse of plastic wafers and scented inks that squeaks and squeaks are completely different, especially for some daring VIPs. When they are desperately desperate, they are so swaying, like a cheap napkin made in a supermarket promotion, they are put on the table in a whole package. It takes only a few minutes to shuffle, cut, and deal. If you want a card or don't, in just a few rounds, your personal assets can be doubled easily – of course, you may have to watch them be embraced by others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone who can enter the "Tianqiu" rarely gambles on this table, the minimum bet of this table is determined to be 100,000 yuan. No limit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The table manager personally opened the blood-red velvet chain for Ivan and Hopkins, let them walk into the entrance, erect around the table Polished copper railings, railings are at least three to four feet away from the table. They don't seem to be strong, but if someone who is too obsessed or fanatical wants to go further, the guards who guard it will appear right next to him or her – they are usually dressed in black. vest. The white shirts are well-faced, tall, and extraordinarily strong, but in general, they are only gentle reminders. After all, this is the "sky ball" gathered by VIPs, not the "paradise palace" mixed with fish and dragons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were sitting in the three and four positions respectively, they did not use cash, they used chips. The casino staff who acted as "bookkeepers" washed the cards (a total of six decks), then asked a neighbor (gambler) to cut the cards and placed them in the licensing box of the black hibiscus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the start. The gambler who served as the dealer announced that the amount of the bet was 100,000 yuan. The young man in the first seat said "all", which means he is willing to bet, then the old man of the second seat, the third and fourth seats. It is Ivan and Hopkins. The remaining seats were occupied by several familiar men and women - they all missed their faces on television, in newspapers and magazines, and Besib recognized one of the sons of a certain fleet owner. The father and "Tang" Chegaler had a good relationship with Sangdi, and therefore got a lot of benefits. He was a smart person, and he did not forget the hand that the leader of the sea god island thug had extended after taste of the sweetness. It is a versatile hand that can help you and destroy you – the owner of the fleet joins Chegal's “shipping system”. He has a lot of experience on how to carry a smuggled car that has been cut into pieces and exported as waste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone said "all", and now when he is still not shrinking, Hopkins looks at the number five by taking the opportunity to take the wine. The woman who is seated, she is a real star. Each movie has a reward of more than 10 million and a maximum of 60 million. Hopkins estimated that she had been betting for a while, and the makeup on her face was a bit fuzzy, especially the lipstick on her mouth, but she didn't seem to notice it at all. The chips in front of her looked a lot at first glance. But there is no one-and-a-half-point gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gamblers on the 6th and 7th seats may be friends, at least to partners, they exchange their eyes, maybe one can't fight the dealer They will join hands - this is allowed in Baccarat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins explores the body forward and sniffs the smell of the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dealer started to deal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins held the two cards that were sent to him with his nails, his eyes drooping, and he saw a small gap between the gaps of the eyelashes. In the face, he asked for a draw. The opposite of the card that was previously issued is the clear card, which is a four. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dealer calmly opens his own card, a queen, a spade eight, according to the rules of Baccarat, the queen and other cards and ten cards can only be calculated Zero, the bookmaker earned zero points, Hopkins opened his own card, one two, one three, one four, exactly nine, although not "natural big card" (no need to make up the card will appear nine points ), but has also won the bookmaker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty golden glitters pushed over, Ivan’s eyes followed like their shadows: “Your luck is better than Imagine." He said: "The five points are the most troublesome." If you don't make up the cards, it's too small. If you make up the cards, it's easy to exceed nine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
