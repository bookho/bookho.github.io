			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White Salt City frequently puts in energetic new players, just like constantly pouring into a bucket of water, every batch of defensive and offensive players are brand new of. The Grand team has only forty players this time, and can only do offensive and defensive swaps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And they are targeting Besib."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A short two-minute break, the game entered the second quarter, when the Grande team once again got the offensive, Besib was besieged, although four points The pressure of Wei and other players has been greatly reduced because of this, but as a versatile person, both Big Hopkins and Little Hopkins can clearly see one of Bai Yancheng’s defenders in the cover and cover of his companions. I don’t need professional knowledge to slap the elbow, but most people know that the solar plexus is spread around the navel. A, breastplate, shoulder pad, elbow pad, hip pad, knee pad, stock pad, hand guard, ankle guard... but there is nothing but a layer of jersey in the abdomen and back. If they deal with the average person, I am afraid that The unlucky ones have long fallen to the ground and even fainted and comatose. Moreover, according to the latest rules of the Football League Health Committee, players who have suffered such serious injuries cannot play again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the football game, the substitution is unrestricted, the White Salt City team takes advantage of this - there is almost no one in their team. Skilled or experienced players, so no matter which one is changed, they are turning their disadvantages into advantages - the human body and spiritual outbreaks can not last long, and a football game is long Eighty minutes, of which only five minutes of rest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This doesn't seem fair."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It was not fair." Sasha said "This is a bit of a tie." The power and agility of the powers is much higher than that of ordinary people. No matter what competition they participate in, they can easily break any record. They are alive and alive. A cheater that can't catch the handle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But I don't really like fairness." Little Hopkins whispered. This is the first battle of Besib. Bissand, and the first step in his long journey. Even if it is not his reason, this failure will become a stain that is difficult to erase in his white history. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's not hard." Boa. Douglas said: "I will ask them to drink tea during the next timeout." He glanced at Hopkins indifferently. "This is my team." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;etc. Boa. Douglas walked away, Big Hopkins said: "When did it start? I mean, this creepy and considerate." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From playing Catherine reveals our relationship." Little Hopkins said: "And make sure that at least in a short time, he can't replace me. - You see, he is smart."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Hopkins happily reveals his sharp little white teeth, "a passionate Pursuit? Hm?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Catherine is not Marcia." Even though she is full of various changes. But she would not be a pedophile, the cold and fine rain silk slanted on the face of Sasha, and a small part infiltrated his lips. "Of course, this has little to do with us, but I think if she has her own child, maybe she won't run behind my ass now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is hard to say." Big Hopkins stood up and put a hood for his son in a raincoat. The boy's blond hair was wet by the rain and stuck on his cheeks and neck. Above, he patiently pinched them in his hands and filtered out the water inside. Put them in the hat again: "You are the light in her darkness, the people in the desert, the air in the universe. The meaning of existence." Catherine's health report he had the means to get it, but did not show it to Sasha. This is one of the few secrets that he has never shared with Sasha, because perhaps this day, this report will become a very suitable gift or weapon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stop again. The Grande team replaced a player who was knocked down in the offense and he couldn't stand. The situation is not very good, Big Hopkins should perform his duties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beibb waved to Sasha, Sasha raised his hand carelessly, looking around, he saw a slender and beautiful figure Ghostly running to the player's dedicated channel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha immediately stood up, he did not chase it down, it was too slow, he ran up from the audience channel, the two audience channels are like two of the hot dogs The bread is sandwiched like a sausage-like thin and long player-only channel with railings on both sides, and Sasha’s choice of jumps is about twenty feet from the ground, which is a bit dangerous for ordinary people. He turned over the railing and jumped down, just in front of Lila. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where are you going?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lila stood in the shadow cast by the passage wall, her eyes were gloomy, and her dark green tight-fitting cheerleading uniform was embellished with flash The film, the words "Grand". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go to the bathroom," she said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cheerleaders can use the player's bathroom." Sasha said: "What makes you so far from the crowded and dirty audience? Big interest?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lilla’s small, pale face reveals a smile that almost smells sour: “They don’t... ..." She paused a bit, as if she had said something that she shouldn't say and bite her tongue: "Does your authority be so large that you can control the physiological needs of others? Savior?" /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't care about this, Lila, from the inside out, nothing in your body can arouse my interest," Sasha said, his voice almost blended in In the rain, when necessary, he can also speak like his father, not Hopkins, but "Ghoul": "I care about the end of the first half, the cheering team at the halftime. When I was on the stage, if I remember correctly, you are in the middle of the arrow formation and the pyramid formation. So, for this, you let a team member break his leg and let another team member become infected with serious dysentery. The two reserve players suddenly have a fierce quarrel and then they may not be able to take off with you. No, no need Explain, I am not interested in this. I am not a superman, Iron Man or a judge. I only need you to turn back and the game is going on. The cheerleader and the teacher must be looking for you."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go back, now, immediately, immediately."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lila took a step back and suddenly found that she did not understand this standing in front of her Boys, "institutions" don't, no, maybe they just didn't make it clear, Sasha Hopkins's information clearly reads - he is the son of "Ghoul" Anthony Hopkins. She saw it but didn't put it in her heart, because his appearance and the "things" that he showed were so mild and harmless. She once thought that he was old-fashioned, weak and deceivable, but only his father who needed taboos. And his friends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha walked over to Lila, his body was not tall compared to the rugby player, but it was enough to cover most of the light, rain and cold winds surrounded him The black waterproof jacket has a deep hood with a slightly reflective hat covering the forehead's hair and eyebrows. The devil-like beautiful and weird purple eyes sparkle with hard-to-find silver. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he was about to pass by, Sasha did something that most people couldn't think of - he leaned over his body and kissed Lila's lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His skin felt stinging, and in the next second, a huge force caught his arm and he was thrown out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lila’s arms are raised and her fingers are bright red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha bowed his head and his robes were torn open - more accurately, the piece of cloth was gone, even with a three-finger wide chest Flesh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Improve vigilance." Besib said that he stood at the mouth of the passage and his arms rolled up his brother as easily as the elephant's nose. Raise him and bring him to his side. He observed Sasha's wound and snorted. The slippery arm left a small piece when it was removed from Sasha's body, about the size of a little finger. The piece of meat climbed up along the body of the sand, widened and flattened near the wound, covered, and the blood flow stopped immediately, and even the pain was eliminated. "You have to go to the hospital."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No need." Sasha said: "Going to the hospital is troublesome." First he has to explain that he was injured there, what was injured, and this injury may Healed before the doctor finishes cleaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you insist." Besib turned his head: "Don’t worry," he raised a finger and the tip of his finger stretched out, looking It’s the flesh-colored branches, “Lila, or can you tell me what my unforgivable things did my brother do? Did you do it? I don’t think it’s because you just got into his room in the middle of the night, Sitting on his back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lila took a step back, no matter what, the other "branch" of Besib was less than three Inches, they are dense like a banyan tree. She has the ability, but she can only deal with two or three. The rest can easily dig her eyes and break her hands and feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think," Sasha said: "It’s just a kiss."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** *<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This day God has done a lot for Heyman. Strong, so at dusk, the devil came to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
