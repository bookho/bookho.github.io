			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Celegal. Bissance woke up, he quickly recovered to human form, and the toxins and flames did not seem to have any bad influence on him. It’s just that the hair has been smashed a big piece. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Several?" he asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no brain, but Dr. Hopkins immediately understood what he meant, "five." Anthony Hopkins said: "Very Fortunately, only one is the Poseidon Island, and the others are outsiders.” That is to say, there is no one on Poseidon Island: “The other two are in their own room,” the top layer belongs to Besib and Sasha. Two children, two subordinates are responsible for them, so they live on the same floor, when Chegal is out of control, his flesh is all gone, perhaps because there is more food in the downstairs? This is not known. Old Andriana turned on the phone in their room for the first time - they obeyed her orders, did not step out of the room, the third floor was the private territory of Chegal, the second floor lived with old Andriana and Huo Pukins, and the middle-aged woman who is only a hearing person, the guards of Chegale on the first floor, most of them are Poseidon Island, and some are different from each other in recent years. The ability, their abilities are weird, but they are very useful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ordinary people have no way to escape on their own," Hopkins said: "But they live with the powers." The person is able to solidify the body, and when Chegal's flesh attempts to sneak through the keyhole and the door seam, he solidifies them; another abilities can fly, he carries two people in the same suite Suspended outside the room, where you can't touch it; there are other things, etc... The problem is that not everyone, including the abilities, can escape, and one person drinks too much. When the meat wraps him like a blanket and secretes digestive juice, he even wants to do something late; a singer who becomes a big octopus is panicked in the half-light The gun was killed; there was our ballet dancer who had a good tongue to go to heaven, but the meat didn't care a few holes. He could only escape himself and failed to bring other people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The children have guessed it is me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You mean sea god island "Anthony Hopkins nodded safely. "Yes, they guessed, there was a child watching his friend being swallowed, so it was a bit emotionally unstable." Old Andreana wants to kill Die him. Was stopped by the doctor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They can push everything up to the attack of the hostile family, but they can't do much more - Meyare Bissand has been dead for more than a decade, but people can remember if he left it. - Chegaler. Bisangdi is a cannibal devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter," said Chegal, tiredly saying, "I can believe you, is it. My old friend?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course." The doctor stood up and said, "It only takes a few minutes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Hopkins went out Old Andreana came in and she took the other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other is completely different. He is still short, his back is a bit of a habit, and his skin is much more white than before. The biggest change is him. s face. The cosmetic doctor raised his nose and forehead, opened his eyes and thinned his lips and cheekbones. He is now picking up like an ordinary Westernland boy. After two years of training, this Nepalese boy has been admitted to be a small and hard gimmick - he officially "worked" less than half a year, wiped a lot of stains on Chekal Bissand and Trouble, who will be wary of an unarmed boy? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His fists can kill a strong man directly in a minute, acting like a wild ape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Old Andriana brought him for his other purpose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look at Don," she said, "Tell me. What did you see?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Chelal cast a helpless look at her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boy stood there and confronted his fist. Look at the west and look at it. It seems very unwilling to do this. After honing for a while, he muttered aloud, his voice was low and vague. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Old Andriana twisted her two eyebrows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't understand," and to put it bluntly, he barely speaks the Western Continent before being taken up by Chegal, and he also studied in two years. Not much, after all, he is not using his tongue but his fist. "He is very bright, but there are a lot of black spots." The black point of the line, this man, has been split into an innumerable A small piece, he has never seen such a person before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Andriana sent the boy out. She didn't have much boy, and she was a quiet child. She knew the truth. He knew what to say and what should not be said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other pair of fists again, he knew that he had just seen something terrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Andriana closed the door and turned to face Chegaler Bissandi: "Let Besib come back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." Chegaler Bissan said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brian DuPont flipped through the documents in his hand, this is Sasha. Hopkins handed in the homework. Brian had seen three such things before, one of which was done by himself, and the other two were also made by freshmen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins’s score of 4.5 or more, perhaps because his father is a psychopathologist, the report also comes with restaurants, supermarkets The psychoanalytic report of the owner and principal of the food vending point. For a simple example, when he introduced a fish and fries stall, he specifically indicated that the owner of the stall was impetuous and stubborn. The mixed ball, although his fries and fried fish are fluffy and delicious, if you say loudly before you order the staple food, you definitely don't want hot sauce. He will first pour the first special hot sauce on his golden little things. Instead of normal ketchup, those special hot sauces are salty and smelly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone is determined not to pour the special hot sauce of fried fish and chips, the result is a quarrel or even a group, although the fight only happened once, the police There were no records, but Hopkins found the students complaining on the forum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in the same restaurant, there will be some waiters who are noisy children/gay/colored people, while others Quite the contrary, but if you don't want to encounter something that is depressing, it's best not to bring your brother and sister (if they are really naughty), your gay and dark-skinned friends go there to eat - if You must go, then you have to endure the narrowest position, the most dim light, the slowest meal delivery, the least service, or the waiter who often disappears without a trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Those restaurants will protest against us smearing their tendency to racial discrimination," Brian said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
