			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dolores grabbed the water pipe. She climbed out of the pool and gasped for a long time at the pool. Her face was covered with algae and snot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pool creaked behind her, and after a long time, Dolores remembered Annie, she turned her head and was again covered by algae on the pool surface. Then one or two places are bubbly, she doesn't know if Anne has already climbed out... Maybe, maybe not, she stares at the pool of an ampoule, remembering the sweet smile - Anne deliberately put Dolores Sla’s water, a despicable mischief, and everything that happened in the water... Anne’s strength is great, and every time before, Dolores can hardly make any resistance – but Dolores can I am sure she finally succeeded in breaking free... She raised her arm, the blood on her bare skin was everywhere, no, maybe not just broke free, she bent her fingers and saw more than one nail turned back... She remembered the anger How did she catch Anne's hair and press her into the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little girl hugged herself, tightly, as if she didn’t do this, she would shake the whole body’s bones out – she found the nest under the olive tree The ryegrass, which grew so lush, hid themselves in, holding their knees in their hands, their knees against the chin, and she gently swayed her body and sobbed in a low voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joseph Kent returned home at four in the morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He signed the dnr (abandonment of the rescue consent) half an hour ago. He and Mary's baby have been on the verge of death several times before he arrived at the hospital. The doctor told him that the existing medical conditions can keep the baby alive, but in any case, he will not heal, nor will he be awake. The only way to free him from suffering is death - Joseph Kent did not accept the doctor's advice, negotiated with Mary and decided again. He signed his name directly on the consent form - when the doctor and nurse removed the green When he had the piping and equipment on his small purple body, he felt that his body became stiff and cold together. If possible, he wanted to fall to the ground and burst into tears... It was a boy, just starting. Before returning home, he went to the baby store to buy a pair of blue socks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary’s spirit became extremely unstable because of this accident, and she even suspected that their adopted daughter, Anne Kent, had hurt their children, incoherent, hysterical One time, if it wasn’t for the doctor’s decision to add a tranquilizer to the drip for her physical considerations, Joseph Kent couldn’t leave the ward at all—although Mrs. Boro’s care, Joseph Kent couldn’t rest assured, two The children didn’t come by chance, just happened to meet Mary Kent’s innocent moment. When she saw the children, she even tried to jump out of bed with a needle... In the midst of the chaos, Joseph couldn’t care for two children, just let Boro The lady took them home for the time being... He remembered Anne Kent’s unspeakable face before turning away, and Dolores’s eyes full of doubts and fright... he shouldn’t let The children came to the hospital. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He repeatedly thought about it along the way, chewing and chewing each word between his tongue and his teeth. He wanted to talk to two children simply, but talked well, comforted them, comforted them, he didn't want, especially Anne. I will be alienated from Mary because of this incident... Anyway, Mary likes this child so much... and Dolores, his bunny, puppy and little goat, she must be sad and disappointed. She doesn't like Anne very much, but she always hopes to see the little brother - there will be, a little brother, healthy, lively... right, Joseph Kent, he muttered, for I was angry, but I didn’t find myself in tears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joseph poured the car into the garage and walked into the house. He saw the light flashing in the living room, and some people were talking and walked over to discover that Mrs. Boro was down. On the sofa, I slept, the TV watched, and I was playing an emotional program. The people above were arguing, but there was no one who was asleep. Joseph Kent felt very sorry, he wanted Wake up Mrs. Boluo and, after thinking about it, still lived and took a blanket from her storage room under the stairs to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tiptoed and climbed up the stairs quietly, first opened Anne’s room, the room was empty, the sheets were flat and clean, and Joseph was nervous, then thought Maybe the two children will sleep together, he immediately ran to the room of Dolores, this room is also empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kent’s male owners suddenly became nervous, and they will be there? He opened all the rooms one by one, no, no children, he rushed downstairs, hurriedly rushed through the living room, in the dining room and the kitchen, no, no, he shook Mrs. Boro, she didn't want to wake up. The signs, the man squatting in the house like a cockroach with no head, he suddenly thought of something, he ran into the kitchen, opened the refrigerator and the closet, after nothing (he was relieved), he again I ran back to the second floor, opened the closet, checked the bathtub, and under the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t find anything, Joseph Kent’s gaze went outside, and when he saw the pool he slammed a fierce spirit – there’s a few poolside The bright trace of the road, that is the water trace reflecting the moonlight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joseph shouted the names of the two girls and jumped off the back of the house. The grass was wet. He couldn’t see where the water went. Still a small whimper exposed Dolores' hiding place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man rushed over, he tightened his arms and hung the little girl in his arms, "Thank God," he shouted: "Thank God." !"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sincerely fortunately, he could not hear anything except his own voice for a time. Except for the small body in his arms, he couldn’t feel anything. When he was slightly awake, he wanted to pull each other’s distance a little, his daughter’s The little arm trembled and she was crying, clutching her father's neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's okay, dear," Joseph said softly. "It's okay, you are safe. What happened? Let me see." You, Dolores," he reached over the little girl's shoulder, pushed her away, rubbed her wet fingers with her fingers, and stuck her hair on her face and forehead, and found the child's face very distressed. Big piece, hard state, hot: "Damn," the little girl's eyes are dark, and the cheeks are as swollen as he is. He doesn't know whether he was beaten or crying. "What happened? No... I I have to send you to the hospital first, and bear with it." He picked up the child and took the phone out of his pocket. His finger stopped on the "9". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dirty little hand stopped him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't," he heard his daughter pleading: "Don't call the police, beg you," she said intermittently. "I killed Annie." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slamming, Joseph Kent emerged from the water, he On the shoulders, she was licking the soft Anne Kent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He put her on the grass and eagerly checked her body - not that Anne still hopes to save, if the body is in good condition, just drowning If this matter may end in an accident, he will soon be disappointed. Anne is very scarred. There are several small pits on her cheeks and neck. Even Mr. Kent, this kind of criminal investigation. Ordinary people without concept can also see that the size is in line with a child's finger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1949, the Supreme Court issued a decree stating that the death penalty for a 16-year-old minor was not inconsistent with the Constitution; Among the states, twenty-six states stipulate that prisoners under the age of 18 can be sentenced to death, and New York City is one of them. Joseph remembers that the youngest prisoner was only twelve years old. He didn't want his eleven-year-old Dolores to fight for the Guinness record for the smallest prisoner, even if it was possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if not dead, Dolores’s life has been ruined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was shocked that everything in front of him was clear and clear, and he looked up and found that the sky had changed from cement gray to pale purple. Mr. Kent looked at the watch, the pointer was pointing at 5:15, and soon the morning runner appeared on the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dolores, my bunny," he said calmly but quickly: "From now on, you go back to your bedroom and put Wash yourself, eat some chocolate, and have a good night's sleep. If Mrs. Boro wakes up, don't come out, don't say anything. I will come back soon, look at the clock, at most an hour, okay?" Reaching out and touching the little girl's messy face: "Don't worry, there won't be, there won't be... other things, I will solve it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Trust Dad," he said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;t-type bridge has bent into a not known to many people On the trail, Mr. Kent stopped at the end of the trail, got off the car, opened the trunk and made a big parcel from inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was born and raised in New York City until he went to college and left after work. He is familiar with this area and has long since classified this area as a state coast. Before the park, he and the nearby boys built countless bases in salt flats, tidal creeks, peat swamps, sand dams and mangroves. He knew that it was full of danger, and every year before the tall walls stood up, every year. Several children are missing here, and they can't live without seeing the dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took the parcel and walked through the arborous community such as Casuarina, Pinus elliottii, and Acacia crassipes, and then walked forward to see Yellow-green-colored gray-green speckled vegetation, which is a mixed population of paulownia, Kandelia and Avicennia, which is a strangely shaped plant. Its stalks are inserted before the leaves are grown. The roots of the gray sand beach are white bones. The boy of adolescence uses its bark glue for contraception. Its air roots are very developed, so it can survive in places with little soil. It is easy to move along the direction of its air roots. Find the swamp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joseph knows that he should be very tired, but as long as he thinks of Dolores, he can be mentally motivated and endless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No one can hurt you," he muttered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He found a deep hidden swamp, under a dumping stout tree, this thick pod of Acacia is at least three years to be thoroughly Rotting, even if someone is going to find something strange, they will only walk around the tree and will not easily fall into the swamp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
