			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beisib feels very comfortable when he wakes up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rugby Secondary Intercollegiate Leagues are usually scheduled for November, from the first Saturday to the fourth Saturday, once a week, or twice. . Bai Yancheng is the first enemy of Grande this season. They won, but the win is both difficult and dangerous. Nearly half of the players suffered injuries that could not be healed in two or three days, and the rest were also playing. On the second day after the end, I felt unwell and dizzy (obviously, the sweet hypnotic fragrance of John Elder was not without side effects and sequelae) - they had to give up the next two games in a row, I wanted to The Grande executives who shouted "im back" this season had to disappointly replace the slogan with "illback." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishb and their teammates have scored enough of the remaining five games and scored enough points. If it is not the gap caused by the absence of the game twice, their points can already enter the top 25, in the middle school league, the top 25 can enter the big league, which is the national race. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the last game, every member, coach, and member of the school committee ran over and embraced Besib, who was nicknamed For "Little Bison", "Small Artillery" and some strange nicknames like this, the pretty girl put her phone number into his pants, and he also got a big bonus for a sangdi. Said that the money may not be anything, but enough three boys have been happy to spend a while in the town of Grande. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, three, Bep live with them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The birds are noisy outside the window, the sun is thrown directly into the bed from the window without the curtains, and the dark blue blanket is sun-baked like a foot Lying on a cat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beibib sat up and wiped his face in the palm of his hand. He turned his neck and lifted his arms and legs. Massage the knees and wiggle the body - harassing him day and night during the first three weeks, as the pain and exhaustion of the cheekbones suddenly disappeared, like the various colors that once remained on his skin. Big and small scars - both seem to have never existed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boy rolled his lips happily, he jumped out of bed, but couldn’t find it. When he picked up his trousers, Besib found a group of ants inside. Creeping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end he could only imitate the ancient Greeks or the ancient Romans, wrapped in sheets and walked out of the room. He thought that there should be no one in the dormitory at this time. The accident was that the door of the bathroom was locked, and there was a slight sound of water flowing inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is using the bathroom?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh," said Beep, "you wake up Besib, you slept all day and night.” The face was tender and I couldn’t see the new student who had already made a father’s book on his knees: “Hopkins is inside.”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s rare that he will sleep so late." Besib said that he noticed a cookie on the low table in front of Beck’s knee and a raisin-coated cookie. Bottle of milk, "Is there anything else?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are cold-roasted lamb, chocolate pie and fresh juice." Beep threw the book on the couch. "You look much better." He walked past Besib, bent down and pulled out a large fresh-keeping box from the bottom of the bookcase to hold half an adult man. "Musk is Dr. Hopkins from the town." I bought it, the pie was made by Sasha, and the juice was squeezed by me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My stomach has never been so empty," Besibla Pull the sheets. Let it fall off your shoulders so that your upper body is completely freed from the bondage of the fabric: "Dear Beppe," he added thoughtfully: "If you throw a coin down, maybe We can still hear some echoes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crisper has a very good effect, and almost everything keeps their original appearance. The mutton and chocolate pie are rich in flavor, and the juice is very light. There are also small sesame seeds floating in it. "What is this fruit?" Besib asked: "The taste is very strange."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Papaya." Beppe said "The people here use it to make salads."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the sugar is very high," the door of the bathroom opened, and the sand that came out from the inside Then say. "It's all good for absorbing glucose."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib stared at him for a moment: "Oh oh."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just doing a little modification." Sasha said, take off his coat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you think?" Besib looked at Beppe, Beep turned his head, biting his biscuit in his mouth, and staring at Sasha for a few minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Feeling," he said hesitantly, finally shrugged his shoulders: "Not so... 'sharp'." He said When the word "sharp" is used, the language of Poseidon Island is used. On Poseidon Island, "sharp" also has the meaning of a knife. It can be used as a noun or as an adjective. It is usually used in those islands. The body of the men who work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the first day of the Thanksgiving holiday, he began to try to adjust his appearance. Big Hopkins used to be an expert in this area - when there is no condition to make fine adjustments on his face, he will fill the mouth with cotton to make his cheeks full, inject silicone to change the shape of the nose, cut Open or suture the corners of the eyes to unobtrusively change the size of the eyes or remove the wisdom teeth to correct the contours of the cheeks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha does not need to do this for the time being, he has given himself a hair, and the light golden soft hair inherited from his mother can always be lowered to the shoulder. When reading and helping in the kitchen, he would find a rubber band to tie them into a cute little tail. Now they are cut short enough to not exceed the ears, especially the back neck, where almost a layer of fineness is left. The hairpin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many people, this is just a minor change, just cut short, no staining, no hot stamping. But for Hopkins, it is not necessarily - Besib even feels a little regret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also slightly trimmed his eyebrows, making their tails less sharp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishb raised his finger and clicked on his lips. "What is this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The big Hopkins lips are always impressive, because they always maintain a deep red rose that is similar to the pathology. The color of the sand is brighter and healthier, but it is better than others. Who is much deeper, at least Besib has never seen who's natural lip color can present such a rich color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now they are apricot, almost close to the color of the skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The practice and materials of lipstick are very simple. I tried to make one myself, and the hiding power is very strong and the time is long.” Sasha said: Also added a squalane, you can use it as a lip balm."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib made a small face: "I think I can give you five minutes to make up. Brother, after every lunch." He stretched and twisted his body on the sofa, like a snake after hibernation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I used some pyridine... some fixing agents to keep them for a long time. Of course, some of them are not good for health," Sasha Say: "But that's only for ordinary people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For us..." Besib took a bite of chocolate pie, no matter How to say it, being a versatile person is a blessing for many people. No matter where the abilities appear at that age, the abilities will become stronger and more agile than before, grow fast, and aging is slow, not afraid of the cold and the heat. It's almost never sick, and it can be healed quickly by the damage - as time goes by, in addition to the enhancement of the ability, the things that the outside world can hurt them will become less and less. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the physical characteristics of the Sangdi are even more surprising than those of the abilities, and now the Chegaler than the sangdi can even ignore the big Part of the poison and the agent. Because he can use his own tongue, throat, or whatever part of it to wrap it out at the first time. The special course that was previously taught by Hopkins is also for this. Besib always has to figure it out. What is the thing that I swallowed into my mouth to know what to do next. However, for the time being, the drugs they use are only in the category of anesthesia, psychedelic or toxic, because Besib has never been able to learn to "handle" them, each time by the abilities of the abilities. Metabolize or close with the corresponding relief agent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe thanks to the rose of John Elder, after the disgusting rainy night, Besib’s abilities that have been stagnant for several years have finally A small but crucial step forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but we have to say. A good news, a bad news. Besib's body seems to be too sensitive. About 60% of the tablets, medicines, and injections have become the object of rejection. It is not good. Because if during this time Besib is hurt by his own healing ability, he can only wait for death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not have a bloody brother sitting next to him, trying to press his arm muscles, the muscles immediately trembled happily, Besib With. It quickly calmed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
