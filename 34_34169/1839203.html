			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lincoln woke up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is certainly not the one born on February 12, 1890, who led the Western Civil War, promulgated, and maintained the final unification of the Western Continent Finally, the president who was assassinated by the mob in the Ford Theatre in the capital, he took the name only because his great-grandfather used the name, and his great-grandfather took the name to commemorate and thank the person for giving them freedom and life. Great man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lincoln is just an ordinary black man, like the 30 million blacks who live in neighborhoods of more than twenty in the Western Continent provinces. The night swayed in the streets of the sewage, there was no higher education, and I could not catch a chance to make a fortune or seek a satisfactory job. He relied on selling marijuana and earning a living, and occasionally giving it to Dangdang. Beater - He has a good flesh and fist from the street boxing competition, and he will not be too soft if he has the chance to steal and rob. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he didn’t kill anyone, really, although he often boasted in the bar and the bed that he had killed more than once and became an idiot who didn’t know how to be good. Every day, I don’t forget to put a folding spring knife in my trouser pocket. But he really didn’t kill anyone. He would put a knife on the face of the uncooperative robbery as a warning and punishment, but he would never poke. They have chest, stomach or cuts on their thighs, because he knows that these places are full of vitals, who knows where the disobedient knife will go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn’t kill, it’s a miracle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened his eyes, a dusty dust fell, his eyes immediately hurt, he blinked desperately, raised his hand and tried to lick it. I found myself being tortured, not a normal handcuff. It’s the kind of “i” type, the handcuffs and ankles are connected by an iron chain. Four hundred and fifty years ago, Lincoln’s ancestors were dragged into the black slave vendors in Jamaica with such shackles. This kind of jealous person can't stand upright, can't run, and can't resist. Lincoln leaned over his body and curled up. His fingers reached his eyes and his eyes were hot. The dust was washed out by tears, and he could barely see things - first a yellow-colored rubber duckling, black little round eyeballs. The red mouth is followed by a plastic ashtray with a bone china, a broken cigar, a book with a leather cover, and a perfume that is dumped. There is also a thick dark carpet, the light here is too dark, for a moment, he can't tell what color it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not a prison, and Lincoln was so surprised that he remembered being sentenced to life imprisonment. He is not allowed to be released on parole for 30 years. He is already forty-two years old. He thinks he will die in prison. For one piece or a few things that he didn't do at all - those kind of dog-like! Prosecutors and judges of those dog days! He just saw the window of a room open, and wanted to get a little cheaper... When he smelled the blood, he wanted to escape, but he was caught in the crowd - everyone They are so happy, they caught the murderer and they are on the scene! They took photos to identify him. Search his apartment and find a lot of evidence. The detective and the director personally interrogated him. He was hungry and cold. His eyes were lighted up. He couldn’t remember what he said. The police sent him to the court. The prosecutor made the accusation. It was ridiculous. How could they, they accused him of killing six people, all professional women with good character, the murderer hanged them, and then dug out their uterus - Lincoln saw it in the newspaper, the reporters gave the murderer no less than five Ten bloody and amazing nicknames, such as "New Century Ripper John" "Uterus Lovers" "Red Devil" or something... Is he stunned, incoherent, pleading guilty? No, he does not plead guilty, he insists on appeal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prosecutor and his lawyer persuaded him for a long time, the two hybrids were full of sweet words, begging him to plead guilty, as long as he pleaded guilty, guaranteed no Death penalty, life imprisonment is no big deal, they will find him a good prison, complete living facilities, two people a prison, picturesque, football games and cream pies - as long as the performance is good, no time It will become thirty years, thirty years will soon become fifteen years, fifteen years will become five years, then he can apply for parole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was fooled, and it was too late to wake up. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he should now be in the supermax prison (following the hustle and bustle of the group! That is one of the most rigorous and harsh prisons in the Western Continent and even the entire world) Accept a disgusting physical examination, take a picture, and save the number in order to spend the rest of his life in a small iron cage. But where is this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Someone was giggling, and Lincoln turned hard. He got a new vision, and the things inside were more attractive than the rubber ducklings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He first saw a pair of skinny feet, coral nail polish on his toenails, thin ankles that seemed to break at any time, straight calves, plump The thighs, snow white, open without any scruples, in the place near the right thigh root, there is a bloody, vivid big eyes, can only be said that the three ropes loosely lie on the protruding pelvis The abdomen is a little bit sloppy, light gray glass silk pajamas, of course, must be a glass silk pajamas, hanging in the back of the curved arm - Lincoln's eyes reveal a confused look, he saw a bundled in high Young woman on the back chair. He tried to open his mouth, only to find that the tongue was replaced by a clod, and he could only make a sound from his throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman found that he was awake, she lowered her head, and the fluffy golden curls fell to the front of her shoulders one by one. Their owners giggled with enthusiasm. She looked very hot, sweating, and spit out her tongue. The drip of water dripped on the carpet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light was suddenly turned on, and Lincoln immediately closed his eyes, tightened his body, and tightened his muscles to cope with the possible beatings at any time - this is The conditioning condition developed in the interrogation room of the bureau, he waited for a while, no movement, he opened his eyes again, a little bit, even then, his tears still looked like a broken faucet Going out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The things he saw were vague, just like a swimming pool, it took a while for his vision to return to its previous state. And because of the light, the things he saw were more vivid and clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The laughter that made people go crazy stopped, and Lincoln noticed to lick her pupils, and the black pupils could almost reach out - Typical reaction. Lincoln didn't know how many times he had seen it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How about music?" she said, and then it was like the voice switch, the phonograph in the corner of the room was spinning - Lincoln The ear was beaten for several days, and it creaked from time to time. He tried to listen. He was familiar with the melody. A man was singing: "...a rose from the gray area kissed me. A rose kissed me..." He remembered a rose. The theme song, he doesn't like the movie, but he likes it very much. Because it contains the love situation as a drug, the woman makes him addicted, isn't it, addicted... He also had a girl, he gave her. Free, she washes the sheets for him, washes them clean, they do / love on that sheet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t know how she was doing now, he listened and almost entered God. Until the woman screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman screamed, shouting for help, slap the ground with her feet. Her voice was about to overwhelm the music, and Lincoln climbed out of the memory. He staggered and stood up, arched his back and spread his hands. Retracting into the darkness, trying to show that you are not harmful. But the woman is still screaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ingestion too much can cause fear and sorrow, and Lincoln certainly knows that he is staring nervously at the door that is being hit, he should Say something, yes, he can't say anything. He doesn't understand how he appeared here. He wants to escape or find a place to hide. He tied his handcuffs and chained him. He can only be rotated in a circle within two squares. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A man rushed in, wearing a weird, black pointed ear hat and cloak, tights, boots - he was like a hundred pounds of Batman, with a gun in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lincoln raised his hands, and as he thought about how to explain, a bullet penetrated his thigh, then the second one, it interrupted His arm. He screamed and fell to the ground, rolling, wanting to hold the bloody place with his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope I didn't come too late," "Batman" said with a sigh of relief: "My dear rose," he untied the rope for the woman, that It was a slipknot, and when it was pulled, the woman jumped up and grabbed his neck, passionately kissing the mouth under the black mask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know you will come to save me." She replied with a more delicate voice, "My hero." She rubbed each other with her thighs. Between the legs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't know how much I worry," the man held his chest in a dramatic manner: "A dangerous devil! He has killed six and You are as beautiful and moving girl, strangled them, dug out their uterus (the woman just exclaimed and made a fainting look), I was looking for him - his footprints were covered with blood His smell is full of stench, he sneaked in the darkness, ran fast... Hey, I almost caught him four times, we wrestled on the top of the fifty-three-story building, I chased each other on the highway, vying for control of the helicopter, he installed the bomb, I dismantled the bomb... Dear, if it weren't for me, the president's daughter might not escape the bad luck... God bless, justice will eventually win, today I finally Can stop the new sin!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A long time, he said it was a bit difficult, but fortunately his female partner was very eye-catching, she Always give her lips and tongue in time to make him good Rest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," said the man. "I will have something to do after a while." He pushed her away and walked to Lincoln. Two or three steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I..." Lincoln moved his tongue, and it was a little perceptible: "I am...I am not...criminal."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man stunned, and his eyes hidden behind the mask groaned at a terrible speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
