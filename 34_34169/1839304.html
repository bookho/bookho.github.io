			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishb can feel his body suddenly floating for a moment, then pulled gently and violently, and he fell on the blanket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a wonderful thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw the white dome, the orange-yellow light shining through the outside, the curtain was warm, his shoulders and the back of his head were elastic goose down pillows Underneath the body is a furry blanket. The sheets covered on the body are dry and clean. He can smell the smell of milk with maple syrup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are we here?" Besib asked cautiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s here." Sasha said he looked more relaxed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is your world?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just a small space," this miniature world The founder sat up and his eyes were biased toward cobalt blue in the faint light: "Winning is absolutely safe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even your father "No, he?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He doesn't do either," Sasha explained. "I said before that he was able to enter my memory palace because That was what I built under his guidance. I also invited him, so he not only mastered the structure but also the key; but this small house was built by me elsewhere, he didn’t even Knowing that there is such a place, how can he find the door to open in? Not to mention that I am constructing this space just for the conversation, I will not leave anything here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Where do you say somewhere else?" Besib tried to move his body, after he did not encounter any obstacles and imaginary ground shaking A more comfortable posture: "So we are on someone else's site?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If it is someone else's site, when you are ejected, I It is impossible to find you, just because it is mine, I can control everything here." Little Hopkins immediately denied: "My father has warned me countless times that I can never easily enter other people's thoughts. Human The sea of ​​memory is extremely vast and changeable. Compared with it, the Palace of Memory is not even a drop in the ocean. Not to mention the subconscious. It is more terrible than the sea of ​​memory, because a human being can have a sense of consciousness and feeling. Everything that comes to it is inside. It is bottomless, boundless, and with a little touch, the information contained in it will ruthlessly rush your brain in a moment. God testified that this damage is not Reversal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha remembers his father. Anthony Hopkins once took him into a person's thoughts and overlooked his memory of the sea. It was just an ordinary young man. His memory of the sea has not yet been too There are many hidden treasures, but his subconscious mind is like countless dark black ocean currents – they are as strong as the most loyal little hounds watching the owner's precious possessions. Hopkins walked silently with his son in the minds of this young man, and then tore a small hole in a rather vivid dream at a time he thought appropriate. Sasha will never forget the situation at the time, and the world that was originally grotesque but quiet and silent has collapsed into countless pieces. They fall down uncontrollably, and the subconscious mind lurking in the deepest part of the sea of ​​memory is like a giant snake that is entrenched under the tree of the world. It is quietly picked up, and the invaders are opened with a poisonous gas and venom. Huge mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thought suddenly hit him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha Hopkins is not not considered - empty classroom? No one's confession room? The cave where the bats live? Late night at the seaside? There may be countless places where he can talk to Besib alone - it is unwise to expose his ability too much, but there is always a voice telling him that this is correct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is it correct? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of Besib. The brother who had no blood of his own was silent first, then seemed to fall into a short period of thinking, and finally he saw fear in the confused purple-blue eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took Sasha’s hand, the hand was cold as if he had just held the ice, and Besib took a deep breath, he might No Hopkins is smart, but the Poseidon people are always very sensitive to life and death. He almost guessed what Sasha thought of in the next second. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beibb just wanted to say something, the curtain suddenly violently shaken, he was not prepared to be taken out without any precautions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This little accident made their conversations have to be postponed to the second day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha is troubled, Bessie doesn’t think how bad the problems they found the night before, obviously, want to enter a person’s mind and It is not easy to let a person enter his or her own thoughts. Even if a second person has the same ability as Sasha, Besib is not a little girl who will follow the stranger to the lollipop. At the very least, he can summon the prehistoric mammoth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Hopkins has given him a lot of information and experience, he is not ignorant of this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishb entered the Sasha territory for the second time in the scent of milk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His friend sat on the bed with his legs crossed, and a pair of dark circles made him look like an unhappy raccoon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is going on?" Besib pointed to his own eyes. According to their current physique, even if they do not sleep for ten nights, this problem will not occur. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Subconscious." Sasha replied that Besib's attitude directly affected him, and he looked less tense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Take it temporarily and let it go." Besib said, "We have more important things to do, how much time do we have? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At most four months," Sasha said: "They want to try it out before Easter."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When it really starts making money, there will be other people to take over the business here," Besib said: "The real management will not be handed over to us."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is, if we really want to end this sale," Sasha said: "We can only find opportunities in this half year - in addition, I want to cut Le Bissand will not be pleased with this," he reminded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then don't let him know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Celegal. Sib’s father, Besib, loved him and feared him like other Poseidon people. He did not want to let him down, nor did he want to violate his wishes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Children on Poseidon Island are all made, boys have boys' models, girls have girls' models, sons like fathers, brothers like brothers, nephews Like an uncle, no one can walk. On Poseidon Island, the cruelty of enemies and prey will be praised, and pity for those who are indifferent will be regarded as rebellious or cowardly - Besib surnamed Sangdi, he is Chegal Heir, the future "Tang". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only the devil knows how many eyes will look at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
