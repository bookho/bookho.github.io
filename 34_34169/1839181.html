			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two children walked in the shallow water, the tide rushed ashore, washed away the smell and washed away the footprints. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are going to give me a surprise, right?" asked Besib, turning his head to look at the gloomy sea, when the gunshot suddenly sounded. He jumped involuntarily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Absolutely." Sasha replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha is doing a test question now, his father, Anthony Hopkins left it for him - questions in an hour or earlier A little reveal, open book, no time, but you must be solid and review and consolidate in advance, before you even know that this question exists - Sasha believes that he can get at least 4 points (5 points), the only Unable to grasp the guy around him, Sasha’s footsteps paused a bit, and Besib was not originally in his plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like that the life of Chegal is saved by Big Hopkins, and the small Hope is taken from Bethb’s mortal world. Kings - Anyway, Besib gave him a lot of help. Without his guarantee and recommendation, Sasha would have a hard time doing this. It would be a bit difficult - just a bit Child, so he only extended his hand when necessary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one of the reasons, the second reason, this non-required additional question may bring a lot of extra points to Sasha Hopkins ...he said, not only from his father, Big Hopkins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What did they encounter?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha looked past Besib’s gaze The lights of the ships float on the sea, but there is no tendency to approach them. To be exact, they seem to have not moved at all. What else can I have? A group of whale sharks at the right time, the smallest weight is also more than ten tons. The main food of whale sharks are plankton, giant algae, krill and small self-propelled animals (such as small squid and vertebrate). In the past two months, they have been cruising in the nearby reef area, preying on the eggs of giant Brazilian snappers. - They are not interested in humans, or humans. But they are willing to help Sasha a little busy, for example, using them to deploy a small lifeboat-sized tail fin to flip one or two boats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this does not mean that they are safe now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha didn't let Besib wait too long. Before the children's physical exhaustion, the latest and last destination appeared in the eyes of Besib. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You said it would be a surprise." Besib said that his face was not very good. "But I only got scared. You really know this." "Where is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The shelter." Sasha calmly replied: "It is said that even the place where the god of death can't find."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name of the cave is ironic, because only the deceased can be sheltered here - sometimes the members of "Masoy" will also be compassionate, When conditions permit, members of hostile families can get a chance to make a dying prayer or a cemetery; private detectives, officials, and mercenaries do not have such good luck, because children often play in the vicinity of the sea, The people of Poseidon Island rarely sink people into the sea like the close relatives of the Western Confederation. The superstitious old people firmly believe that this will lead to seawater pollution. In order to maintain fresh air and clear sky, cremation is impossible. The public opinion is buried in the cemetery on the island of Poseidon It is in short supply - they have to worry about for a long time, until a young and reckless explorers found a "sanctuary" cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not very correct to say that the cave filled with free tail bats was known to the locals hundreds of years ago, but no one wants Go in. The bowl-shaped cave is crowded with at least a million bats, which are hung upside down on the rock at the top of the cave. The heat generated keeps the entire cave at more than forty degrees, and the bat's droppings accumulate on the ground. It is a few feet thick, and there are countless carnivorous beetles, cockroaches, cockroaches, and giant worms in the faeces. The disturbed bats will madly attack the invaders. Their teeth and claws are small, but the number is created. The quality is still very impressive, and like the warm-blooded animals like dogs and cats, its saliva contains extremely dangerous bacteria, microorganisms and viruses – this is not the most disturbing thing, and the fear of people is the bats and reptiles. A large amount of ammonia gas formed by the combination of metabolites and water vapor, and a slightly higher concentration of ammonia gas can be fatal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tail hair is bleached with ammonia to a slightly reddish-brown free tail bat to neutralize ammonia by reducing the metabolic rate to increase carbon dioxide in blood and respiratory mucus. Gas, thus living in this dark cave without any peace. For the unsuspecting human beings, as long as you walk in here for a few minutes, the central nervous system will be excited by the high concentration of ammonia, which will cause convulsions, convulsions, lethargy and coma, if the stupid guy insists on staying in the original If the ground continues or deeper, a higher concentration of ammonia will directly cause his reflexed cardiac arrest and respiratory arrest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The explorer entered the cave at night with a small compressed oxygen cylinder for diving. He was surprised to find that the cave was not as plain as people thought. After walking through the bat's territory, it was flat. The depression, the center of the depression sags downwards to form a funnel-shaped hoistway, the hoistway is deep, but the rope that is thrown away tells people that there is water below, the water surface is about two hundred feet from the ground, and the water depth is more than one hundred feet. - There are only a few variegated transparent fish and shrimp in the water. The water is just ordinary sea water. People are disappointed, but very quickly, its real use has been excavated - those bodies that have nowhere to go are thrown into The deep hole in the cave. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; The cave was like a bloody mouth attached to the esophagus, greed, generosity, perhaps because the relationship between ammonia and high temperatures, the body It will soon rot to the fishing can not get up. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; even the most daring children rarely willing to approach this place, so Beelzebub will not find in the first time they came to exactly where. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "I do not think we can get shelter here." Beelzebub said. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "You know, Neptune Island is not really too much." Sasha gentle persuasion: "If you are worried about the cave there is not much available breathing gas, do not worry, it's just the average person. "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;" we are not ordinary people "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;? & nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What made you still insist on me and you are an ordinary person after so many unreasonable things?" Sasha smiled and shrugged: "Yes, you are not, I am not, our father is not "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; *** <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; bats fly out to have been a very long time But the cave is not quiet, the carnivorous beetle in the feces knows about the ropes, and the top of the cave is flying with thousands of gray, fluffy young bats, they are practicing flying, every few minutes, there is no dodge The little guy was hit by his companion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What should we do? Go over?" After the initial stage of sore throat, as Sasha said, Besib is unimaginable. The speed adapted to the stench and dirty air in the cave. He gasped and felt bad, but still alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He bent down and observed the deeper the faeces in the middle. A small bat fell into the pile of faeces, and the reptile swarmed up and ate it into a white bone in a few minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib moved a toe, and he noticed that Sasha was wearing a rare calfskin boot on the island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s just stinky," Sasha walked a few steps inside, and the worms rolling in the faeces rushed to the sides like insecticides. Retreat: "Come on, don't be like a little girl," he said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expression of Besib at this time is really worth seeing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more you go, the colder the air, the more fresh the air, with a salty taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is wind." Besib raised his fingers and felt it. The wind of different sizes blew from several directions: "There is a branch." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They turned into one of the branches in the middle. This branch is very narrow. In the last few steps, even two children must crawl on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The end of the branch is a wonderful space, it is round, as smooth as a gas hole in a cheese, with water on the bottom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the rest of the cave, there is no outside light, but Besib is sure that he has seen a translucent thread with a little bit of fluorescence. They hang down from the top of the small cave, the long ones can almost touch the nose of Besib, the short ones are only small, the children's actions touch the air, and they tremble extremely slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha grabbed Besib’s shoulder and licked his lips in his ear: “Don’t talk loudly.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is that?" Besib tried to keep the sound to a minimum, but it seemed to be alarming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fireflies," Sasha said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Unimaginable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
