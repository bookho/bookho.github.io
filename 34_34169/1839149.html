			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Camilla was taken out, her father, Mr. Kason, was also taken out of the cellar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His body became stiff due to the cold and embarrassment of the mantle, especially on his legs. His heel fell on the ground and he vomited him. People found this, but they were sympathetic. They kept pounding his back and ordered him to walk forward, not to stop. They walked along the brown lanes outside the house to the restaurant. The restaurant is a temporary rest and dining for visitors to the farm. It is very spacious, very comfortable and has no heavy smell. An open kitchen is next to it, and the kitchen stove is stewed. Pot hot soup, one of the thugs with a mask is busy at the oven, taking out a large piece of bread from the inside, the scent that makes the stomach of Kaisheng country burst into a lap – how many hours have he not eaten something? His watch was taken away, and the faint glimpse of the glimpse could not even tell him whether it was morning or noon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thugs in the warm room are scattered or sitting or standing, but it can be seen that they are central and the only one sitting at the table The people are their leaders, and everyone will unconsciously look at him. When Kaisheng is pushed into the door, he is concentrating on a delicate piece of glass. This is a small gift for the guests. The crystal clear plexiglass is solidified with a squid seedling that has been hatched for a long time. It is transparent and curved like a crystal leaf. The black eyes are surrounded by a pure golden ochre, and the neck is a bit bright. The red color, which means it comes from Lake Damarista in Maine, and only the fry in that place will have this feature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Beautiful little things." The leader said that he was wearing a mask and the voice was a bit fuzzy. "Squid is a strange and tenacious creature," He turned around in his hand. "Every year, in September, the hottest two days, the hurricane is coming, the river is rising, the flood is raging, and the mature squid swims down the darkness of the moon, swimming to the sea, their * * The official can develop completely in the sea, then mating, spawning, and dying; after a few months, hiding in the seaweed, the eggs that are not eaten by the fish and shrimp hatch the transparent fry - they will drift with the current. Until the estuary to the coast, they will develop into a white transparent linear “glass enamel” and then go upstream – they will face a series of dangers along the way: rocks, mud, hydroelectric dams, river diversions, pollution, diseases Encounter (multiple stings, beluga whales, especially cockroaches) prey, and more and more people are fishing - but they will still struggle to swim up the river, and soon, the body will darken and become black.鳗", after reaching the freshwater growing area After growth and development, the body color changes to brown, also known as "brown scorpion". The whole process needs to cross nearly a quarter of the earth - some lucky ones can find a suitable lake to come down and wait for five to eight In the year, they produce a hormone that causes them to embark on the path of their ancestors, and by that time their bodies will turn silvery white."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course," he said. "What I said just now, everything has nothing to do with this little guy," he raised a hand, pointing out his thumb and pointing out: "And those It doesn't matter, humans try their best to catch the seedlings, keep them in the pool, and feed them carefully, so that they are full of food.” He shook his head: “They will never get a chance to swim into the sea and breed offspring.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plexiglass small ornaments were put back on the table, cautiously, as if the fry would be scared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyes turned to Kaishengguo, Kaishengguo suffocated and looked at the young man - he had a pair of clean, cold blue eyes, turmeric The hair slipped out from under the hood and hung on the forehead of the day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello, Mr. Kay," the young leader said: "We are ealf."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;ealf, the Earth Animal Liberation Front, a loose organization of radical activists, is a widely used name for animal liberation activists who are directly acting in the name of animals worldwide. . They took animals away from laboratories and fur farms, man-made destruction and animal testing, and other animal-based industries. According to their statement, any action that promotes the cause of animal liberation and takes all reasonable precautions to avoid harming any animal (human or other animal) can be crowned ealf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems pretty good at first glance, but the behavior of this organization has become more and more radical in the past two decades, and some extremists with special interests - the most notorious Prominently, the “thugs” in the animal rights and environmentalist movements use the means of destroying other people’s property and terrorist activities to declare their claims that they have been unable to use “prank” for ten consecutive years. The arson and poisoning cases and bombings described have caused tens of millions of yuan in economic losses. Nearly 10,000 people have lost their jobs, and dozens of others have died or been injured. This is no insurance, compensation and imprisonment can be The problem is solved, their behavior directly threatens humanity (whatever it is), and more and more institutions (including Greenpeace and the International Animal Protection Association) and the country are beginning to quickly alienate and ignore this increasingly crazy protected animal. group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the mid-twentieth century, UN Resolution 1562 included ealf on the list of terrorist organizations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have lost most of their support and connivance, but this has not created an obstacle. ealf continues to be blind but firm, and their means are constantly changing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kai Shengguo opened his mouth and wanted to talk, then found that his throat was dry and could not make a sound, the leader nodded, and a mob came. A cup of warm water was handed over to Kaisheng, and Kaishengguo took a sip and was surprised to find that there was a little sugar and salt in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you." He said, the heart involuntarily derived a glimmer of hope, they are not pirates, he slowly drank water, thinking, these people need What do we do? Release those squid? This is not impossible. But they can do it themselves, what else do they want, money? It should be, they need money, any organization needs money, but he must try to make it clear to others that this is a ransom, because these people are in the hands of people, not his voluntary donation - a support for terrorist organizations Member of Parliament? Even if there are only unfounded speculations and conjectures, his political career will get the head. No one will believe his words, support his resolutions, vote for him, and may even be monitored and questioned by the FBI or other departments (interrogation). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kai Shengguo is not good at negotiation, but he also knows that he can’t rush to speak out, especially with regard to money, members of ealf may feel Offensive or contemptuous, they may become violent, chaotic, impulsive, and there are his daughters and innocent children here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lowered his head slightly, holding the glass in both hands, trying to make a gentle and peaceful posture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of Kaisheng’s surprise, the sharp blue eyes did not stay on him for too long, and the line of sight quickly moved away, accompanied by A silent command, a mob opened the door and a man came in with the escort of two thugs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kai Shengguo stood in the middle of the room, the man saw him, his footsteps unconsciously paused, and the mob behind him immediately reached out and pushed him hard. Completely disregarding his whiteness and wrinkles. He wandered a few steps, and his two feet were together. If there was no Kaisheng country, he would fall to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The glass fell to the ground, and debris and water splashes were everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Old Xu?" Kaishengguo whispered in surprise, "How come you come here?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man stood by the arm of Kaishengguo and stood up. He observed it seriously, and then his face showed a comforting look: "I was entrusted to see you with your own eyes... sure that you are safe and sound." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kai Shengguo and the old Mr. Xu are old friends for nearly 30 to 40 years. They will visit each other every Christmas and Spring Festival. There are two large restaurants in the 7th district. I also have a low position among the Chinese. Together with their age, they have never been treated so rudely and contemptuously. The anger has been from the soles of Kaisheng. Burning to the neck, almost burned his reason together, but in the end he still controlled himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can I get you?!" Kaisheng’s anger is unstoppable: "Is the Kay family dead?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't know... I am afraid that this is only the case." Lao Xu smiled: "They only allow one person to come... but there are some things, I am afraid that only one Kai family can still be the master. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kai Shengguo picked up his eyebrows. His eyebrows are thick and long. When they are mixed together, his face will look very fierce." "What do you say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe we want too much," the leader said suddenly, his tone light: "They have to be cautious ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How much do you want?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We don't want money," the leader shook his head "We want the top ten restaurants and restaurants in the 7th district to cooperate with our actions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What action."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader is standing Come, his eyes bent over the mask: "Collect all the shark fins, bird's nest, net abalone, wild animals, snakes, birds, dogs, cats, turtles and cockroaches... We have integrated a list." He is happy Said: "According to our requirements, these goods and animals are installed separately and shipped to our designated location."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Xu touched Kaisheng The arm of the country took out the list from the pocket. Kaisheng Guo took a quick look at him. His face was quickly filled with incredible and incredible. This list is complete like a list of restaurants. The first ones are almost all three-foot-high "Tianjiu" with no market price. Each family is used in town shops. Several of them are passed down from generation to generation, and they are older than Kaishengguo and Laoxu. No wonder it takes a lot of time to come – it’s not really a thing that Kay can do. “How are you going to do?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader closed his mouth and didn't seem to think about answering the question. After a few minutes, he gently waved his hand: "The specimen and the dead will be destroyed, and the living will be released."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, each family’s loss is at least a few million or even tens of millions. This is still on the bright side. Nowadays, shark fishing has been banned by many countries, especially the The giant scorpion shark, now known as the Tianjiu wing, is mostly harvested from the shark's shark's fin. The real Tianjiu wing is probably only those in the glass cabinet. Compared with the ingredients, they are more Close to an honor, or a symbol. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kaishengguo is extremely angry and laughs: "I am afraid that my Kaisheng country is not worth much!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Lao Xu forced to hold the Kaisheng country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader did not violently react or violently react as they imagined. He stretched his arms and both hands swung back and forth like a fish. "There are a lot of people here," he said quietly. "There are ten children, two women, and four workers. If they don't do what we say, or what they do, we will publicly kill all the hostages." - Just like you treat sharks, cut down their hands and feet and throw them into the sea. What do you think? Mr. Kai Shengguo? If this happens, who do you think will be approaching the seventh district? Eat at the restaurant? Who else will treat a Chinese person well? Their table is full of blood!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His words are like a bowl of mixed ice Cold water, only suddenly, anger is gone, and luck is gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The madman." Lao Xu said that his voice trembled and unconsciously used his native language. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can't money?" Kaisheng made the final effort. "No matter how much, we can try to raise funds. Or, allow each store to leave one or two specimens." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader stared at him for a while. "You are still the same, Mr. Kai Shengguo, face, dead and money are always more important than life." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," he made a gesture, and the two mobs stepped forward and grabbed Kaisheng: "There is nothing to say, Mr. Xu, you. I have seen the living, no less than the Kaisheng country, you can go back, I will give you two hours - don't interrupt, I know, enough, you have a fixed place to store those dead bodies, always available Goods - of course, can be brought to us. You can tell the police what you saw, but remember that anything that happens after that is closely related to your mouth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
