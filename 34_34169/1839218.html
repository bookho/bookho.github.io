The water came: "He received a lot of precious gifts last month."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tea bag?" Chegaler took the tea bag over and over again He couldn't see why, it was a very delicate tea bag, diamond-shaped, tetrahedral structure, translucent, with dark green leaves and deep purple petals inside, he put it under the nose: "Aroma hits people "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The space is so large that it is easy to make the fragrance come out," Hopkins said: "Lavender flowers and mint, added a little Forget me. Thank you, Andreana," he took the water, only a small pot, but if you just want to make two cups of tea, it is more than enough: "Taste, cutler."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dried flowers and leaves will soon be dyed into a beautiful purple, the degree of richness of the scent will increase, cut Le out two fingers, pinch his ear so that only large cup: "I have not smelled so strong smell of lavender tea," he said, holding out his lips sip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Drink it, Chegar," Hopkins said: "This is not just lavender tea, not just mint and forget-me-not. "There are other things in it." Chegal said: "I will taste it." He opened his mouth, his tongue spread open, and he took off a piece of vermillion rug, and the hot tea was poured over. Above, the water droplets swim, roll, and the tongue surrounds them, limiting their direction, ensuring that each taste bud can feel them carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two men said nothing, the time slipped away like sand, and Old Andriana walked in with her feet and took away the empty space. Teapot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Know that time," Chegal. Bisandhi broke the silence: "It is on the Tower of Babel, your son, Sasha. When Hopkins’s ability works on me. Does my feeling?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Not bad?”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it not bad?" Chegal immediately commented: "It’s just amazing. It’s faster than eating fuller, more comfortable than soaking in a bath, even killing it yourself. The enemy's ease and comfort are not as good as it is, more accurately - more than sex / high / tide." He breathed a sigh of relief: "I didn't have any thoughts until I wake up?" His eyes are hidden. Behind the stack of skin, a gap like a matchstick, it stared at Hopkins without hesitation: "I want to kill Sasha Hopkins."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The father of Sasha Hopkins put down the teacup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The feeling that makes me feel scared," continued Chegaler. "I know how to identify drugs, but I have never been among them." Anyone who is addicted to it is even more impossible after awakening. They have lost their effect on me. The same is true for cigarettes, alcohol, and women. The pleasure they bring to me becomes minimal, and it equals nothing. It also makes me feel. I only have to eat. I have to swallow the food that will make 20 lean guys explode in the stomach every day. The mouth keeps moving, let my fat pile up into mountains, why? Because this is my only entertainment, but The things it can bring to me are getting less and less. I am constantly adding, dear Hopkins, you are very clear, but one day, it will disappear without disappearing - sometimes I will Become confused, there is only one spot left in your mind. Guess what?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My son."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, your son, his ability." Chegaler said "Tang" on Poseidon Island has a lot of rights. But there are a few things he can't do. One of them is that it can't be controlled or influenced by things or people. He must stay awake and rational at any time... I," Chegarer gave a thumbs up. Pointing at himself, "But Hopkins, your son can break this, the Virgin, no, the devil knows how much I want to enjoy the kind of power shock and encirclement...the pleasure...the order I am fascinated," he whispered, as if he was afraid of someone hearing: "I quietly listed a sheet on a piece of paper. If I can get this power, what am I willing to pay? The answer is - all. My rights, My obligations, my body, my mind, my spirit, my son, the loyal and unfaithful to me, the entire Poseidon Island, he is willing to take it and take it!" His eyes showed the color of fear The face has also changed, this is more than a sangdi has been seen for a long time no one has seen: "Hopkins, it is terrible. I am willing to give everything, I long for strength is like those poor worms craving drugs, although I understand More power is actually not very useful to me. I am 'Tang', my crisis has passed, the traitor has died, and Poseidon Island is safe and sound with me."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He let go of his hand and let the tea Fall, cups broken into pieces on the stone floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So when I know where you are from there, I want to kill you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "What made you change your mind? Chegal?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am afraid I will regret it." Chegal said clearly: "I am afraid that I will regret after losing Sasha Hopkins. At that time, what is the use of anger? The dead are impossible. Climbing out of the grave - I think, I should see you, this is a gamble. Now it seems that I won - although I still feel unbearable, but I can insist," he said proudly: "I beat myself, I am not controlled by my own desires."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are indeed a respectable person." Hopkins said that he went The darkness shrinks and hides oneself deeper: "Most people can't do this, and some don't want to control it at all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Celegal I smiled. "I just want to tell you, I remember very clearly about the power of your son. My memory is not blurred. Hopkins, this cup of tea brings me the power of your son is very similar, it makes me Clear-headed, energetic, focused, heart full of joy, feeling omnipotent - Even if it's only a few tens of thousands of the latter, it's really rare, I think, the precious thing you said is here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “I did an anonymous test,” Hopkins drank his own tea: “There is no coca, no poppy, no stimulants, no pesticide residues,” he licked his lips: “Clean is like a fresh Baby born."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Life is guilty." Chegal said: "This cute little herb is probably the same - I want to have another cup now." "What about you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Me too." Hopkins and Bissau looked at each other. They were all patience and their willpower was like steel. The people who can shake them are few and far between – they are still like this, what about those students? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Amp has investigated that only the ninth and tenth grade students are transferred to this comprehensive tea bag, and that the eleventh and twelfth graders are not only When people buy this kind of tea bag, each bag of tea can be sold up to one hundred yuan to one thousand yuan."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Addicts."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It can't be considered a pure addict, because they are not inseparable from it. Grande has a summer vacation. Many people mentioned that they only have homework or frustration, and quarrel with friends. And when you are in love, you will especially want a cup of comprehensive tea. This idea can't be said to be weird, everyone loves herbal tea, this is a tradition."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But as long as there are conditions, they will do everything possible to get this tea." Hopkins said: "Dr. Douglas's deepwater club has gathered a lot of outstanding good students, some of whom have graduated, but with Douglas Doctors still have extremely close ties, and there is constant exchange."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The time is still too short," said Chegaler. "Grand is a good school, it Thirty-four percent of the students applied to the best universities in the Western continent, giving him twenty years, and his supporters will be in the political, financial, and educational circles of the entire Western continent."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The people of the Douglas family will be ecstatic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't think so," Cheka Le said: "Boa. Noel Douglas is also drinking this tea." He stared at his fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who knows?" Hopkins said: "I heard that his uncle is very fond of him, and even can say that he is a little afraid of him." Dr. Douglas stood up in the same profession, pushed the chair behind him and walked around the table. He glanced at the pieces of tea on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The large and small pieces jumped up and glued in the air, and it flew back to its original position, where it was placed, exactly the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doctor Hopkins stopped and he blinked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacup is still in the old place, torn apart. (Note 1)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Talk to me? Boa. Douglas, Said Sasha Hopkins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Talk to me," Boa. Douglas said: "Last Once, Miss Marcia."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...as long as you are still in the swimming team," Marcia said: "It won't be the last time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So," Boa’s face was pale as never before, and he looked like a frame of black and white silent film: "As a person who loves you and I love it." People... the last conversation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
