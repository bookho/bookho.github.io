"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If possible, Sasha prefers to sip any kind of drink slowly, wine, iced soda, various spices and tea The milk, of course, also includes coffee, but he is too lazy to disobey the wishes of his friends in this small matter. He drank his own coffee, screwed the little one, and prepared to reverse it. Above the cup and saucer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cup fell from about three or four inches and slanted on the plate, making a loud and sharp collision, and the coffee stick that had not solidified was splashed. All. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an unimaginable mistake. I don’t know if it’s the gods or the devil’s ability to give them not only in places that make people feel incredible, it also gives them Bringing the senses, physical strength, healing ability and agility beyond ordinary people, even if it seems to have been swollen like a half-melted butter-like cutler. It is easy to catch one in existence. Birds or mice within sight. When Hopkins moves, it is more reminiscent of the vampires that are common in movies - a black shadow that wipes the corners of the eyes, a wind that sweeps across the cheeks, a fleet of musk and tobacco flavors. As long as he is willing, the person killed by him will be completely ignorant in the first few seconds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib jumped up, to be exact, he thought he jumped up, but others seemed to say that he could only say that he was a little dull and stretched out his arms. Go forward. But we have to say that this is still necessary, because Sasha is simply standing upright on the small round table - if there is no other arm of Sisib, his nose and lips will suffer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh," Besib complained vaguely: "I never thought you would repeat Chekal." It’s not a good sign, only People who are drunk, anesthetized and die will be so heavy and soft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha did not speak, his strength and remaining thoughts were used in more useful places. For example, Besib. He moved his hand slowly and raised his hand, and the little finger gently touched the bare neck of Beb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warm invisible force poured into Besib's body, stronger and more vivid than any previous one, and the duration is very short, about two or three seconds. Kind, but enough to make Besib sober, a few muscle bundles from the waist above the slippery shirt, slipped out to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The floor was covered with heavy carpets, but this did not prevent the part of Besib from feeling a constant and rhythmic vibration. Someone is coming here, a small tentacles of Besib help his arm to wrap up a friend who is already completely soft, and two other tentacles extending from the latissimus dorsi extend to a window about six feet above the height— - All the windows in this special small hotel are very high. Very small, like the castles and churches of the fifteenth century, can only allow sunlight, air and more than ten pounds of creatures to enter and exit - for example, cats can, but not too fat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seemingly soft and fragile tentacle rips openly the decorative window sill. Breaking the glass, the cold and cold air outside the window poured into the nostrils of Besib. His nose was a little itchy, accompanied by a small sneeze, more muscle strips sticking out of his body, inserting masonry. The gap. Helping him climb a smooth wall, some muscles squirmed, and Little Hopkins was moved behind him. The ten fingers of Besib stretched, hardened, sharpened, and dull. They were like hammers and chisels. First, the finely divided, then the large concrete fell, and Besib explored the body from the widened exit. The salty wind immediately wrapped him, his eyes sparkling in the darkness, and the night streets were quiet and gloomy as a long-abandoned grave, no one, no light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishb with Sasha, jumped to the road more dexterously and lightly than a cat, now it is raining, the rain is not big, the rain is fine, the road The captain is black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost as soon as he landed, he was hit, and the strengthened skin and muscles were able to withstand even less powerful bullets, but this Bullets are special. The boy who grew up on Poseidon Island knows what it is. It is an anesthetic needle designed to deal with large sharks. It has an explosive capacitor needle that emits a current when it comes into contact. The voltage is very high, the current is very low, a needle can make a big guy weighing half a ton lose resilience, and he now has at least a dozen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are of course not enough to control Besib, skin and muscles squirming and squirming quickly, replacing the necrotic part of the current with good. What made him even more headache was the sudden increase in the scent of roses in the air. Just as they smelled in the room, Elder John walked out of the alley, his sleeves were rolled up, and blood was drawn from the cut blood vessels. Under the turbulence, his pale face is like a black and white photo, faltering, but his eyes are as firm as two nails. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey? Sasha?" Besib said that Little Hopkins did not answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adverse effects of the current anesthesia needle and the damn rose scent caused the spirit of Besib to burst, and he could not help but tremble, feeling soft and dizzy, "The Madonna testified." He shouted. When I saw a few flesh-colored tentacles waving happily in the rain – this little tentacles should not appear at this time, he couldn’t even feel them coming out from there, let alone control them. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishb tried to raise his head (God knows what happened to his neck? Broken? Or moved under the navel?), the rain hit his eyeball He tried to command the tentacles that were surging around him - he had practiced with Sasha, used tentacles, and swiftly and agilely ran like octopus, whether it was cement roads, sand or mud, or even walls - But he soon found out that this time, the tentacles are mostly good, but there are always a few too free, they are not only unwilling to follow the master's orders, but also do the opposite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More people appear from both ends of the street, their clothes are almost identical, white shirts, black trousers, some black robes, are men, Without an umbrella or wearing a raincoat, with no expression and silence, the whole scene is like a non-mainstream small production horror film. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not good, Besib remembers the town that Hopkins told him, Doug Town. The town has a population of no more than five hundred, and Baiyancheng is a city, a big city with tens of millions of people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you be worse?" he said to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The facts were quickly answered, yes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha. Hopkins is also out of control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ghoul" released his hand and the doctor slid onto the floor His mouth is very big, but the cut trachea and vocal cords are destined to be impossible for him to send useful information. He is like a chicken slaughtered by a chef, and Hopkins pulls him up. one hand. Wipe the paper cutter off the sleeve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he turned around, a nurse pushed the door and came in, so Hopkins had to smudge the knife again. This time he broke in from below. The blood flow is not as much as it was last time, but Hopkins's camel coat is completely undressable. He takes out his wallet and driver's license from his jacket, takes off his jacket and throws it on the floor, and wipes the knife again. Into the pants pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corridor of the hospital is empty. Very quiet, the lights at the atrium were bright, and the nurses and doctors who should be sitting there were gone, only one wrinkled black priest and a few cute lads on the face. Hopkins estimated the time, from his hands to now, but less than four minutes, they should always look at it. Look at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the place to save people." The black priest said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But the same can kill." Ghoul said. At the same time, the knife in his hand was thrown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weapon that has ended two precious lives flew to the face of the black priest. He did not hide or block, and the knife disappeared when he touched his skin. It is. In such a blink of an eye, Hopkins was gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Top." The black priest said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins stood on the ceiling of the hallway, and it was true that the hair was hanging down as he moved. Leave a fuzzy red footprint on the white ceiling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black priest jumped up and his feet stepped on the wall. Leaving a wet imprint, his body tilted in the air - Hopkins twisted his toes, turned upside down and turned a circle, and the movement was as beautiful as demonstrating a standard posture of a small rotation of Werner Waltz. Two people passed by, and the priest felt that he touched him, but he was not sure. The ghoul fell on the ground, seemingly unharmed, except for a soft gray hair behind the ear, which disappeared in the next second that it was touched by the priest's hand, as if it never existed. Over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest’s injury is more serious than him. His neck is torn away from the shoulder. The wound extends from the neck to the bottom of the collarbone, and the blood is soaking his blood. The robe and, if not he listened to intuition at the beginning of the millennium, this tear will be his carotid artery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins smiled at him, his lips were bloody, his small, white teeth biting a slender flesh and blood, he sucked and ate it. It’s no different from eating a macaroni that has been accidentally pulled out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As with any kin other, this kind of injury that would cause ordinary people to lose their ability to move or even faint is not a problem for the priests - the problem is, The breath and color of the blood flowing from him severely irritated the boys. From the time they were five years old, they began to prepare guns and knives to confront the pagans and demons who may be all over the world and accepted the relevant Hard training, but the vast majority of them only killed sheep and dogs. The injured and dead people, though not seen before, also participated in the pursuit of the fallen and watched them be purified by the flames, but faced the "real devil" "It is still the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
