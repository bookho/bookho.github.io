			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie has a foot on the yawn that can be checked by the dentist at any time, and there is a black under the eyes. Obviously, he didn’t sleep well last night, but He was able to keep up with the team and help a boy who accidentally sprained his neck while sleeping to take part in the baggage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idiot who actually falls out of his sleeping bag and sprains his neck is not a student of Grande, sneaking a bottle of water to Charlie, adding a disinfectant and boiling it. The river is not good to drink, but each of them can only carry three bottles of five hundred milliliters of water in their backpacks, unless they give up a tool that may be necessary - Charlie took the water and said nothing. Into his backpack, then shook his head and motioned to keep up with his team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the boy walked past the Besib team, his expression and footsteps were equally easy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha looks at him and looks at Charlie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing, I am used to it," said Charlie. "They are not bad, just if you show me well, or don't follow those people..." I made a helpless expression and carefully selected a word: "Reject me, they will be treated as homosexuals, and they will be troubled by those bastards who are endless. I am willing to take it all because I am really gay, but if Some people are simply involuntarily rolled in because of their good temper, it is too bad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But you are talking to me now. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because you are not our school." Charlie smiled: "And you are strong, people around you are afraid of you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought that Besib would be a stronger one in the eyes of outsiders."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" His body is indeed the strongest," Charlie said. "But he listens to you. You are the head."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Boa. Douglas?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is just a screaming Chihuahua," said Charlie. "If you really want to do it, even me." I can deal with him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't look down on him." Sasha said with a smile: "The Chihuahua's teeth are also sharp. And he also has a bitch's dad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie I licked my mouth and didn't speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are studying in a public school," Sasha changed the subject: "I thought that such extreme exclusion of homosexuality would only occur in strict rules. In the church school."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If a student at a church school publicly declares that he is a homosexual, then the school will be after a while, I mean, things are no longer so After being eye-catching, contact his parents, talk to him, and try to ask him to leave his school in a peaceful state—although they also believe that homosexuals have the same human dignity and rights, they have to consider others. The feelings of more children and parents - you can't be so selfish, right? On the Internet, a good friend of mine, he is a church school, he told me that during his time in school Seemingly calm, as usual, no insults, no beatings, boys at most will avoid him in the shower and dressing room. If they realize that they have done 'over' in some places, they will apologize They were very polite to him, very polite, and with a little pity - until he offered to drop out because he didn't want to be always used by a kind of 'God. This is a lost little lamb made of cellophane. Can we How to save him? 'The eyes look, it is too unbearable, of course, better than being slutned, smugglers or being beaten with a good nose."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha nodded. Although he was not gay, he was at the beginning. He and Besib are also incompatible with the students of Grande, the aggressors, the predators - they don't like him and Besib, but all the temptations and bullying are very few people quietly The sound and tacit understanding are done. After discovering that they had kicked the iron plate, they were retreating faster than the salty slug. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Public schools can't do this," Charlie continued. "If a student in a public school is asked to drop out of school because he publicly admits that he is a homosexual." The teachers and principals involved will be prosecuted – because of discrimination. They will be told to go bankrupt.” He breathed a sigh of relief: “So they don’t care if you are a homosexual or if you’re being gay. What – the children here are noisy and more lively than yours. Many of them don’t like to study or have to apply for a good university. They may have many brothers and sisters. They didn't have the strengths of their hands, and they didn't have the talents beyond ordinary people. They were obscure and mediocre. No one was willing to look at them more, but if, suddenly, one day, they finally found a goal, for example, one. Damn gay - yes, he is smart, but he is a gay, he is handsome, but he is a gay, he is Dancing, but he is a homosexual, he got the best, but he is a homosexual, as long as he is gay, he is a mischievous mixed ball, the Bible said, he is a sinner, so they chase, fight, laugh Ah, teasing... It’s an epic hero, no one will take care of this kind of gossip, and they can report back to their mother: Oh, dear Mommy, I got a gay today, I should get a piece of chocolate. ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie learned the tone of the child, saying that while he was breathing slightly, he looked at the ground and his eyes were full of hatred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He and Sasha went so quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know which of these two is better," he said later. "Maybe the worst is homosexuality."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Have you considered dropping out?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing is necessary," said Charlie: "I don't want to lie, so It is the same everywhere."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Charlie!" the head shouted in front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He doesn't want me to approach you," said Charlie. "Because he is worried that you are infected with homosexuality." He pulled the shoulder strap of the backpack: " But I know that this is impossible. Our eyes are very accurate. You, and Besib, you have no minimum curiosity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Do you want to make him angry?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Some," Charlie said without saying: "I saw you at first sight and you know that you are the one he likes." Kind of child, he loves my mother very much, my mother is blond, blue eyes, and I can't inherit it at all. He is doing very well in the army. He is a good soldier and a good boy, but I don't like being a person. The conductor doesn't like to direct others. Your body is also beautifulr than me. I am too thin and looks unhealthy. However," he grinned mischievously: "You are very charming and very tolerant, so I am willing to work with you. Close, say a little more, for example, is a sexual function and a normal young man, suddenly met at the door of the supermarket Lilian Monroe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Marilyn. Monroe has been dead for more than half a century."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please forgive me," Charlie apologized happily. "I am not interested in the dreams of today's boys."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Charlie!" Long shouted, the tiny dust and leaves fell from the top of their heads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that I have to go forward." Charlie said: "It will be good to talk to you again."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie's slender and thin legs quickly disappeared into the sight of Sasha. They walked a rocky path of the intestines and dug them along the wall. From the cross-section, it was a mirrored uppercase c with a thick rock on top. Some places are short, but they are guaranteed to pass through a donkey. The twenty-mile-long path is created by the priests of the monastery they are about to visit through centuries of effort, thousands of pilgrims and Merchants have walked this way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many places where they pass through the dark green strong fiber mesh to ensure that no broken stones fall off their heads, gray roots Prominent from the rocks covered with moss, like the blood vessels protruding from the skin of the old man, they will also appear on the ground, like a curved threshold, the Grand River is about eight from them. Ten feet, vertical distance, and a low bang swelled through the children's eardrums. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie was originally at the end of the team, now he has to cross other people, he must go from the opening of the mirror c, this road is wooden, crooked The railing, but its height can only hold a lamb at most, Charlie walks around the left hand side of the boys, he is far from their body, the ankles rubbing the grass and mushrooms sticking out of the railing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib has been staring at him, Charlie soon arrived at the destination - behind the head of the group, Besib did not know what the headmaster thought. But their backs are really like. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a rain at noon. Fortunately, the head of the team was an experienced person. According to his schedule, they just came to a rest point. It was a Natural caves are enough to hold everyone shelter from the rain. They take towels from their backpacks, dry their hair and body. All the food, cheese, chocolate, biscuits, water, and olives are taken out. Everyone can get it. The big ones will be quick, and it will take another two hours to reach the monastery. They only need to leave the last little supply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rain stopped very quickly, and the sun came out in a blink of an eye. After the head and other roads were slightly dry, they only made the order to start, they went back on the road, the air The smell of the earth is filled with the smell of volatile oils and actinomycetes spores released by flowers and trees. Their feet are stepped on small otters, and the tiny insects around these small otters are changed. And the skin around the human* is flying, bringing like itchy, the salsa's ointment has been used up, they used insecticide, but the effect is not good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The end of the stoney path is a dense jungle. Because of the relationship between the locusts in front, the head does not allow them to stay. He orders everyone. Pull the socks up, pull them into the trousers, and then put them under the hat with a towel. The exposed skin is only the face and hands that can be seen by yourself and others at any time. This will shield most insects from harassment, especially It is a locust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
