			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Please allow me to summon Elder Josiah," said the middle-aged monk, who held one of the three keys of the sacred room. Trusted by Hayman, he is the brother of Heyman. He ranks seventh among the 23 sons of Jared, called John. Before he became an elder, he called him the thirteenth John. The monks and nuns of the supervising sect often have duplicate names. In the case of the same surname, they can only make a distinction in this way. John’s biological mother was very popular, but she was excluded from the sight of the saint before Herman was born. Her son was almost expelled. Heyman helped them. At that time, Hayman was only ten years old. , but has been able to use and demonstrate the power that God has given him. He was grateful and surrendered to this youngest brother. In his heart, Hayman’s weight is much heavier than the current saint Jared: “Your wound is still bleeding—if this continues, it may affect you. Body, so how do you continue to serve the saints properly and carefully?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hayman turned and looked at his brother with the rest of his eyes, he Already wiped his face, the blood flowing out of the eye socket that lost the eyeball and the unknown liquid still left a bright and sticky trace on the pale cheek, and the dizziness caused by blood loss almost forced him to fall to the ground. “You don’t need the elders of Josiah to get some powder, alcohol and oil from the marijuana zebra (a powerful hemostatic herb).”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The monk almost didn’t hide his expression. Heyman’s empty eyes were sunken, his eyelids were close to the bones, and the swollen lower eyelids turned out like a flattering lips, looking ugly and Disgusting - a perfect sculpture was Ruthlessly destroyed, the murderer is also a victim. He knows well that Heyman is so ruthlessly ruining his body. Heyman loves and respects their common father, but it is regrettable that today Jared is only in love with another son. The monk still remembers the little brother, who was ordered to be exiled by Jared, because he hid the Bible, how old was he? It seems that he is not on his chest. The person in charge of exile took him away. According to the usual practice, he was placed next to an interstate highway. There are hundreds of miles from the nearest rest stop. Farther away from where his relatives lived together, far away, it is impossible for him to come back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who can think of the thin and useless Harvey will become the mighty Stefan? Since Jared knows that Stefan, who has shown countless miracles in the Vatican and elsewhere, is crazy after he has mercilessly expelled his son. He single-mindedly wanted to let Harvey or Stefan return to the wings of Strang Jacob. The past sins were not investigated, and the conditions he proposed. As long as it does not affect the saint Jared, all can be satisfied, he squats day and night, forcing everyone who appears in front of him to find and recall his lost son, regardless of whether Heyman or others What have you done. What he said can't have any effect on him - he wants to swear, he wants the miracle brought by Harbin, he wants to take back the lost youth and health from time, and grab the life that can disappear at any time from the god of death. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others may not think, but Haiman’s brother thinks. The virtue of the sage Jared is fading away, replaced by the "sin" he has reaffirmed over and over again in radio and video. He has been polluted. Fallen. There should be better people to guide the fascinating Lambs of this filthy world - Heyman. Stronge is the only and only candidate, he is so convinced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he found out that he was thinking about something, he immediately bowed his head, and he couldn’t let people other than himself perceive—at least until he succeeded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He waited for Heyman to step out of the room and his eyes fell on the tray that was randomly placed on the table. The toasted bread inside has been softly collapsed, and the white grease is condensed on the beef. The fresh apple slices show the sallow-like yellow tinge, the chocolate milk is already cold, all the food is warm, and the air is filled with the unique metal smell of blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John thought he could wait quietly, but obviously, the fact does not allow him to delay and hesitate again, Hayman is likely to be in the saint Jerry De was burned thoroughly before being summoned by God (maybe the devil?). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Whenever there is blood, you will die together; the world will still return to the dust."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John Said to the empty room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why don't you celebrate?" Chennike said, he is happy. (although he rarely gets frustrated), today he looks particularly radiant, perhaps because of the relationship between drinking more champagne, his face is more round, smooth and bright than usual, that fat The belly of the pier will swing up and down with the undulations of the tone as he speaks, like a gel ball on the human body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha’s gaze stayed on the interesting belly for a while: “I want to take a break.” Whether it’s the stomach or the ears. He has never been keen on eating and drinking like the age-conscious and adults who are not self-controlling, and does not like meaningless quarrels and laughter, let alone screaming - it is two to three years old. The ordinary children should do things. They are not interested in dozens of people huddled in a small hall with a tempo but a strong tune, and his interest habits are almost all played by Anthony Hopkins. It is both exquisite and extravagant, with a little paranoia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beautiful and rare purple eyes passed through the crowd and landed on Besib. As one of the protagonists of today, the dark-skinned boy was surrounded by a group of teenage boys and girls. He noticed Sasha’s sight and raised it to him. Lifting the cup, the golden liquid in the cup swaying under the light - this is a generous gift from Big Hopkins. He ordered a full bottle of champagne from the southern region. This champagne manufacturing process uses a lot of energy. Time-consuming and costly “traditional method”, that is, the method of secondary fermentation in the bottle, the annual output is about 300 million yuan, and the price is high – he does it purely because of the sand, if conditions permit, He always hopes that his children can get the best. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't worry, there will be several games for the Grand Swim team tomorrow," Professor Senek said with conviction, even though he misunderstood the silence of Sasha. The reason, "I believe that you can stand in the same position as Besib, maybe you can be taller than him." He said happily: "Unfortunately, I am not the team leader of the swimming team. But when I am I will buy tickets to watch the game and cheer you up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha smiled, no, he and Besib are the same, whether it is football Still swimming, they are all tools for their advancement. They value their achievements, but they will never be so excited. Of course, they will not give birth to their hearts because of the success of their peers. At least such success will never happen, but these do not have to Colornek said it was too clear. "I think so too," he said quietly. "Yes." He looked around the crowd: "Have you seen Lila? I haven't seen her since the beginning. Is she a little uncomfortable? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Xeneke blinked his eyes: "It seems like this is true." He quickly glanced around the crowd: "Speaking of people who are absent It’s quite a lot, your father, our Dr. Hopkins?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;”He is still in the hospital.” Grande’s victory came and Not easy, most of the team members have more serious concussions and multiple soft tissue contusions. The two most severely injured members were the clavicle fracture and the slight lateral fracture of the left knee. The operation will take place tomorrow. Both of them need to be observed for another 24 hours. Together with the teachers and teachers, the coaches will return to Grande. It was impossible to say that they were sent to the hospital after the game. As a team doctor, Hopkins went to the inspection report and the surgical plan to explain the copy. He has already called Sasha, and there are too many people. He may be delayed until three or four in the morning. But I hope that Sasha can rest early. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When are we going tomorrow?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the afternoon, there will be a special shuttle bus, just like when we came. Why, is there any problem?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have an ominous Premonition," Sasha said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Professor Cheneke stared at Sasha for a while and suddenly broke his mouth again: "Child. Have you revisited recently?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elder Josiah is not a native of Baiyancheng, his parents are Catholics. He was inspired and re-baptized in adulthood and became a monk of the Superintendent. He was able to become an elder, besides piety and selflessness (he donated all two-thirds of his income to the Supervisory Church), and because he was an expert in cardiothoracic surgery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Baiyancheng, hospitals and doctors were a rare thing before this century, because according to the interpretation of the elders and saints, the Bible has clearly stated that humans The evil often means that he has been eroded by demons. Only the omnipotent Lord can save them. Except for prayer, holy water and holy things, people who suffer from diseases can't get any help, and even be used as a source of plague. People hate to stay away - most of them can only be forced to stay in their rooms waiting for the arrival of death - if they are traumatized, they will only use herbs at least (mint, ginkgo, big green leaf, stinky leaves) And marijuana zebra, etc.), olive oil and alcohol, as well as eye drops are allowed, because these can be found in the Bible - Isaiah 47:12 says:... The fruit of the tree will be food, and the leaves will cure the disease. Revelation chapter 22, verse 2 says: There is a tree of life on the side of the river, and there are twelve kinds of fruit, which bear fruit every month; the leaves on the tree are for healing the people. In the parable of the good Samaritans, the Samaritans used wine and oil to smear the wounded (Luke 10:34). Alcohol can be sterilized, while oil refers to olive oil, which lubricates and protects the skin. As in the middle, Jesus advised the Laodicean church to buy eye drops and wipe their eyes so that they could see them (Rev. 3:18). Because Laojia Jiacheng is famous for its ophthalmologists and eye medicine products. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every saint and elder have set strict rules related to it, but with the gradual development and improvement of modern medicine, the general embarrassment of steel is inevitable Loose, saints and elders can't avoid the pain of aging and aging. They can't immediately establish a medical school, but they can pick ready-made fruits. Elder Josiah is one of the best and the best. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
