			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city of Baiyancheng has a population of about 181,000. The population of the central city is 100,800, of which 60% are Supervisors, not including children who have not been convinced because of their age and those who are not recognized by the sect - Hispanics, Africans, Asians, Indians, and a small number are almost negligible Do not count the "hybrid." "Hybrid" refers not only to pedigree, but some supervisitarians do not follow the "sage" or the "elder" or marry a devout believer as a husband/wife, but a pagan (ie If non-supervised people become their own lover and partner, they will be expelled immediately, and their children will be regarded as "spirits", meaning inferior little devils - they were called this 100 years ago. Only for nearly half a century, this "sage" Jared began to implement the "fruit" policy of external softness, that is to say, at least on the surface, the supervision sect is no longer so inhuman and cold, he Allowing well-behaved believers to open hardware stores, restaurants and clothing stores, allowing schools to establish football teams and swimming teams, allowing outsiders who have been identified and censored to enter and visit Baiyan City in an orderly manner... Some of them are easily irritating to outsiders. The sensitive words were exchanged, including the "geeks" that were replaced by "hybrids", although these two words are not too big for the believers. the difference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the saint Jared is the person standing at the tip of the pyramid, and there is only one person next to him, Hayman Strange, he is this year Only 19 years old, but already one of the elders most trusted by the saints, even if he is three times as many as his uncle, he has to bow to him, and his mother and sisters can only kneel on the ground. , kiss his feet - in the case of permission. More often, they are forbidden to approach him. A person like this, the resources he can possess and use, of course, will not be classified as "less" and "poor". In fact, Hayman. Stronge is second only to the saint Jared. He has an ensuite: a bedroom, a reception room, a study room, a semi-open gym connected to the terrace, and a fully equipped bathroom. In addition to hot and cold water, a special tub can provide synthetic brine similar to seawater. The sister work responsible for all the cleaning and finishing work here is diligent and serious, even in the vents, there is no trace of dust and stains. They can even pick up the water in the toilet to drink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hayman stood in front of the mirror that occupied half of the wall. He knew that the mirror should have been wiped clean, and he stared at it stubbornly. Then in the delusion to create a stain that does not exist, it is this stain that blocks his view, so that he can not see what he wants to see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised one hand and held down his still bleeding eyes, saying, "You will serve the Lord your God. He will bless your food and your water, and you will remove the disease from among you." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He removed his hand, his eyes were still bleeding, and the intense pain pierced the inside of his body like an angel's spear, again and again, under Once is always more severe than the last time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has said this sentence countless times. I have touched others like this many times, he treated them, and they always get cured. But he could not heal himself or he could cure his father on earth—because they were the only people in the world who did not believe in Heyman. Hayman only believes in Jared, and Jared only believes in the previous haw, now Stefan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A traitor! A pagan! A counter! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He held down his chest and used his fingers with blood and tears. He wants to make a roar of anger and sorrow, but he finally slams the roar into the body. He beat his heart, turned to the Father of heaven for help, and prayed for mercy—because his father on earth had abandoned him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lord, please pity me, because I am calling you all day long...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... I have been asking for your grace. May you pity me according to your words!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......Please turn to me, have mercy on me, as if you are always waiting for those who love you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hyman. Stronge is crying, the young and healthy body is curled up tightly, he kneels on the floor, forehead Against the cold floor, slender fingers crawled on the face and stayed on the injured eye: "If this is what you want..." he muttered and said: "Take it." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as you can see me again, love me, recall me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Lord, my Father. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The finger is deeply inserted into the eyelids, he is a bit unskilled, but the movement is very stable, as if all the pain and stimulation have flapped his wings away from the sea Man carefully rubbed the soft, round, hot, wet thing – and dug his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing here?!" The offensive team coach who appeared at the other end of the channel shouted: "The intermission time is up!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a member of the cheerleading team who needs to perform during the intermission, Lila is a must, and her blessing, Grande’s cheerleading team can be said to be a small one. A lot, she stunned and angrily stunned Biebu, and slid back and forth in the footsteps of the wall of the passage (that is, the farthest from the son of the thug leader). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishb also has to hurry back, the next round is the turn of Grande, the coach will seize these few minutes to finalize their formation and combat plan. And Sasha needs to meet with his father in the company of Mr. Chennike, Mr. Anthony Hopkins - Besib has already recovered his own part before the coach appeared, the abilities The powerful healing ability guarantees that his next little lies will not be immediately exposed. The injury in the chest is that he does not know what is being caught and injured when he jumps off the channel. Of course, the boys’ tricks are not enough. Dr. Hopkins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not ask Sasha carefully about this matter, and the game lasted for an hour at a time. After that, he always found the opportunity to figure out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shout like a tsunami came from afar, Sasha slightly raised his jaw, and Big Hopkins reached out and held his face. Let him look at himself, "Don't worry too much about the game," the doctor said. "This victory must belong to Grande." He said as he fixed the gauze on his wound for his son. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is certain." In addition to Boa's special drink, Grande also has Hopkins here, Besib is the only one in Sasha. A friend, also the son of Chekal Bissand, a piece of chess that was first put into the Western continent and given high hopes. Temporarily, Besib did a good job, but there were always some places to mention and help, and Anthony Hopkins took on this role – as a formerly favored and trusted by the upper class. A well-known psychiatrist, he is too familiar with them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But understanding does not mean that you can easily enter that circle, it is a complex disorder that is enough to surpass the Ander River side of the Heiner del Maze (the world's largest In the ghost place of the plant maze, you never understand what they want - extremely often, you have wealth, but you find that they need a reputation, and when you have a reputation, they ask for power. You are not easy to get the power, but also find that they pay more attention to reputation, waiting for you to throw money into a variety of charitable foundations, unfortunately, you still lack history, ok, maybe you can get from your home loft There is a record about my ancestors, but that's too bad. Your grandfather is actually a hotel businessman, and your grandmother is just a farmer, and your great-grandfather was once a thief who was hanged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
