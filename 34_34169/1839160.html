			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One week ago, Gucci Hefner, owner of the Bunny magazine, club, and other surrounding affiliates, lost his private psychiatrist, while the latter was on vacation Drunk, from the balcony on the third floor, he did not hesitate to plant into the swimming pool - no water, attending the funeral made him feel bad, he urgently needed a new psychiatrist, his latest fiancee Lilith Meyer recommended one to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new psychiatrist is pleased to be invited, his name is called Anthony Hopkins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gucci Hefner talked with him briefly for a while, and he looked radiant as he walked out of the room. This new "buddy" apparently voted for Hefner's spleen and stomach. He liked him, trusted him, and even allowed him to live in a big house. In the past, only the most beautiful girl could have this honor. Gucci Hefner is a head temperament. A violent old lion, he will entertain some friends who must not be annoyed with him, but at most one or two nights, more? No, even if you are the head of the loan department of Bahrain Bank or the next presidential candidate, security guards, water repairers, salesmen and milk delivery are remotely outside the mansion; no matter which girl, younger, then Beautiful, and promising, as long as she was found to be in private with the guy, she would be finished. Hefner would not give her the time to pack her bags, and she would immediately get out of it, just like this - he always focused on driving those who dare The males who violated his territory and the females who were not obedient and meek. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Hopkins is not on the guest list, he is one of the owners of this mansion, at least for the time being. But Bonnie was the first to see him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry," Bonnie said, she changed her standing position and shifted her weight to the other foot. This position will increase the burden on the knee, but Can better show her body curve: "I disturb you?" she said in a sweet tone of false pretense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Hopkins shook his head, and he came out of the shadows, and Bonnie looked at the gradually expanding shadow in confusion, and she immediately discovered that The shadow does not belong to one person, but also a child. He (she) was originally sitting on a small platform in the corner of the terrace - a small platform with a replica of the 3rd and 3rd BC - the first three or three years ?? 髌 髌 乖? 鞯 蚵逅 蚵逅 蚵逅 罄硎 裣瘢 裣瘢 暧 暧 暧 暧 暧 暧 暧 暧 暧 暧 暧 暧 暧 暧 暧 暧玖 牛 牛 牛 牛 牛 牛 牛 牛 牛 牛 牛 牛 嘧 嘧 嘧 嘧 嘧 嘧 嘧 嘧 嘧 嘧 嘧 嘧 嘧 嘧 嘧 嘧 嘧 嘧 嘧 嘧 嘧 嘧 嘧 嘧 嘧 嘧 嘧 嘧Crisp 谏竦淖钪匾????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? ??

However, if someone carries one or two playmates that are more suitable for their own taste and can guarantee that there is no problem, he may turn a blind eye to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins watched the bunny in front of him with interest and observed it with the children in his arms, neither speaking nor showing an unpleasant look . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie finds himself in a dilemma, he will be angry later, he will complain directly to the rabbit mother or Hefner, she will be deducted bonuses and The salary of the month was driven out of the mansion. If she was given another chance, she would say nothing and do nothing. This is the real way to survive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think this is not something you need to care about, Bonnie." A voice suddenly sounded behind Bonnie, and Bonnie was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A beautiful woman walked into the terrace, and the velvety squats behind her, like a luxurious background, setting off an incomparable gemstone crown - The blond hair of the beauty, that is the real blond hair. Unlike the hair dyed by Bonnie and several other bunny girls, they are golden when they are drilled out of the hair follicle, and they shine with glamorous luster under the moonlight and the light. They are high-profile, wrapped in a delicate face, a swan-like elegant neck, milky shoulders and arms bare/naked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is Anthony's child, the son of a child, I don't think he needs a bunny girl to tell him what to do," she said unceremoniously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie’s face suddenly became blood red, and then became pale, she knew that she had misunderstood, but fortunately she did not say too much, too understand, but The previous ones were enough. She prayed to God that Hopkins did not figure out another meaning implied in her reminder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her reaction seemed to please Anthony Hopkins, the psychiatrist revealed his white teeth in the moonlight, "Oh, it doesn't matter," he said generously. "I don't think she is malicious." He turned to Bonnie. "Thank you for your reminder, but this is no way. I haven’t been here for a long time, so I can’t find someone who can look after Sasha for a while. Well, as you can see, I have to carry it with me. I can’t let it. He stayed alone in the empty room." He made a brief but clear explanation, then added: "And we will soon go back, thank the host's hospitality, but the next activity is early for Sasha. A little, or ten years later?” He rubbed his nose with a nose and rubbed his nose: “What do you think?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The child is amazing It reveals the kind of extremely helpless but gentle and indulgent look that Bonnie originally thought would only be seen in adults. He reached out and touched his father's face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..." The beauty said: "Hefner is still waiting for you outside, he hopes to introduce you to his friends." She said with a little urgency: "His friends, you know, they are full of curiosity about you, Hefner is adored by you - he has never done this before, I mean, with so much Words to praise a same sex," she giggled, her voice crisp as if it were the rightmost sound on the piano keyboard: "The time is not too long, after all, they will have other important things next. "I want to do it," she said. "In this time, I can look after this cute little angel for you," she squinted at the child in the man's arm: "Sasha, you Called Sasha Hopkins, right?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins stepped back, “Thank you,” he said. “But it’s not.” He gently but simply refused her diligence: "Lilith Meyer, I think Mr. Hefner is not willing to leave you for too long." He put Sand is put on the ground: "Miss Bonnie, are you called Bonnie? Please come over, I think I have to give you Sasha temporarily." He bent down and put his hands on the shoulders of Sasha. "One Hours, I think enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, I am very willing." This means she will lose a lot of tips, but now Bonnie only I hope that Mr. Hopkins, who is deeply loved by Mr. Hefner, can forget the stupid things she just said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Hopkins dropped his head, and Sasha Hopkins whispered a few words and took Lilith Meyer out. Curtain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
