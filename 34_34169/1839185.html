			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fishermen of Poseidon Island rowed boats, carrying two or three strong, water-friendly young boys, Father Peter sitting between them, only wearing A Meyer was surrounded by them in the bow. He was not tied up. The thick hands were placed on his knees, his hair squatting, and he was tightly attached to his forehead and cheeks. His face is very bad, the yellow is blue and white, full of small sputum, the lips are like a model made of rubber, the nose is red, and the two loose eye bags are like a 90-year-old woman. It hangs swaying under the skin folds of the lower eyelids. In short, the heirs of the once-spirited and lively "Tang", now all over the body, can be reminiscent of his past identity and status, and only those dark eyes, the eyes are dripping in the eyes Rotating, as always, with the indifference and coldness of the lizard creatures, the unsatisfactory and vicious smell can be heard even a distance away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a bottle of sealed Châtel-Lead bubble mineral water, the brand that Maya’s favorite, a self-evident suggestion, plum Yalei hesitated for a moment, then came over and unscrewed the lid to drink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And someone gave him bread, and Meyare also ate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea is very quiet, only the sound of the squeaking of the paddle into the sea, and the sound of Meyare’s stuttering and drinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the last piece of bread was swallowed, people could clearly see the slender and sinister Christ, although the shallow mist in the morning was still tightly shrouded. It is a black tern that falls on the horizontal line symbolizing love, carefully tidying up its feathers, and the person responsible for paddling is pushing the paddles hard, trying to scare it away, but the little bird Just looking up, indifferently watching the human beings coming closer - its eyes are red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fishermen immediately bowed their heads and crossed the cross on the chest. In the legend of the sea god island, only the seabirds who had floated on the surface of the sea were There will be red eyes, like ghouls wandering in the cemetery, they are the servants and ears of the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s too embarrassing." A man whispered, this is an ominous sign, he squinted and sat in the boat The head of Meyare, a daring murderer, a detainee, a traitor, but at this time he also had to admire the courage of this guy, if it is him, maybe he has already scared his pants now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tern waited until the people approached the distance that they could reach it with almost one hand and then patted the wings lazily and flew away. The two boys kissed the cross and the Bible carried by Father Peter and rolled over. They first pulled down the rope fixed on the bow of the bow and wrapped it on the frame of Christ so that the boat would not be in the process. The tide of the sea was far away, and Mei Yalei, who had done some warm-up exercises, jumped off the boat with the support of the other two. The sea in the morning was a bit cold. He took a nap, but he quickly became familiar with it. I got water and let myself float on the water. The two young men who had previously entered the water grabbed the end of his shoulder and took him to the front of the Christ. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seawater only goes under the crossbar of Christ's frame, Father Peter throws steel chains and locks from the ship, and the horizontal and vertical piles of Christ's frame There are holes in the parts, and you can tie a person firmly on this terrible torture stand by passing the chain through them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fr. Peter supervised them to do all the work, and when the boys got on the boat, he also drove the water - the vestments of the long and the feet were like in the sea. The horsetail seaweed is so cumbersome, and he has only one foot, and the other hand has to hold the Bible and the cross high, which makes it very inconvenient for him to move in the water, but fortunately there is a rope that is consistent with the pier and the ship. It can be used, Father Peter slowly approached Meyer along the rope until the two literally "face to face". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you regret it?" Father Peter asked, panting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meyal looked at him, "Yes," he replied with a sigh of relief: "I regret it."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Lord has forgiven all your faults." Father Peter said that he also looked at Meyare, and a few seconds later, his expression was complicated and he could also say that he grew up. The child reached out and asked him to kiss the Bible and the cross. During the time, Father Peter’s fingers touched Maya’s forehead, and the Forehead’s forehead was smeared with greasy, cold and biting. Father Peter suddenly felt very cold. He asked the people on board to pull him up. The boys who had just boarded the boat leaned over and untied the bow. Rope on the Iron Ring - According to the tradition of Poseidon Island, this rope that was once wrapped around the frame of Christ is unlucky and must remain in place, waiting for the sea to corrode it. It wriggling into the dark blue sea like a sea snake—the sea is deep and bottomless, people avoid their sights just as they avoid some terrible omen, not looking at the last place of the rope. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The oars fell and rose again, and the boat quickly left the frame of Christ and the people above it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s too cold," said Father Peter. "Who is bringing wine?" The paddler carried a bottle of local wine and cheese with him. I passed it one by one, so that after two rounds, they finally felt much better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is shining, waiting for them to return to the shore, the sun has become very bright, the sea is like a layer of gold and diamond powder, bright It’s daunting to look straight, the salty sea breeze that blows the body becomes warm and soft, Father Peter does not wear shoes, he walks barefoot on the beach, and the small pieces of the shell are embedded in the thick shackles of the soles of the feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boys dragged the boats ashore, they don’t go home for a while, a makeshift seaside cottage stocks wine, meat and bread, poker and music Take them for a few hours of wear and tear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They must wait until this high tide has passed, go to the Christ to see the results, and then bring the living person or the body back to Poseidon Island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you looking at?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing." Father Peter took back his own far The sight of the place: "The chick," he erected two fingers, "two chicks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wings are not yet, but they are already stumbling, constantly Flap the wings and want to fly to the nestlings at high altitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha climbed the cliff on the beach with Besib. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The edge of Poseidon Island is densely covered with such a cliff, which was originally a complete boulder, but in the thousands of years, day after day After night and night, constantly slamming and slaps its seawater with the most patience and slowness, and insisting on hollowing out its feet, stomach and chest, now it is like a petrified giant eagle stretching out between the sea and the sky. A huge cockroach, Sasha and Besib's shoulders sit against the shoulders and sit on the tip of the cockroach, like two grass seeds stuck to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking over from here, you can see the Christ. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Sasha and Besib are very good. They can see Meyare, recognize his expression, and still have two fists that are pinched from time to time. The sea continues to rise, the sea is pushed by the tide, splashing his face, he Close your eyes and the white foam stays from the tip of his nose. Thick lips squirmed like prayer or cursing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you think he will die?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not good." Sasha replied: "This is a judgment that God can make. Isn't the original intention of Christ's frame?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The companion’s perfunctory response was changed back to Besib’s sad helplessness. glance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But some people don't want him to die." Sasha continued, the crime was conclusive - yes, his biggest fault was the failure - Meiya Lei Yuan should be quietly disposed of, but Chekale did not do that, he gave the blind a chance, a chance that seems to be quite a bit of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins never think that Chegal will be a good old man, if he is, then the person sitting in the "Tang" position now does not It is him, but there are several brothers above Chegal. This decision is likely to be made for some reason or current situation, but will Chegar really let Meyare live? Although it is said that Mei Yalei now seems to have no capital to turn over, even if he survives, he has no chance to inherit the "Tang" status and the right to continue to stay on the island of Poseidon. The accomplices and supporters of the dead will be exiled to a remote area, perhaps on an island in the Western continent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Celegal will not be happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Sasha said, some people hope that Meyer will live. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meyare tried to move his arms and legs and found The chain is not as tight as it seems. He struggles as hard as possible but does not conspicuously struggle. As a matter of course, the chains quickly become slack, and his heels use enough strength to slam on the frame of Christ. The flat place - like most of the reefs in the shallow sea and the metal products left over from the shipwreck, the part of the Christ's frame that has been sunk all year round in the sea is parasitic with shellfish and seaweed, and the concave and convex parts are sharp and slippery, Meyare The heel was quickly cut, the sea salt pickled to stimulate the wound, and the pain made Meyare scream out loudly - but the price paid quite well, he stood firm on the Christ, his hands Turn it up and hold the bar tightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea rose quickly, and Meyari rose his face. This position was not conducive to breathing. He opened his mouth and greedily inhaled the air mixed with droplets and seaweed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tide is surging, pushing his body and pushing it. On several occasions, he almost lost that valuable foothold - if Mei Yalei Not a big man with a stubborn personality, maybe he can't support it all the time. Waiting for the next low tide, it will take several hours. The ripples of water slap on his ear. It used to be a few minutes, the sea did not pass his chin, but he still insisted, although it lasted for several hours. The struggle has made him exhausted and dying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He waited for the ebb tide, and when the sea water fell below his shoulder, Meyare, who kept his eyes closed, sang in his heart with joy:" Look," he yelled in his heart. "Look, the Madonna looks at us in the sky. She will never allow the devil to conspire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meyer's feet had been painfully numb, but as he rejoiced for his own revitalization, new pain rushed into his brain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He instinctively bowed his head and screamed, the sun shining through the clear water, he saw his body floating in the water, and here The sleek, slow-formed, whip marks on the body – like a skilled invisible executioner applying a whip with a very thin and elastic whip. Strings of blisters emerged at a speed visible to the naked eye, some of which ruptured before they were fully bulged, releasing a translucent liquid into the seawater...the great pain they brought to Meyer was forgotten. Everything, his face was distorted, and his unspoken mourning was repeated, his arms and legs twitching wildly and even biting a part of his tongue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the victim of a famous detective, until the end of life, the enlightened Emmanuel flashes in the brain of Meyer’s death, he is straight The body, shouted out the key words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a pity that the person who observed the result will not arrive until an hour later, and his last defense and complaint is unknown, the only proof can be made. Only the scars of his horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A collection of fluffy round brown mucous membranes and fibers that breathe slowly and heavily, carrying deadly stinging cells, more than a hundred feet long The tentacles float freely in the blue waters. The warm water temperatures around Poseidon Island are quite uncomfortable in the Arctic Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean and the North Pacific Ocean, but they are perfectly perfect for the tasks that humans have delivered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
