			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha looked at Chiz with a bit of an accident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chez Carson is one of the few women who can stay in the depths of Sasha's memory - although they don't have a long time to contact, but because of that The "work" relationship, Chiz is like a small needle left in the body of Sasha, usually can hardly think of it, but when it comes to it, it will be a little pain. In his first memory, Chiz was one of the most common in the Western continent, because of peace and wealth, a carefree life and a stupid, soft, unresponsive child, her life, thoughts, The behavior and Besib, and Sasha, and any child on the island of Poseidon are contrary to each other. She has never suffered from the torture of the *, has not tasted the pain of the spirit, and does not know how to immerse herself in death day and night. What is the taste in the shadows - it is the sea god island to fill this lesson. When Sasha met her in Orlosa, Chiz Carson was almost a waste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;du [If the product can be easily quit, it will not be one of the most profitable trades in the world, the understanding of Hopkins In this way, Chiz Carson wants to return to the normal life, at least three years, five years, or twenty years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now she is by his side, no matter if * or spirit is alive and kicking like a big rabbit. However, the innocent and lovely Chiz Carson on Poseidon Island will not be so arrogant to say that there are pen scholarships to take. Although this is correct, even for that girl. They haven't finished drinking black tea. Brian has already handled this matter properly. He lent his bathroom to the victim girl, let her wash her face, comb her hair, make up her makeup, and then hand her over to Chiz, please She sent her back to her room. After all, the room of the female freshman was very close - Hopkins helped him to organize and clean it, and the girl could not control her emotions in the process. I flipped through the whole low table, the carpet was wet, the teacup was broken, and the tiny pieces of gold-grained roads were splashed everywhere. When she was re-care in the bathroom, her reason should have come back a lot, but the traces of eye shadow and lipstick can be seen on the towel, and the floor mat, wash basin and countertop also have a knocked loose powder and a break. Eyebrow pencil nib. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Strange why do I have this?" Brian walked into the bathroom with a piece of newspaper carrying a piece of teacup, and he saw Hopkins studying the box. Only half of the loose powder is left. In the mirror cabinet (hanging above the sink, mirrored, very thin cabinet), there is a whole set of basics. Unopened cosmetics - not drama cosmetics, and not cheap, or even a little extravagant. "I asked my sister to prepare for me," he said, carefully kneading the newspaper wrapped in pieces. “I also know that some girls don’t wear makeup when they are in the dormitory manager. They will never walk around in the corridor or in any public place.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Why don’t they have a female administrator?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Because female administrators will be harassed,” Brian said as usual: “Some boys don’t Willing to appear in front of women is useless and stupid, and they tend to be very arrogant, especially when there are friends and roommates watching." He stuffed the newspaper into a black garbage bag and posted it on the garbage bag. A striking yellow enamel sticker, with a thick and black oily pen on it, "have sharp fragments, be careful!"; coat. Towels, rugs, and floor mats need to be washed. He collects them and throws them into the laundry basket: "It is ridiculous to obey a female boy, and the male administrator is slightly better in this regard." Look at the mirror. It was discovered that Hopkins was watching him. The lighting in the bathroom used a d65 light source, which provided the most sunlight-like lighting indoors and rainy days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins' iris color is very rare - in low light, cobalt blue, in plenty of light and in the sun. It is lavender. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But male administrators should be cautious, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course," Brian said: "You didn't notice that there are two cameras facing you - sorry, I am joking, I am not that generous - but there is monitoring equipment outside, it is not my living room, but It’s my office. I don’t mind being recorded for twenty-four hours. I know that witnesses are not found anywhere, anytime. Girls have complained about male harassment.”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Real?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fake," Brian answered without hesitation: "The guy is a gay, he is Women were completely uninterested, and they later proved that the girl was lying, and later she admitted that she only wanted revenge because the administrator had collected her beer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "What happened to the girl?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She was fired."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So the choice of this girl today is still very correct."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brian paused, "Don’t be like this "He said softly: "She was fired because of alcoholism and non-compliance with school regulations. Manchester has always been very concerned about this - you are also a member of Manchester, Mr. Hopkins, don't let the misunderstanding outside affect You, you should be proud of it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can be sure that my words are from my heart." Sasha said, "No, there is no contempt and disgust, just about things," he said, smiling slightly: "Like you said I also belong to Manchester."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Need help?" another voice said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishb. Bisangdi, his information is also in the black folder that Brian Dupont is not known, his performance is very good, But what makes Manchester's interviewer so excited is the performance of his high school team. He is very big, but unlike the rugby players who are so full of big muscles, his shoulders and chest are really thick. - The khaki dress fits well, but when it is wrapped in the body full of strength, it looks wild. He wears a tight vest in his jacket, and the open light champagne shirt has mossy green and dark brown stripes in the neckline. Silk scarf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the colors that the Poseidon people like, Brian Dupont immediately thought of his identity and the identity of Hopkins... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surname is more than the sangdi and the name Hopkins does not want to be a righteous guardian, which makes Brian Dupont more secure," No," he said. "The room has been cleaned. There are not many things to wash. Is the dance over?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are picking up the dragon," Bu said: "Some people have already returned to the room."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you feel tired, you can go back to the room early," Brian asked for a laundry. There are not many things, but they are a bit heavy: "I want to go for a while, but can you choose to take a lecture tomorrow?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," Sha. Hopkins: "But we decided to go back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So," said Brian Dupont: "Good night." He noticed that West Bu. Bissau did not express his dissatisfaction with Sasha Hopkins’ decision to give him a decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened?" asked Besib. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A small accident," Sasha said, taking off his coat and putting it on the back of the chair. Tonight, he can't use much of his strength. It’s really unpleasant: “too warm atmosphere with too much alcohol, a senior and a freshman, a man and a woman.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib not only took off his coat, but even took off his vest and shirt. He walked up and down the room with his upper body. "This is really a big gift. Is there any bad place here?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For that girl, maybe it is," Sasha said. "But Cason said she will get compensation, scholarships, and more." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Carson?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Qiz Carson." Sasha Anxiang Say: "You should remember her father."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man whose head was knocked out by him, "She also applied to Manchester?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not surprising," Sasha said. "She is Carson. And I saw that she is very healthy and can’t find a little bit of deep addict. Symptoms."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, do you need to check it out?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Check it out." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chiz Carson sent the poor girl back to her own room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She took the sedative to the girl, the weight was small, the girl fell asleep almost immediately, and Chiz put a blanket on her and walked out of the room. She walked out of the dormitory all the time, and when she was blowing in the cool evening wind, she felt much more comfortable - the heat brought by the brandy in the black tea was rolling in her body, or not, her body was so excited, good night. It was because I finally saw Sasha Hopkins and spoke to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is just the beginning. She warns herself, don't be too impulsive, Hopkins is not easy to approach, he is very dangerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but she can’t wait to share this little success with someone, she called the psychiatrist, who was not her mother’s That, she doesn't trust the old wizard. He is a private doctor of Chiz Carson who introduced it to Chiz. He is a handsome middle-aged man who has the same ability as Sasha to be different from ordinary people. He agrees with the idea of ​​a private doctor. In order to quit the effects of drugs on the body, the individual's will is very important, and the individual's will always needs a strong support - Chiz's mother is one, and her father... even John Card Xun is still alive, he is not a responsible good father, this is very clear, her uncle? Don't be kidding, her grandfather, yes, she loves his grandfather, but it is hard for a man who is going to be a trustworthy person to rely on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
