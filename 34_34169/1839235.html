			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is hivc?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Hopkins put down the newspaper and raised it Raising his eyebrows, he was a little surprised. Before that, he never thought of his wife’s twin sister, Sasha’s aunt, who would talk to him actively, and not insult or curse: “Hivc’s full name is the growth hormone inhibitor. Invented seventy years ago, the distance from hiv - artificially produced growth hormone catalyst was born for only three years, so it has been thought that they are twin brothers or sisters produced in a laboratory, indeed, their components Similar is amazing - but their effect is just the opposite, hgh can promote the growth and development of biology, but hivc can control and suppress it, very interesting, they all work in the same way, are deceiving, the former can wake up The pituitary cells that secrete growth hormone urge them to restore their output, while the latter will 'tell' the pituitary cells. Its work is over and you can sleep comfortably..." He smiled and made a Gesture: "Well, it goes to sleep, and the development and growth of the creature is naturally interrupted. Some people use it on animals that have not grown up, artificially making teacups, saucers and pygmy horses." - Their value will be doubled by hundreds, and animal protectionists are indignant. They try to stop the spread of the drug. They think of many ways. The last biologist proved that it Not only for animals, but also for humans - the courts supported their assertions that hivc is considered illegal in three-fifths of the Western continent, and that sales and use are subject to three to five years. Imprisonment, oh, I mean, used on animals.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He blinked curiously: “Why, have you received any special gifts? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it possible to reverse?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins turned his head around Oh, he saw a bunch of bright grapes on the plate. He cautiously picked and picked a fruit that was hidden behind other fruits, small and bruised, in front of the gray eyes: "Do you think it can still go back to the vines and continue to grow up? Yes, the unfortunate consequences of hivc can be reversed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Thank you," Catherine said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please also answer a few questions." Dr. Hopkins stopped her: "In view of my answer to your question, Catherine, I I want to know what you are thinking, what do you feel? I mean, little Sasha, you are surprised and angry when you see him. Although it is only a short moment, you can control yourself now, which is good. Catherine, but what surprised me was that you didn't actually say and did anything later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you think I should do?" Catherine asked: "Kid him, threaten him, beat him ass? Mr. Hopkins, the wood has become a boat. Sasha is already fourteen years old, and I already know my previous practice. It’s wrong,” she hesitated for a moment: “...I know what to do now.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“So, the second question,” Anthony Ho Pukins said: "Who are you asking me for this question? Xi Xi, yes. Or not?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine was silent for a few seconds:" "."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey," Hopkins said: "The last question, but you don't necessarily need to answer. This is just a reminder, except hivc, she What did you say to you?" As a ghoul, he was very happy to see his enemies have such a dragged guy, but now they are standing on a boat. He has to think more carefully, especially when his lovely hungry little Sasha is also in his place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine is more than her sister. Hopkins's wife still has trouble - she always swayed back and forth on the line, hesitating, her sense of justice is not enough to fight her selfishness, but when she is selfish, she will have mercy because she shouldn't have it. After sympathy and foresight, at some point her fragile and vulnerable, sometimes impulsive and irritating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...She said something to me," Catherine swallowed: "...but I don't think it matters."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So she lied, she lied to Xiqiao. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She promised Xi Xi, let her escape at a suitable opportunity, in fact she would not, she and the bodyguards and Gregory are a group They will not allow Xiqiao to slip away from the palm: "What do you think will happen after Xiqiao?" She asked hesitantly: "This is her last performance."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Her record revenue has accumulated to match the foreign exchange reserves of a small country," Hopkins said slowly. "And her admirer gave it to her." Gifts, those that can not be taken by Gregory, villas, yachts, private jets and even land, she can comfortably spend the rest of her life, interested in words, she can also write memoirs, book and shoot to She is the protagonist's movie; after Gregory withdraws her insurance, she can also marry a man, she can't give birth herself, but she can adopt a whole group of children, she can afford them - her way It’s much more than you, Catherine.” He held his temples with one finger. She should be happy, Catherine, who can spend every day in the next 50 years according to her own ideas – something that seven billion people around the world dream of.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you also include you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins glanced at her, indifferent and calm, not including even a trace of fear Something, but Catherine almost took a step back at the same time, she took her hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Hopkins suddenly licked his mouth slightly, and then revealed a dark and unclear smile: "You always make me happy, Catherine "He waved his hand with a look like a cup of expired milk. "The conversation is over. Dear, please turn back and leave my room."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine left the room, and when she crossed the corridor, she met Sasha and Besib. Her nephew was already very tall. "Bishb, this is Catherine, my mother's Sister." He leaned his head and introduced the boy with dark skin around him. Catherine smiled at them and Bessie returned with a pretty sweet smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where are you going?" Catherine tried to make her voice sound less harsh. She read the book and knew that boys of this age were the most disgusting and Surveillance: "I want to ask you to go fishing...and crabs." She pretended to unconsciously reach out and touch the face of Sasha gently. The boy's face was cold and wet. He did not escape. Catherine breathed a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No," Sasha said. "We don't have much time. After dinner, we have to rehearse."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's a shame." Catherine said: "I'm sorry," the answer was too fast - she found the problem herself, so she took a deep breath and saved it. Added: "Xi Xi seems to have not attended the rehearsal - I thought..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, she doesn't need it," Sasha smiled, this In a few days, Gregory was simply using Naxi to be a model for declaring the ultimate life that humans can achieve. She is as tall as a goddess. Everyone has to move her thoughts and arguments, she can do whatever she wants, and feel free to do it - even the recordings have to look at her mood. Outside the recording room, her assistant and babysitter served with various things, soda and soft couches were brought into the concert room. She screamed at the microphone and almost ruined the sound engineer's ear. She put an ashtray. Throwed on the face of the makeup artist. Almost broke her nose. She didn't want to participate in the rehearsal. Gregory gave her a substitute. He asked the substitute to act as a Xiqiao on the stage, and then recorded the entire rehearsal and brought it to Xiqiao. She only had to take part in the last rehearsal. Specifically when it comes to the concert. The director, the band and other staff will do their best to match her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Do you feel a little envious?” Besib said that he has been immersed in the sun-heated sea for a few days, and the skin has turned black again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not a good treatment..." Sasha put a small, crumpled but very delicious baked apple into his mouth: "That will be a Good reason."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gregory may be able to take this Prove that she is. She still suffers from mental illness," Hopkins said thoughtfully: "But that may be good... Gregory will find her the most beautiful sanatorium, where it calms down. It’s been a few decades since I’ve been there.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib’s fork was inserted into the little strawberry cake, “is it because of money? "He drums his cheeks and tries to swallow the little cake with three inches square." Xiqiao was judged to have no civil capacity. The laws of the Western Continent stipulate that such a person should protect her personal, property and other legal rights by her guardian, except for the benefit of the ward. The guardian may not deal with the property of the ward. Oh, please note that, in other words, if he does not harm the interests of the ward, he can control the property. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes," Dr. Hopkins said: "The assets of Xiqiao have been increasing in value. Gregory is good at avoiding danger and knows how to get it right. Adventure.” He took the newspaper that covered the entire face, let it stop at the chin, and made a small face. “That’s a lot of money.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What stupid thing did she do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Xi壬 managed to find a famous psychiatrist and psychoanalytic theorist Prove that she has recovered," Sasha said. "She almost succeeded. If she succeeded, she would get back nearly 1.5 billion yuan of real estate, investment, shares and songs from Gregory. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is nothing in that Gregory." Hopkins said: "He has spent a lot of effort to put this. "Things are flat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you want me to say, he is really jealous of his name," Besib said, Xixi’s business he listened to. Sha said, the silly broker should have hands - he really curious about is how over the past few years, protoss not a good deal, and the ability of the West Wang pervasive, as long as she can speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
