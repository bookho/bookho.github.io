			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This "prank", which can almost be called murder, disappeared silently into the tributaries of Grande, no one to mention, also No one cares, even those students and teachers who know a little about this or know more about it, all they can do is say: "God bless - that is a lucky child." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucky? Bessib. Bissand doesn't feel at all. If his physique is not different from ordinary people, the drugs mixed in the beer will make him completely faint. He will float on the water and let the clothes drench. The shoes and the ineffective life jacket dragged him into the deep water and lived to death... Even if he woke up in time, without the help of Sasha Hopkins, he could not climb out of the cold grave, Besib clearly I remember every feeling at that time, it was a minute and a second to watch the death gradually approaching - if not for personal experience, the heirs of the thug leader would never have thought that they would get in this seemingly peaceful and peaceful place. Such feelings... He admits that he is afraid. He is only fourteen years old. Although he has already killed people, he still does not want to die. He does not want to lose everything, bury it in the soil and rot with the locusts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha. Hopkins does not feel that if he ignores the reminder of Dr. Douglas? If he is as silly as a blind ordinary student, waiting for the teacher to give a result, or at the last moment, can't open the door... Besib. Bissau will be able to escape – everything is late. Everything is irreparable - he thinks he is used to human life as a wind-blown candle, he thinks that as long as he is willing, he can protect anyone he wants to protect, but it turns out that he It was a big mistake... He couldn’t help but be paralyzed when he thought about it. In the next few days, he and Besib slept in a room. He listened to the breath of his friends all night and could not sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little Hopkins never missed his father as he did now. He didn't know if Besib was thinking this way too. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the sea god island, they only temporarily hide their fear and resentment, press them under the tongue, swallow their stomachs, let them pass by The time slowly ferments and eventually makes a sweet revenge... It doesn't matter, they know how to wait and grasp the opportunity - there is time, the boys soon discover that they have little time - the most important one of the year The exam was scheduled for thirty-four days later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every second is a good use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every student at Grandry. New students, including the ninth grade, have fallen into a religious enthusiasm and perseverance, and everyone is rushing. The face was serious, the tables and chairs in the library were crowded, and some people took books at lunch and dinner. The teachers’ faces lost their smiles, and even Mr. Neek, who guided the compulsory courses, began to get nervous. Get up - Besib's tutoring work was handed over to the teachers of various subjects, and Sasha Hopkins was finally able to get out. Returning to his own book with no worries, his "Nine Weeks Examination" has achieved a whole, and the teachers hope that he will do the same in the final exam in June. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the more comfortable Hopkins, Besib. Bissau is miserable, perhaps because of his body, "Sasha. Huo The relationship of the labels of the Pugins friends, the teachers even had a great expectation for him. They not only asked him to make up his previous homework, but also tried to make him want to go further. Then at least one-third or one-half a. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are crazy at all!" Besib complained loudly, after school at 3:30 in the afternoon, the football team trained for three hours, after dinner, he still had Do the homework for four hours. Can I go to bed? How can it be! There is also an hour of nightingale tutoring - the teachers have divided his entire night, and Saturday and Sunday: "I remember who told me. The middle school of the Western Confederation is like an amusement park for Halloween! No homework, If you don't have an exam, whatever you like, you can try your best. The teachers will give you a good score!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's a pity," Sasha did not raise his head and said that he was doing historical assignments - repairing a 16th-century map of the Pope of the Western Continent. "This is a matter of ten years ago. Since the last president, Mr. released, don't give up. After a child's law, the education system in the Western continent became strict and strict. Teachers no longer have lifelong qualifications. Our graduation scores and the success rate of applying for universities are directly linked to their salary, performance appraisal and even qualifications. Hook, with vagueness, casually, letting go, the course is canceled, the guests are gracious, the generous transcripts and recommendation letters are gone, leaving only one hundred and forty-four The school bag and 90 minutes each, a four-day class, and a 45-minute lunch break." He twisted his neck: "There are four courses of homework... team training... and tutoring Yes, dear, only you.” The line of charcoal pens was carefully erased: “In addition, I think I have to make you a preparation. Mr. Nenet talked to me this morning, we There are still too few clubs to participate in. Besib, a better university will ask his students to participate in more than two clubs - in the application, the experience of a sports club is too thin, after the end of the final exam We must choose another one. Well, the more literary associations have joined - I have chosen one, what do you like, music or painting?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib took a deep breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If we tell that old man than the old man," he asked with hope: "Do he allow us to go back?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 9 pm, I hurried back to the swimming pool locker room because I forgot my mobile phone Miss Marcia, who was searching, faintly heard the sound of water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The training activities of the swimming team members are generally arranged from 5:30 am to 7:00 pm, from 4 pm to 7 pm, just two hours before Miss Marcia The last team member was urged to leave the swimming pool, inspected the locker room and the bathroom, and closed the door and window with his own hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishb. It’s not long before the sangdi’s things, the teachers’ nerves are still tight, she is immediately vigilant, but fortunately because she is happy In the evening, I will also travel to one or two full-time relationships in the evening. She always carries the keys with her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pool's water waves reflect the moonlight from the skylight, and a slender trace breaks through the silvery water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pale body jumped out of the water, the head pressure was very low, and the slender arm opened like a butterfly's wings on the water. Immediately and forcefully pressed into the waves, the thumbs down, the posture is correct and beautiful. Miss Marcia frowned slightly, took off her high heels and walked barefoot to the front of the starting block. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The swimmer neither wore a swimming cap nor waterproof glasses, and when he once again smashed into the water towards Marcia, she exclaimed: " Boa!" The effect is like playing a thunder indoors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baoer stopped, he did not return to the starting block, but drilled through the floating belt. Swim to the side of the pool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He reached out to the edge of the pool and waved to Miss Marcia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing?" Marcia said harshly: "Do you want to increase the intensity of training without the permission and supervision of the coach? You know the worst." What is the result?” Her voice shook the entire swimming pool: “You are committing suicide!” She stood up and looked around: “God. Only you alone! If your legs are cramped, or because... ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss Marcia," Boa lazily interrupted her, and he continued to wave her hand and signaled her to come over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Marcia holds her arm. Standing there, the treasure did not move, Boa showed a poor look, his hair wet, close to the cheek, chin and a little baby fat - Miss Marcia sighed, her heart softened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is my tour?" Boa said: "You just saw it. I changed the old problem, it is not easy." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Marcia made several deep breaths and she wanted to continue to get angry. But I can't do it: "Boa," she lowered her voice. "How can you do whatever you want? You haven't thought about even a minute. Think about it, if you have something wrong, your parents... And uncle, how much more will they be sad?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They won't." Boa said with a smile that is very uncomfortable. "Uncles don't care at all. And my parents probably only think it's a waste of time for me to hold a funeral."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To be honest. Miss Marcia said with a wink, "I really want to apply to the principal. - You are such a small bastard, obviously need a rattan to wake up and teach you a trick."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baoer made a face, "I am sad," he said, holding his chest: "I am doing it for you, but you have to beat me for others, oh, beauty." Child, I tried my best, but I couldn't even get a little praise."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought there was more than half of the grid. De screaming for you is enough.” Miss Marcia squatted down, like every time in the past, Boa touched her toes, and the slender fingers were like taking out from the refrigerator. of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You should come out." Miss Marcia said: ‘I have to take you to the medical office first. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She reached out and Boa escaped: "I haven't been rewarded yet, Marcia, I am waiting for you, let you know first." But nothing was obtained - except scolding and a threat. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Marcia looks at her. She has a date today, wearing a deep blue-blue tight skirt, her knees are tightly tied, and the steps are bigger. Subject to constraints.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
