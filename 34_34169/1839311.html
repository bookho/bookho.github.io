			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have been walking for three hours, taking a break every half hour, near noon, the Boy Scouts arrived at their scheduled camp, a flat rock beach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat boy of the Douglas squad panted and his face turned white. He immediately threw his backpack on the ground as soon as he was sure to rest, then bent his knees and clumsily With a kind of desperate and comfortable look on it - the fat backpack made a squeaking sound, and many things fell out of the gap that was not tightened, and a boy scout used a three-knife hop It fell to the head of the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the team picked up the knife and went to the front of the fat boy. The other two of the Douglas team put their arms into his armpit and took him. Pulled up: "No... no," he said palely, stuttering: "I'm sorry... I'm really... (he took a breath) too tired." His head, especially the top of his head The itching is so powerful that too much sweat is concentrated in the hat. He thinks that it is similar to unconsciously raising his hand and taking the hat, and the other hand is stretching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His hand was caught by a hand, now is the brightest day of the day, the adult man can look down at the top of this fat boy without looking down, furry The brown short hair bulged a few crimson cockroaches, as big as the soy beans. He tried to touch it, soft, and then carefully observed, there were eight legs around the soft bag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you ever put your hat down and lying in the grass?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fat boy With a wink, he did, and this is what the head does not allow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the group pulled the boy closer and looked at the things again. "It’s a locust." Fortunately, they only walked one morning, there was a car. The village is not far away. He discussed with another volunteer for a while and decided to escort the boy back to the village. There were cars in the village and they could return to the city by car. Let the doctor in the hospital find a way to get rid of the mites on the top of the child's head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There has never been a locust here," another volunteer said. He looked at other children with a little hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will let them check each other." The head said: "If there is another child bitten by a locust, I will announce that the training ends early. , take them back. Do you need a stretcher?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The volunteer shook his head and he was also a strong man. Although this kid is strong, if he needs to carry him for three hours, there is no problem at all. The head of the team walked over and touched the fat boy's forehead. Fortunately, he had not started to have fever and joint pain. He knew what he was bitten, and his panic made his face full of tears and sweat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat boy who took the pump was taken away by another volunteer. The head of the team ordered all the teams to enter the tent that he and the instructor set up temporarily. Take off your clothes and check each other for black or red cockroaches that suddenly come out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Douglas team has only four people left, they are the fastest, the head of the team went to Boa. Douglas. I sniffed carefully, and they only had a smell of mint and pepper. The Hopkins ointment did not have this smell, and the insecticide containing DEET did not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why don't you use insecticides?" Hopkins's ointment is not standard equipment after all. The team leader only found that it is more effective than insecticides after trial. a little. I will recommend it to the children. If Douglas refuses to use it, he will not say anything, but the insecticide has been ordered from the beginning, and each child will be sprayed once in a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I told them not to use it," I was the master in the forest, and Boa said in his heart: "I have better things for them." That fat man is just too stupid. It is too lazy, otherwise he can be as safe as others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will deduct your score," the head said seriously. "Now you are spraying insecticide right away. Also," he turned to the team of the Douglas team. "Are you sure you want him to be the captain?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other three children did not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," the head said: "I hope that you can do better in the days that follow. Otherwise I will report to you, cancel your Medal of Medicine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Boy Scout members have drilled tents and found no second locusts, so that the children are sincerely happy and relaxed. Laughing at each other's white ass. The ribs and the wide pelvis, a boy who had a strange birthmark on his body caused a lot of speculation by his team members - some thought it was the scaffolding left by the alien after landing on him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A boy was always standing next to the tent. He was not a student of Grande. He was ruthlessly stopped when his players turned into tents and checked each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head looked at him, an unspeakable pain on the serious face flashed, even Besib and Sasha were almost Can catch, he strode to the boy who was excluded by his teammates, dragged him into the tent with his shoulders, and ten minutes later, he took the boy out and took him to Boa. Douglas, " This is your new team member," the head said quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baoer breathed a sigh of relief, but there was no objection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His team members are very welcoming this new member, although they can’t be too obvious, because this guy obviously knows the head of the team, the head of the team put him Come in, it is estimated to monitor Boa, don't let this guy who wants to do more mistakes, which is good for them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little panic caused by the locusts soon passed, only delaying the time they cooked, and the children took out the chocolate and got permission. The biscuits, the captain and their assistants were responsible for picking up the appropriate pebbles on the beach and building a few stone stoves that could only be placed in a small stainless steel pot for boiling milk. Then boil water from the river - this rocky beach is full of all kinds of large and small stones, but fortunately most of them are washed by the river, are round pebbles, here is the Grand River In the middle and upper reaches, the river flows through the valley and passes through a flat land. The water is slowly and lightly lit, crystal clear like pure glass, with the fragrance of vegetation - the children put chocolate and cheese inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were parents who only allowed a small amount of drinking water for Scouting activities, and most of the water was taken from the Grand River, expressing concern and suspicion, but Grande The organizers of the Boy Scout Association insist on this because they feel that since it is a field survival training, it is ridiculous to bring a box of cola and orange juice. Their main purpose is what each child needs. They are all in their own backpacks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the issue of water withdrawal, the Boy Scouts organization ended up with a water quality report. The Grand River originated from the Snow Mountain and traveled between the mountains. There are no reservoirs or factories in the upper reaches. As long as they are boiled, you can drink them with confidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, like this long journey of up to a week before and after, the organizers will not stupidly let the children bring their own seven-day rations, they At the middle of the day (about the third day), a supply point was set up in the middle of the monastery. The devout monks were very willing to receive the innocent children. They said that they made their own sheep cheese and wild pork. And the raspberry jam is very delicious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I saw shrimp, swarms of shrimp, each with a finger length," Besib lowered his voice and said, "There are crabs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I brought a small bottle of vodka." Hopkins whispered that there are also streams on the island of Poseidon. The shrimps and crabs in the stream are smaller than the ones in the sea, but they don't have a delicious taste, plus wine and salt. It is very good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There will be fly fishing in the afternoon." The third subtle voice said: "You all have the Fly Fishing Medal and will be allowed to participate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib has long felt that someone is swaying around, it turned out to be this little guy - a new member of the Douglas squad, almost as tall as they are, but very thin From the side, it looks like a mannequin made of wood, and the shoulders are slightly embarrassed because of this disproportionate growth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slender eyes look very clear, like the river not far away, the brownish iris reflects the face of Hopkins, in him Under the watchfulness, the boy lowered his head in distress, and he was surrounded by a bucket with water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am just..." The boy with brown eyes continued to use his subtle voice: "I... I have been here for a few years, I mean, If you have anything to know, you can ask..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ask me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The head of the group stood behind the boy, and the thick black eyebrows were knotted in the center of the eyebrows. His mouth was tight, his arms were hugged on his chest, and his chin was stretched forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have any questions to ask me," said the head. "And Charlie, you should go back to your team,"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie stood up and saw that he was afraid of this man. "My name is Charlie." He took the courage to say, ignoring the fierce eyes of the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Besib."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sasha." Sasha said: "I am very happy." I know you, Charlie, but as the head of the group said, you better not to go too far with us," Charlie’s face was a bit whitish because of this sentence, and the head of the head, than Sangdi and Hopkin The strange expression that Sis had seen appeared again. "Because your little captain Boa. Douglas hates us," Sasha said with a smile: "He will tease people."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
