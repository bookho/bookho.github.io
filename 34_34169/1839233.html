			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib is not the first time to listen to Hopkins playing the plucked piano, but he never listened so "near" - Sasha I used to work hard for his music. Besib thanked his friends, but he had to tell him that he believed that his destiny was contrary to music. The little arrows shot by the light ass were lead, they always It is impossible to fall in love - he has already found tens of thousands of music appreciation papers to deal with music lessons in the next decade. In the end, Hopkins had to admit his failure, and Besib could not even distinguish the difference between rock music and symphony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If someone is paying attention to Besib now, he will find that the boy’s face is unusually dignified, and the dark skin reveals an unusual blush, he re Stand up, make a fist with both hands, his body is slightly undulating under the clothes, and the skin and muscles are changing their state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately everyone’s attention is now on the tapes played on multi-track recorders, and it’s been a long time until Sasha Hopkins leaves the piano, After knocking on the glass, they were able to get rid of the control of these two voices and return to the real world. The sound engineer said to the ensemble: "We have to call Gregory to listen to this. Also, look Can you put that lazy, what is his name, in short, the one who is responsible for the adaptation of the music - go, if necessary, you can kick his ass, two days, his waking time is not sleeping A quarter of the room! Tell him, we told him not to waste champagne and whiskey!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chorus ran away, the door of the concert room Open, Hopkins came out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishb handed a bottle of cola, the sound engineer subconsciously stopped, and immediately he realized that he was awakened: "I'm sorry," he said: "I thought it was Singer, the singer doesn't recommend drinking Coke when recording."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't matter," Sasha picked up a pack of soft-packed lemonade: "This is very Ok." Someone took another chair and let the two boys sit together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha took the hand of Besib. The heat and soft touch awakened the son of the thug leader. He looked at Hopkins. The obvious shock was undecided. His fingers were slightly deformed under the shadow of the shadows, and they gently scratched the palm of the hand like a feather brush. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"西壬?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib looked at Sasha's eyes. His eyes looked black like in the dim light. Only the edge of the circle was nearly translucent dark purple. He first nodded and then shook his head again. "No, it's you. The mix of you and Xiqiao, it feels... very unbearable," he racked his brains to find an adjective. He clenched his friend's hand. The familiar feeling and smell made him calm down, his blood stopped, his muscles no longer undulating, his skin tightened again, and Besib gave a deep breath. "Great," he whispered. "It's much better now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins look at other people, Gregory and the responsible music The adapted young people have arrived, and they began to listen to the tape again. From the expression, nothing but a little surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s like a footstep." Gregory does A conclusion came out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes." The guy who was responsible for the adaptation of the music came in and was confused. But in a few seconds, he became awake and professional, and he took off his headphones. "This is not the case. It is still a recording. When the live broadcast is live, all the audience will be shocked."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then let them scare one "Hurry up," Gregory said. "This is exactly what we want."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Most people will be unacceptable - I am Said. This sound is too direct, too pure. It can be compared with a dagger - why not use the original player? His performance is also very good, and ... not so, then, then, um Cruel, listen to this voice, pluck the sound of the ancient piano, yes, I know that the plucked piano has no reverberation, but you listen to this voice, it is too clear, too direct, full of persecution, it can not Softening and weakening the voice of Xiqiao, but as a competitor... Xiqiao’s voice will become more crazy because of its stimulation – remember the problem we discovered when we first recorded the Xiqiao? Too...so scared... Mr. Corso, I can’t imagine them the most "It will become what it looks like."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I remember," Gregory said: "At that time you convinced me that we filtered and modulated the West The song, then mix the sounds of percussion, bass, electronic piano and saxophone, let them fit tightly, and then sprinkle them between the sounds of the scorpion like sprinkling coffee on the tiramisu, lest Our audience is schizophrenic because of the excessive impact." He stroked his chin: "But I also told you that I really like the original voice, it is as clear and simple as crystal." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The record sold for 500,000 copies!" The music adaptor proudly said: "This is the last performance of Xiqiao, it may be possible to sell 800,000!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's possible, but this time I am the owner. Xixi likes him," Gregory changed to touch his throat. "I also like it, he is the only one who won't be jealous." Covered and driven players, you are right, they will compete with each other, but why not? They will present the best side for the audience," he put the voice low, "I am happy to see it." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound engineer shook his head in disbelief behind Gregory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's it," said Gregory. "Maybe we can go to the field to rehearse a little earlier."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I said," after Gregory left, the syndicate said: "Is Gregory Corso buying huge insurance for the success of this performance?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The live performance is not on the "eyebrows", it is impossible, where can not accommodate 56,000 spectators . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory specially built a concert venue for the last concert of Xiqiao, which is the one that Besib and Sasha saw on the helicopter. The inverted pyramid building has an empty interior with a total of 60,000 seats. The seats are lightweight silver metal with armor and chair covered in black faux leather. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xi's concert table is located at the tip of the pyramid, the bottom of the building. The stage is filled with sparkling water, three from the nearest auditorium. Ten feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This helps them to wake up in a hurry." Gregory joked that his voice was already low, but there was still a flaw. The echo came. "You will be here too," he walked to the corner of the stage: "At a given moment, the stage will spin, don't be afraid, it won't turn very fast, and your piano and chair are fixed, you want It’s much more comfortable than West, dear, you can sit.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins looked up and the top of the inverted pyramid was a quadrangle, which was difficult to estimate at one time. Its area, which is made up of countless pieces of glass, is connected to the glass by stainless steel connecting claws, completely transparent, from which the sky can be seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not visible from the outside, the four sides of the pyramid are hollow, and there is a high-pressure water spray device at the end. The device can spray the filtered seawater to the sky, which forms a transparent tetrahedron in the air, and the 3D image is in the air. Formed in a transparent tetrahedron, people will see a tall, modern building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are 3D holographic three hundred and sixty degree projection devices," said Gregory. "You have seen it a few days ago, the real three." Hundred and sixty degrees, Xiqiao, and everything on the stage, will be projected in the sky hundreds of feet, people from dozens of kilometers can also be seen with the naked eye, plus these people, the audience of this concert will More than ever before - the current record is 1.5 million in a park. The agent sent a scornful voice from his nose: "Think about it, how many we will have, two million Three million, four million? One tenth of the West Coast belongs to us, and there will be countless people dumping it regardless of the video transmission and news reports."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha smiled politely. "There is no perfect ending than this." He said that Gregory could not see what he wanted to see from his eyes. He continued to work hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no more perfect start than this." Gregory pointed out: "Hopkins, not all actors or It’s the singers who have to go under that. There are many people who have gained a wide range of influences and great success for the first time. People admire them and love them. No one dares to insult and bully them because they Already belong to the entire human race - no one can own them alone, every idiot that wants to stretch their claws will be curbed by more powerful hands - they are always carefree, free, even if they No longer acting and singing, the glory of the past will shine on them. They can go to college, go to the army, go to politics or business, no matter what, they must be smooth sailing. After a few years, they may still be in love. Married, raising two children and adopting one or several orphans. Later, they died at the end of their lives and were buried in the cemetery behind the church. People built white marble monuments for them. The marble monuments always have bright fresh And small gifts, their names will be recorded in the alumni record and the community records kept by the library. It is also possible that they will be willing to write a book with many readers and long-term influence. People will remember their names for one hundred years. Even longer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly turned around, his eager gaze could melt the cold, hard metal stage: "Is it willing? Are you willing?" He said: "All that is in front of you is at your fingertips."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
