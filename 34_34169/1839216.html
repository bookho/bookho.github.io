			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a light and sweet scent in the extraction room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doctor Douglas comfortably lies on one of his favorite soft chairs, he half-closed his eyes, his hands hanging under the armrests, the dark curly hair clinging The white marble-like forehead - this room is not as comfortable as he showed it, it looks like a furnace, and it is thick and humid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many pipes in the room, they are curved, thick and thin, but with a rhythmic The sense of order, some of them are made of steel, others are transparent hoses made of rubber, plastic or other materials, one end is connected to the heating equipment, and a large amount of water vapor is rushed through the pipe into a 10-foot square block. In the upper part of the cylinder is glass, which allows people to observe the situation - there is a large half of the pot of gardenia, which forces the gardenia to evaporate the last scent, and the lovable ingredients are blended. The steam, through the twisted and downed pipe, enters a condenser surrounded by ice water. The steam is liquefied and falls into the water. The treasures it carries are also condensed at low temperatures. They are greases that can float to the surface. At intervals, the machine will automatically filter once, leaving grease and releasing residual water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These oils are the fragrances that people are fascinated by, and each droplet collects the essence of hundreds of flowers, using them It must be blended at the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas reached out and touched his lips. The smell in the air made him feel awkward. He opened his eyes and satisfactorily looked at the machine in front of him. It was ugly. And it's easy to reminiscent of human internal organs - the mouth, throat, esophagus, stomach, intestines - but its final product is not as stinking as humans, but the opposite is true. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone is knocking on the door, only one knuckle, the sound is weak and can't exceed the sound of boiling steam passing through the pipe, Douglas is a bit unhappy The ground frowned. He was silent, and after a few minutes, the voice appeared again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well," Dr. Douglas complained: "You won, come in, Jane."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Jane walked in happily, we have described it before, she is a beautiful woman, with beautiful facial features and full breasts. The waist is slender, but the buttocks are small but full of elasticity. The most fascinating thing is her hands and feet. There are also wrists and ankles, white, soft and compact, which fully meets the requirements of the nobles for perfect women a thousand years ago. Her hair is always tightly tied and then put together, now being fluffy The ground was put down. Her face looks like it is surrounded by a flame between golden and flaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her left hand holds a bottle and the other hand holds two glasses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have to remember to add water. Doctor." She said, "especially in such a room."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;She poured a glass of wine to Douglas, full of it, and poured a cup of himself, "I wish health." Douglas lifted the cup: "I wish health." He slowly moved the cup to his lips. . Slightly sip, the Chablis from the traditional southern wine region has no sweetness, but it has been infiltrated by the scent of gardenia at the moment. Douglas felt that he was drinking a mixture of grapes and flowers - he connected and drank a few mouthfuls, drank the wine, and threw the cup into Jane's arms (she jumped agilely), and Douglas completely relaxed. The body, he opened his limbs. Waiting for the effect of alcohol to reach the brain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you feel hot?" He heard Jane say that his neckline was untied. Jane’s fingers are always so dexterous, and the warm fingertips are suspended above the skin, like a lively little fish, and quickly swim into the shirt: “You have to cool down.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But," Douglas said, "Dear Jane, you are doing something that makes me hotter." He frowned slightly, as if he was a little dissatisfied - Jane was too familiar with him. She knew that he was not really upset or unhappy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The finger left, Jane stood in front of Douglas, she took off the assistant doctor’s white robe, naked inside, only a pair of high heels, she held it with one hand Wall, bend your body and take off your shoes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are really daring." Douglas said that the bottle was hidden in the clinic, and the clinic and the extraction room were a public In the courtyard, the trees are covered with white fragrant flowers. The students like to go here for a walk or study. From that end to the end, it takes a few minutes, and Jane walks over like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When you are ready, you will not be afraid of everything." Jane drank the remaining wine in her cup, her face was red, her eyes sparkling, very charming "Give me a seat, how? Douglas?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please, of course, please," Douglas said: "Does anyone refuse?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zhen laughed, laughing with a small finger holding his lips - the long red hair shook under the pale fluorescent light, she went back In front of Douglas, she sat in his arms without shame, her arms wrapped around the man's neck like a snake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas grabbed her milk/room, slammed the button on the shirt, and the finger of the crimson nail polish bounced on the chest and finally stopped at a scar that was obviously bitten by the female teeth. It came down: "A good insatiable guy," she commented in a mixed sly and scornful tone: "How do you feel? A woman like that?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas leaned over and kissed her breast/head. "That's none of your business." He was indifferent and rude, and it was a sharp contrast to the previous intimacy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zhen’s body was stiff for a moment, she calmed down and pretended to be nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There's still something," she said hurriedly, knowing that Douglas didn't like to be disturbed when dining and zuoai, no matter what: " Boa wants a tea bag and a comprehensive tea bag."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Oh," Dr. Douglas said boredly: "Like what I said before." He kissed Jane's lips: "Give him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8 At the o'clock, the students gathered in the parking lot in the town. The teachers were only one point and the number was full before the driver was informed to drive. When he passed the seats of Besib and Sasha, his footsteps were paused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishb. It’s not easy to see the face of Sangdi. He looks very tired. It seems that he played three whole football games. He couldn't even open his eyes. If it wasn't for Hopkins' quick eyes, he would hit the protective railing directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The follow-up teacher suspected that he had drunk, and he had a big nostril trying to smell it, not smelling alcohol. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The car swayed, and Besib’s head was placed on Hopkins’s shoulder, so he stumbled on it. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone is talking to Sasha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry," a tenth-grade girl leaned over the body from the other side of the seat, her voice was low. "Excuse me? How much chocolate did you buy today?" she said quickly: "If you still have a quota, can you bring us two cans? We didn't realize that we bought too much." She was from a backpack. Take out two jars with a volume of about two hundred grams and shake them. It creaked inside. The shell is printed with a portrait of colored beans, which is a kind of chocolate chip that the students like very much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib sat up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How? We can give some rewards," the tenth-grade girl blinked: "One kiss, one per person, how?" Ok, three, no more." She whispered her lips, it was Zhang Fengrun's full lips, like a fresh cherry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Complete." Besib said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The car drove into the campus and the students got off the bus. According to regulations, their backpacks will be opened for inspection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today's check is particularly slow, calling a person every ten minutes. After the turn of Besib, he knew why. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people waiting in the examination room are not teachers, but they carry instruments and dogs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The things they bought were checked and chocolate beans were no exception. They are extracted a part of the smash of the clip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The instrument and the dog did not respond. He was the last one, and Besib saw a tight-shouldered car teacher with a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you ask what happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The car teacher teaches the Latin of the ninth and tenth grades in the school. Sasha is one of his favorite students. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don’t say to others, it’s not good for you.” He looked around and determined that no one was careful to open his mouth: “Someone reported today The students disguised the banned drugs into chocolate and brought them into the school."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's too bad." Hopkins replied without a change: "Fortunately, the facts Testify, no one is doing that, isn't it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God bless." The Latin teacher said sincerely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adela." Sasha tasted the end and came to a conclusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is that?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not a banned drug." Sasha said "Amphetamines can be concentrated and energetic. According to the Western Center for Disease Control and Prevention, this drug is used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, prescription stimulants, but in the Drug Administration, It is not a banned drug. According to the regulations, the doctor prescribes a child with ADHD. The normal procedure should first meet parents, teachers or other people who can prove the long-term existence of this symptom - but many doctors just listen to the patient's complaints. It’s easy to get a prescription, 30 Adelaide per month, 10 mg per piece, it’s easy to get, it’s not enough, but you can buy it from other students – they should check it tonight. ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why do they want to eat this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thirty after swallowing Minutes can see miracles, it is said that the user’s memory will be like the Jedi’s The sword is so concentrated and sharp, you will feel that you can do anything.” Sasha said: “You want a, you have to eat – for most people, that's it.”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besib throws the real chocolate bean jar in his hand. A little unexpected, they have not thought of looking up the details of him and Hopkins? If they check, they won’t play this old trick tonight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Poseidon Island people often use this trick when transporting drugs - stuffing the passengers’ luggage, they will unwittingly illegally Where the goods are shipped here, wherever they are shipped, in addition to one or two of the unlucky ones, the other basics can safely reach the destination, which is convenient and saves money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two cans are this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, another can is. Pure." Sasha said: "It seems that they are eager to drive us out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not very good," Besib said: "I like it very much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Me too," Sasha said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(To be continued)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
