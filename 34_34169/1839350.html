			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How did you find me?" "Little boy" asked. He is also a good and adventurous person, from where he dared to hide himself and the diamonds less than fifty feet away from Constantine's rivals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He expected what kind of thing Constantine Crowe was, although there was always someone who said that he was an ambitious, thoughtful and dangerous person. - He has long seen that this man is just a cowardly guilty, if this thing is changed to another person, whether it is the "elder" of the Cloven family, "secretary", or those "Iron Taro", even if it is a health care doctor, he will not leave like this. In this critical moment, he still does not dare to confront anyone. This is also a lot of people. I am optimistic about his reasons. Perhaps it is because the first two decades of life have always been a secondary relationship that is not valued. Constantine is always lacking in enthusiasm, doing things to be indecisive, undecided, and people can't help but be discouraged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has no outstanding talent, intelligence, and looks can only be said to be correct, the wife’s decision is simply a drop from the sky, just falls on his head. The beautiful hat on the top, this greedy glory but the heavy ugly hat pressure of this greedy idiot can not breathe, but he is reluctant to take it off anyway - one day he will be broken neck, "small The boy "thinks." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but how did these "Masoy" people find him? In order to ensure that nothing was lost, his whereabouts did not even know the lady. It was a little unexpected to see that Alex was able to come so quickly... Then he thought that the health doctor might be following Constantine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He killed Yelena and her lover two weeks ago and replaced her, and on the night of the diamond he got into the Aboriginal area - - That he found a good place before he started to work on Yelena. Throughout the process, he did not contact anyone and left no clues to follow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, guess?" Father Peter said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Little Boy" grinned. He first carefully moved a step outside. Father Peter smiled at him mercifully, and he immediately ran away. Leave the people of the Sandy and Cloven family in the kitchen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shape of the Yupic people’s wooden houses is very strange, perhaps because they live in the relationship of leather tents, even the wooden houses are a bit like tents. - In the middle is a round hall, the dining table is placed in the kitchen. The trap door of the storage room is on the floor of the kitchen. The room is arranged around the round hall. There is no door between the bedroom and the round hall. There is only one curtain. When it is hot, it is cotton cloth. When it is cold, it is fur. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood in the round hall and thought about whether he would return to the young man's appearance. Oh, forget it, it hurts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to go back." He stood in the old lady's room. According to the thin curtain, the curtain was so thin that even the wind when it was talking could blow it. There were so many people in the house, so long. The old woman can still sleep peacefully inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it?" The person inside did not strangely answer. "When can my grandson come to see me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A week or so." By then, all the woods had been made, the reward of Yuppi’s stupid man The generous temporary worker has also done his head, and he will look at his grandmother in the old time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Little Boy" did not wait until the old woman said something and walked away. Human beings are also an older and more dangerous creature. He stayed with Constantine. Two weeks, he ate dozens of meals with him and drank countless glasses of wine. After ten rounds of bed, he could not find that his closest intimate person had been changed - and this old woman, eyes, ears, and walking like a tortoise, almost directly shut him down Outside the door - if not for him to consider. She took a postcard with her grandson and wrote it to her. She might have used a powerful rifle with a strong firepower to make him a sieve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, she also let him eat the stinky horse meat for two days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the cheese burritos she made were really delicious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alixer took his people and diamonds, and when the people of Poseidon left, a pair of wrinkled eyes looked out of the gap in the cotton curtain they. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of black raven inhabits poplars and pines dotted throughout the Aboriginal area. They are screaming or squeaky, and the feathers are bright, which is the most common type of bird here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deformed abilities think that the whereabouts are mysterious and elusive, but he/she can escape the surveillance probe and the human eye, but can’t escape the sharp eyes. Ravens - this little bird is one of the most intelligent birds recognized by people. Ravens are found in animal carcasses or hard and thick bird eggs (such as ostrich eggs), but they cannot rely on their own When the force tears them apart and cuts them, they call the wolves, wild dogs, and vultures to share them, but when the wolves and dogs tear the bodies apart, their tails will be harassed by the raven until they have to Give up food; the vultures with weaker relative strength will be taken away by the raven after they have opened the eggshell;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They will also cooperate to hunt. When catching a lizard, several raven will return to the hole of the lizard and block its retreat. Other raven will attack the lizard from the nest. After success, it will be responsible for blocking the hole. The raven will come back and share the food with the raven responsible for the capture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At some point, the raven will fly a long way to hide food because their companions will steal food, some smarter crossings The crow will pretend to hide the food to confuse the "thief" in the bird. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides 呱呱咕咕, they can make more kinds of calls, even learn to talk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he was a child, Sasha knew how to summon mice and let them act according to their own wishes. Now he knows more about his own strength. Ravens who are skilled and want to recruit one or two wandering around the hotel to find food are no more difficult than calling a hotel waiter by a regular tenant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Raven is much smarter and obedient than the waiter - a raven quickly called other Ravens, about half a dozen. Eyes, feathers, and claws are all black-black birds that have a meeting on the branches near the hotel, and then they fly away to convey the requirements of humanity. Within an hour, there are Ravens to report that they have seen it. Yelena, they can't estimate the time correctly. I remember that after that, I only "sleeped", "iron", "moving houses", "many" "humans", "mother humans", "blood", "dangerous", and "mother humans" with " Danger"... always with. After it, five Ravens were connected, and they all saw a "human" with "danger", "public humans", "here", "where" - the last raven told The man who made them feel very comfortable, it saw a lot of horse intestines, hot horse intestines, but "dangerous." "Can't get close." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Hopkins guessed what kind of treasure was hidden in the slaughtered horse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person posing as Yelena stole a worth 650 million diamonds, including a hundred grams of half-life, he may be succeeding The latter was put into a small box that could hide it perfectly, but it couldn't get through the talent intuition of the birds and beasts. Even if he saw the big black birds flying in the air inexplicably, they would never have thought that they were sending "small" messages to each other about dangerous goods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest is simply a matter of course. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They don’t want to take the diamonds, especially the one hundred grams. But they got a card that is more important than a 200 million yuan diamond. The shelf life of this card is not long. It depends on when Constantine can support it, but it will be useful to play out at a crucial moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How can they be embarrassed?" Besib asked, knowing that he is one of the rarest elements. The content in the earth's crust is only about one billionth of a mile. Most of the cockroaches used today are synthetic. This metal is very radioactive and harmful. Its toxicity is 250 million times that of cyanide. Just one dust particle is enough to take life. And when combined with inert lithium metal, it becomes the detonator that can make the atomic reaction reach the highest energy - that is, the "lei tube" of the fission weapon that people often say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of this, its output is monitored and the world’s output is only 100 grams per year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Constantine has a hundred grams of cockroaches in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Before that big, this is still a country." Anthony Hopkins said: "The particle accelerator and the nuclear reactor they have, and now these things Even the Cloven family couldn't master it all. These shackles should have been created by an unfortunate fellow. He might want to do a few earth-shattering events—the result was caught by Constantine”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Constantin did not report this, the Presbyterian did not know, Mrs. Crovin did not know," Father Peter said: "Of course, we now know Mrs. Crovin is informed, she not only cut off this wonderful opportunity, but also bite this disobedient scorpion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They Show us good," Sasha said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No! I can't let Mrs. Crowe come in person," Father Peter said happily, looking at the enemy who was once in the nest. The group is a very pleasant thing: "We are not qualified enough. We just need to bring the words back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At the same time, it is also weak," Dr. Hopkins said: "It seems that Mrs. Crowe is very alert and valued for the upcoming war. She does not want to see the Crowwin family must fight on both sides."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
