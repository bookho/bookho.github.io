An interesting gesture: "If possible, try to stay away from Lilithmeer in the recent period." He replied: "It is good for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie blinked, "Of course," she shrugged and said carelessly: "I have already offended her, isn't it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following period of time, as she said, Bonnie has been careful to avoid Lilith Mayer, the most Fortunately, Lilith Mayer’s attention was quickly drawn to the past by others, no, not Betty, not Carrie, not any bunny. Lilith Meyer is concerned about Gucci Hefner - Lisi's status has plummeted since Betty's business - almost no one in the mansion and club will ever obey the command of the invisible queen, Hefner does his best. Possibly cold, no dance, no afternoon tea, no hunting, no gifts, the ceiling of the attached credit card in her hand dropped sharply, even if the two were in a space, Hefner’s eyes rarely fell on her. On the body, this made Lilith Mayer extremely nervous. She knew that the previous incident was indeed unpleasant for Hefner. She had to bow her knees and show her sincerity in all manners - she could not lose Hefner. Without Hefner, she is just a slightly stupid country girl – she knows this very well. Of course, it is also possible that she expects this situation to change after the two officially form a marriage contract, anyway, Gucci Hefner was born and grew up in an old-fashioned, conservative town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Man can do anything wrong, but he has to respect his wife, the mother of the child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lilith's thoughts Hefner may know, maybe don't know, in short, simply "frozen" the wife of the future for more than a month, the sea Fna finally allowed her to show her arms in the club again. Lilith was as charming as ever, but it always felt like there was something separated - like a peacock that was placed on a huge table in the 15th century. The bones are the same, the gemstones in the eyelids are shiny, and the body is full of aroma, glamorous, but cold and stiff. The only thing that is gratifying is that she is no longer so aggressive - Gucci Hefner is still It’s not so windy, but it’s hard for reporters to capture the future of Mrs. Hefner’s hysterical appearance or get some “fun” good news from the maids and guards of the mansion. More often, she will drop her eyes. Close your mouth and pretend that you are a dumb, scorpion and scorpion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girls in the big house have changed a few batches. Betty has become the best escort girl of the month. She has got the cover and insert of the rabbit and received several "invitations". One of the guys is quite famous. The director of the horror film (his favorite is to let his heroine wear the thinnest sexy pajamas to explore in the dark cellar), Hefner is also a green eye for her, she is allowed to stay in the big house, Comfortably enjoy the luxurious bedroom, car, heated swimming pool, caviar and everything else, almost no work - another stay in the mansion over the existing period is Bonnie, because Little Hopkins likes her very much Care, she did not do bad, and it is worth mentioning, Carrie smoothly borrowed Bonnie's beauty fund, plus her own, I can imagine, after a short departure, they can see a brand new The sleek, radiant Carrie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, she basically has nothing to witness. Because of Betty’s business, Bonnie decided to resign after two months and then go back to her hometown. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If she can, she hopes that it will be a month later, so that she can catch up with her mother’s 50th birthday, but I don’t know why, Mr. Hopkins has not been able to Find the right house or babysitter, she can only wait. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Milk?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A quarter cup is OK," Hopkins Politely said: "No need to heat. Do not add sugar, honey does not use."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The psychiatrist sat in the bed of Sasha, the bed was big enough, he took off Lost leather shoes, only wearing socks and tuxedo, black shoulders and white shirt, sitting cross-legged in a soft blanket, holding a foot of Sasha Hopkins in his left hand - he just trimmed his hand for Sasha Nail, now the toenails, Anthony Hopkins is ingenious. He doesn't have to use the nail clippers for children. With a sharp little scissors, he can pruning a total of twenty small nails. It’s neat and clean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie went to the kitchen to take the milk. When he came back, Hopkins was already cooking the last toenail. He changed one hand and grabbed it with his right hand. With the child's foot, the left hand scissors, cleverly put the cut nails into the palm, Bonnie found his left hand as flexible as the right hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Would you like to go out tonight?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, I will be back before four in the morning." Hopkins put down the small scissors. He gently grabbed Sasha's feet and slammed it into the blanket: "Before I came back..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With Sasha." Bonnie said: "You have been going out very often recently."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Required for duty." Hopkins: "But I don't think this situation will be delayed for too long."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha drank milk, brushed After falling asleep, Bonnie soon fell asleep. Bonnie sat at his bed and read the book. She thought that she would be tired after a while. In fact, she was always mentally awkward and developed as a bunny girl for several years. The biological clock didn't adjust so well, Bonnie thought, she felt dry and dry – she went to the bed and looked at Sasha. The child was grinding her teeth gently, but she didn't wake up, she decided to go to the kitchen. Make yourself a low-alcohol blend and add ice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as five minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she walked down the stairs, the LCD screen embedded in the corridor wall was playing a slow, sad rural jazz, a well-balanced (except for being too full The girl on the chest is twisting the smooth body on the screen and flashing the big blue eyes to the audience. It is Betty, the privilege of every favored girl, her image will be ubiquitous for a while - from the big house to the big house Clubs, from TV to magazines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie sighed in the nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light in the corridor changes with the content on the display, and the pattern on the carpet is mottled. Fortunately, this road has been gone many times. She can walk over with her eyes closed and walk over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no one in the kitchen, Bonnie looked at the wall clock on the kitchen wall, and the hour and minute hands were gradually leveling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before returning, Betty in the hallway leaped with enthusiasm. Her chest was like two stimulant bunny, Bonnie lost. Appreciating her interest, she turned her head. On the other side of the corridor was a tens of feet of floor-to-ceiling windows that contained half of the courtyard. Although it was late at night, the landscape lights under the wild roses and beech were still on. The green light beam hits from the bottom up, and the lowest brightness is beyond the interior of the house - this makes the piece of glass no longer like a mirror, Bonnie's vision is very good, she saw the squirrel in the mouth, Low-altitude owls and bats, maybe a little civet... Oh, wait, what is it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wine glass was temporarily put on a marble-edged table. Bonnie gently opened a door and went out. Before that, she kicked off her slippers and the feet were directly on the grass. Through the grass, the grass licks the bottom of her foot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing she saw was two constantly moving, beautiful legs, which were covered by dense grass and wild roses, and had Rose garland and a snake tattoo, this pattern seems to belong to Betty - Bonnie squints her eyebrows, often has a girl drunk when she doesn't need to go out, or uses an anesthetic - if it is the latter, once found Will be driven out, but there are always people willing to try. Bonnie looked around, no one, it was quite remote. The male guards could only patrol the outside. She sighed silently. It seemed to be troublesome. Maybe it was only a few minutes. She just wanted to wake up. Betty, like kicking her ass, kicks her back to her room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie opened the branches that blocked the line of sight and the way forward. She saw two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lilith Meyer is sitting on Betty, leaning down on her body, holding both hands on the shoulders of the little girl, she is intoxicated with her eyes closed, lips Pick up and form a meat horn, the edge of the horn is sticking to Betty's neck for three seconds, or two seconds. In a shorter time, a terrible and absurd scene appears in front of Bonnie— - As Lilith slammed her gangs, Betty's body and face suddenly dried up—like a ripe peach being bitten open, sucking, water and muscles disappearing, and the skin without elasticity was tight. Tightly grabbed the bones, and suddenly relaxed, slipping down in the shadow of the body, the blood vessels under the skin like a snake or a scorpion wrapped around the dry limbs, dry and yellow hair Contrary to the peduncle - in contrast, Lilith seems to have the moisture of the spring water, even in the eccentric green light, Bonnie can see her body is exuding the vitality of young people, she Body and Limb becomes soft, piping hot, smooth, muscle weakness, skin tight, even with a touch of hair on her lips and cheeks, like a just completed development of small cute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lilith gave a satisfying sigh, the youth of the enemy flowing in her body - unfortunately, she couldn’t take so much at once, Lilith I licked my lips and reluctantly returned most of it - sweetness and heat flowed back from the tip of the tongue, like an inflatable doll, and Betty inflated in a blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The things that are taken away will not grow out. After about two to three days, she will gradually produce wrinkles and grow white hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
