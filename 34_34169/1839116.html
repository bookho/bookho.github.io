			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body that exudes a scorching smell suddenly jumped and fell again, falling between the gap between the corpse and the elevator, but only one In the blink of an eye, he stretched out two arms from the insulated bag that was blown by the current, grabbing anything he could touch—the current was flying in the wall of the elevator and his body was constantly being The current is turned on and is absorbed again. The blue-white light is intertwined with a dazzling pattern between the suspected head and the legs. The exposed skin has long ceased to exist, and the muscles are black as dead wood - if it is an ordinary person, then he It must have been dying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he is still alive, he almost completely got out of the bag, he extended his hands to people, his fingers burning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyone can see that he has no resistance, and the person in charge of the action group issued a "stop" order, "We need to live!" He shouted, although he did not know if it was too late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin looked at him, the current was like a slap in the face, twisting the body like a small snake entangled, from this less than four The cubic meter of space receded and slowly retracted from his fingers and soles into his body... The young man’s breathing was a bit heavy, and trying to release these currents could not be said to be difficult for him. But it is not easy to control them flexibly and freely: they have no physical, no intelligence, but are indiscriminate, do not accept any discipline, and want them to obey, they have to take more power than them to suppress, Still have no fear of the pain - the current does not affect him, but the impact is smaller than others. The institution has done research. He has changed his body when he was still a fetus. Martin didn't quite understand the too complicated and professional conclusion, but Jack once explained to him: his body structure is similar to eMule or It is electric eel, most of the body or important organs are covered by a highly insulating structure, and there are many so-called bio-batteries (roplaques) connected in series and in parallel, so that the current can be dispersed without being Injury to the prey while hitting yourself - especially in the case of things with low resistance around, such as water, metal, because the current will always choose the thing with the least resistance, but try not to use the air and what is in it When used... or it will be shorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point Martin remembers is not very clear, he only remembers Jack’s expression when he said this sentence is serious, serious and ridiculous, he only wanted to It was very impatient to go to the ballroom to see the girl who was so easy to hang on. He thought that he could find another opportunity to ask questions at other times. There was always a chance - he never thought that he would lose his brother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack left a deeper mark on Martin’s life than their irresponsible parents. He called Martin to get up, make breakfast for him, and wash his socks. Send him to school, sign him on the transcript, attend every parent gathering and parent-child activities. His first puberty enlightenment was made by Jack. When he first dated with the girl, Jack prepared roses and chocolates. Even he entered the institution - md, this may be their first time, and Jack hopes that he can go to college, but he hopes to get the money and reputation with his own ability, they have been deadlocked for a long time, but finally Or Martin won. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought that he and he sometimes lived like Jack, a mother-in-law, for a long time, until they both got married and had children. He would buy a mansion with dozens of rooms and generously invite his brother to live with him. Jack can use his money, his servant, his doctor, his butler... Of course, wife and lover except. Jack should get it all, he loves his brother, they will live happily together until one of them dies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but not dying at this time, so young, so tragic death, Martin bowed his head, he approached the "corpse" and opened half with his feet The wreckage of the insulated bag on the face, the face has been completely destroyed, but it does not matter, as the largest medical department of the organization, there is a full set of dma detection, identification, comparison system, the ghoul had left in the police station before With hair follicles and dried saliva, they will get results soon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We caught him!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin Horan turned his head, and the fierce eyes were like the current, so that the idiot who was eager to celebrate the victory was launched. Shaking, "No," he said in a hard state: "It's 'I' caught him." He particularly emphasized the word "I" and pulled out white teeth to everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person in charge of this action rolled up his lips and his eyebrows involuntarily stirred together. He instinctively felt that something was wrong. Their victory came too simple and easy. On the surface, this simple and easy to say can be said to be reasonable - bait, spies or undercover, monitoring, analysis, network... When the organization is serious, want to seize a lifeless foundation It’s not an unimaginable thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is the problem? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghoul’s data picture flashes from his head, his birth, his growth, his resume, he Every case, every victim of his... and then suddenly suddenly stopped in a picture - Dr. Anthony Hopkins was arrested several times, but every time he can escape, one of them He was temporarily detained in an old courthouse, a real cage, surrounded by empty space, a radio and plastic tableware, and a bird of "fine light", but he still found the opportunity to run, the specific process is not allowed But know, but the criminal behaviorist and the forensic team worked together to infer how he did it - he killed two who looked after him, put on one of the uniforms, put on some of his face, and tore it off the other There is also about a pound of meat. Then replace one of the bodies with your own clothes, insert the sheets into the bed to prevent blood dripping, and then smother the body onto the top of the elevator. After tidying up, he lay down on the floor and fired a few shots toward the ceiling (it is said that he called the emergency center before shooting)... The ambulance came, and the guns were everywhere. The staff on the ambulance quickly entered the building and started what they usually do under the gunfire. The trachea was inserted, the bandage was most severely wounded, the blood was stopped, and the person was quickly removed from there. export. They are doing their duty, but the ambulance has never been to the hospital. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened his mouth and wanted to remind the action team members to pay attention, but a knife had been drawn from the side and pulled his throat a big Mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the corpses jumped silently when everyone’s attention was on the elevator, and he straightened his own Legs, slamming my arm and slamming the chin of an action group member, the unlucky guy caught the tongue in the middle of her defense. In the vague screams, she knocked down another person, and the two fell. A pile, completely unable to notice that the knife in the waist of the former had been pulled out by the attacker. The attacker did not hesitate to rush to the nearest person, the captain of the action team. The captain’s throat was cut open, and the blood was removed. A mouth-like wound spurted out and spilled onto his clothes and trousers. He pressed the wound with his left hand. In fact, it didn't work because the wound was too deep and too long. His right hand fumbled for the waist. Press and hold the siren - a sharp voice and a flashing red light suddenly ignited and lit up at all points; the attacker was indifferent, he pierced the knife into the third person's chest, and the knife stuck in the ribs He did not pull out the knife, and Very easy to pick up a hook - the corpse used to hook the corpse bag to lift them up, dragged to drag things, its head is not sharp, but stainless steel, he waved It slammed it into the action group member who was suddenly knocked down by the companion and now wobbled up. The heavy hooks fell into the soft belly, and the victim screamed and bent down, just let the second The beat hit directly on his head, and a noticeable pit appeared immediately on his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current slammed through the room again, but this time it was obviously not enough. Martin snarled and ran over, greeted him from the captain. Dizzy grenades. Huge noises and dazzling flashes overwhelmed the current and current makers, and Martin was thrown into the open elevator by the waves... When he woke up, he found himself bloody, and a medical staff was on his head. Wrapped in a non-adhesive bandage to stop bleeding, his hand was pulled open, fixed, and a bag of plasma dangling under his eyelids. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four weeks should be quite noisy, but he couldn't hear anything. He knew that his eardrums had already been greatly hurt. In any case, few people were fortunate enough to face each other with stun grenades. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin struggled to get up from the arms of the medical staff, his vision was not so clear, but he had already seen the opened door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door of the cage was opened and the prey ran out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18:23. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g District violent mental ward at 6 o'clock on time, dinner, a total of 20 rooms, along the promenade, two guards, a small cart, It takes about 30 minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a stern guard, more cruel and indifferent than any prison or violent ward - as long as you enter here, there is almost no chance to communicate with others. As I said before, there is no wind, TV, letters, mail, or newspapers. There is no contact and conversation between patients (criminals), and it is even more impossible with guards and ordinary medical staff unless they are able to talk or pay with you. The permission of the document, there must be a complete monitoring record, what you said, what was passed, and the details - this means that they will not talk to you about other things outside the scope of the allowable, and this class Opportunities are used to reward patients (criminals) who are more cooperative and obedient. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Human beings are extremely fearful of loneliness, and this fear can even make them forget their bodies and lives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have to work hard to work for them, to set your own sins or to drag others into the water in exchange for a chance to go crazy. Imagine that the patients here (criminals) always try to find opportunities and those who are closest to them, that is, the guards are talking, even if they are swearing, or being beaten... that is also a kind of contact, one Kind of communication. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guards’ afterburning boots made an empty dull sound in the hallway, and the dining car was filled with a dinner that almost never changed, a strengthened paper bowl. Oatmeal, napkin, two slices of wholemeal bread, one egg. No tableware. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His partner is walking next to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a procedure for delivering food, open the electromagnetic door outside, dinner outside the reinforced glass wall, go out, close the electromagnetic door, and then open the inner reinforced glass wall Wait a minute. This is enough time for the people out to take the dinner. After a minute, the internal tempered glass wall is closed. If the patient does not take the dinner, then he has to go hungry for one night if he stays in the strengthened glass wall. The alarm will be called between the electromagnetic door and the electromagnetic door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional stops outside the 18th room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room with the higher number indicates that the patient (criminal) inside is newer, here is the prisoner sent by the action group only a week ago, a sad, weak The continuous poisoner is said to have been caught by an anesthesiologist. This is the fifth prey that the anesthesiologist has lived during this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The electromagnetic door was opened, and the force went in. He and his partner saw the occupants of this cell through the tempered glass that was shown as one-way at this time. Sitting quietly on the edge of the bed, his head is directed at the glass wall, and his eyes are straightforward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, afterburner," his partner yelled. "He seems to be able to see us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't say stupid things," Force said, stooping Put down the oatmeal, the napkin, and then put the bread and eggs on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two retired. Suddenly, the lights in the hallway all lit up, and the sound of the slammed into the eardrum of the two, at the ends of the corridor The electromagnetic door slowly closed - the entire g area was blocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn, what happened?" Afterburner's partner yelled: "Someone escaped?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He put his hand on his holster and turned to his partner, but he was shocked to find that the glass partition wall of this prison was opening, and the electromagnetic door was not closed, "You are crazy," he Cried, and want to grab the controller in the other hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heavily lifted the other hand, he calmly put the barrel on his forehead, and flew him in amazement as he retreated The skull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the glass partition opens to the width of a door, the temporary tenants inside have already come out. If the anesthesiologist is here, it will be confusing. And panic, because the person standing here probably has only one face, and it is reminiscent of William Robertson, a poisoner who was a week ago. As for others, such as accents, eyes, expressions, etc., they have disappeared. There is no trace - or more directly, the person standing here, except for that face, is Anthony Hopkins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, afterburner." Anthony Hopkins calmly walked out of the room for a whole week, when the electromagnetic door closed behind him. The blockade command has replaced the jailer’s authority. This door can no longer be opened: "You have helped me a lot."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't matter, William. You also helped me a lot." Afterburner said that his gun is still in his hand. "Your prescription is very effective. Those guys are no longer noisy. I have slept very well these days. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I feel very comforted to hear this," Anthony Hopkins said with sincerity: "Friends always help each other." His sight Gently sweep the gun in the guard's hand: "So, dear, afterburner, I am going to do my thing, or do you have any place for me to take the handle?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't think so," said the ordinary and honest face of the afterburner, showing a tired smile: "I feel good. What are you going to do, You can take a break here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think," Hopkins said: "You may be willing to help me a little more... I don't think I have anything." Time is for dinner, can you help me eat these things?” He took the eggs and oatmeal in the dining car. “I think you are hungry.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"You are right." Afterburner said that he put the gun on the dining car - Hopkins saw him for a few seconds and found that he had completely plunged into the oatmeal, he backed One step, naturally picked up the pistol that opened the insurance, closed the insurance, inserted it into his pants, then walked to the dead guard, took his pistol together with the holster, and put it on himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He glanced at the afterburner before he left, he was crying, but did not stop the swallowing action, oatmeal and tears swallowed himself together Belly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Hopkins must admit that the institution’s g district is indeed more rigorous, sturdy and harder than all the prisons and violent wards he has been in before. Destroy, but unfortunately, they only pay attention to physical solidity, but they do not know that human heart defense is the most difficult to deal with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
