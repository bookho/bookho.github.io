The visitors showed uncomfortable expressions, but no one complained, a little discomfort In exchange, they only need to stay in this closed and crowded space for twenty seconds. No one wants to talk. Everyone looks up and looks at the roof of the elevator. There are too many people, and they are still in a normal position. It will inevitably rub your lips into the neck or hair of others, and the person with the belly will suck up desperately - the elevator stops, the door opens, and the outside light comes in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to save, the city of Orlosa did not add extra buildings under the observation tower. When the elevator doors opened, the tourists were greeted by the empty wilderness. , bugs, and their tour bus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside the tour bus, there is a dredging car weighing 22 tons, which is two and a half adults high. Visitors take pictures around it, don’t Bu and Sasha passed through them and walked straight back to their car. Two people accompanied them, and there were four others in the other car. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides getting on the bus, he pulled his neckline. "Where are we going?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha reached out and grabbed a small bug that could not be stalked by Besib's ear: "Father Peter told me that there is a very interesting place on the 12th Street."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The car started, and Sasha saw someone running. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am a doctor," a man yelled, and the person in the elevator gave him a position to let him go. This is really not easy, and several people are forced. When the toes were lifted, the elevator's control personnel pulled down the emergency engine and the elevator quickly descended. The doctor turned the girl over with the help of two tourists and asked her to lie on her back. "Have you ever had a history of epilepsy?" the doctor asked. "No," said Mrs. Carson, but the doctor took out a clean handkerchief from his pocket and twisted it into the mouth of Chiz. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I saw her suddenly squatting up," a male tourist said, "like what I saw - quite tempting. So forget There is also a piece of glass - not like fainting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you." The doctor said that he gently picked up Qizi's eyelids and observed her pupil: "Hey, it doesn't look too bad," Mrs. Carson gratefully took over a young girl handing over the ice water. The paper towel, "This water is taken from the hotel's freezer," the girl said. "Like the paper towel, it was not opened, it was very clean." The doctor took the paper towel and wiped his temporary patient clean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elevator is in the end. The tourists rushed out and the male tourist who had previously reported the situation to the doctor helped the doctor to move the Chez Carson out of the elevator. Five minutes later, the ambulance screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chiz woke up before she got on the ambulance and she wanted to go back to the hotel. But her mother insisted on going to the hospital for an examination - the result of the examination, Chiz Carson was only a very slight nasal cartilage contusion, and even the nosebleed stopped at the hospital, the tip of the nose was slightly swollen, but no Hey, then just do some ice, just take a break. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Carson has been with her daughter. When Chiz Carson was completely asleep, she walked out of the room. She and Chiz lived in a suite. There was a small meeting room outside. Kaide Carson was waiting for her outside, his hair was still A little wet, tired on my face. It can be seen that there are two seamstresses in the reception room. They brought Mrs. Carson a whole set of traditional dresses, including corsets, which are most popular among the ladies of the North. Relying on the whale skeleton to prop up the skirt to the surrounding hoop skirt, double-layer petticoat and large skirt, the petticoat is milky white silk, the large skirt is dark green velvet, the button is pearl, they help Mrs. Carson Putting on this dress, Kaide Carson sat in the armchair and waited for everything. He stood up and took out a jewelry box from his trouser pocket with a diamond pin. The pin was a replica of a king. The Queen, the Queen, gave it to her own model of love. The top is a small portrait surrounded by broken diamonds. The diamonds cut into diamonds are hung below, for a total of six. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The small portrait in the man, with white curly hair, dressed in a beautiful and cumbersome embroidered dress in the seventeenth century, his face is only pea-sized. But Mrs. Carson recognized him as Captain Carson at a glance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The father will be furious," said Mrs. Carson. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cade gave her a pin, and her palm pressed on her soft chest: "I dare to swear to my mother's grave, he absolutely can't recognize it, that The poor old man still doesn't love me to the extent of it." He said shamelessly. "How is Chiz?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s just a little hurt," Mrs. Carson said sadly. "She seems to have seen who - when she rushed into the glass of the elevator, her nose was hurt, but I asked her, she refused anything. Say."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is already asleep."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then let her sleep," said Cade. "Do you know the masquerade tonight?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Carson hesitated to touch the diamond pin on his chest: "The hotel has sent an invitation," she said: "but..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I also prepared the one for Chiz," Kade licked his head. The two seamstresses intentionally opened another big box, which was a misty rose dress that was suitable for girls: "I am sorry, He said with a heartless heart: "I will let people take care of Chiz here, only three hours. She is lying in bed, sleeping well, what can I do?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cardson Look at your daughter's room and look at the lover in front of you: "And my daddy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I promise he won't appear tonight," Kade said: "He has a crucial meeting to attend."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took her hand, "I only have five hours, dear "He pleaded: "I took an eleven-hour flight and took an eleven-hour flight back for the five hours."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Sasha and Besib returned to the hotel, Anthony Hopkins was already in their room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is going to look at the diamonds that will be delivered as a payment, because they will soon become stolen, and the quality of the test is only the first twenty-four Hours, Anthony Hopkins has a lot of research on diamonds, and as an extraordinary person with extraordinary vision, he is faster and more accurate than those who need to wear binocular stereo microscopes when checking diamonds for their requirements. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then when they delivered," Besib asked: "Do you need to check it again?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"No," Dr. Hopkins said. "I have all remembered it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The diamond was carefully fixed on the black velvet substrate. On the display board, unlike the display boards that the store chose for the customers, the diamonds on these panels are very closely arranged, and there are one hundred and twenty exquisite loose diamonds on one display panel. Holding it in your hand is like taking a cup of water in the sun, a total of fifty plates, which can be put into a large suitcase - and extra, Constantine asks them to hand over to Sir Raul. Personally, about 100 carats of diamonds are set in a set of jewellery, including headwear, necklaces and earrings. The style is exquisite and chic, and the metal used is platinum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not counted in the two hundred million yuan, the diamonds above are not coded. It is "clean". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hefather Peter doesn’t care, is it bad to do less work? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Hopkins looked at his fingers. When he checked the diamonds, he also secretly checked the silver-white metal brackets and found some very Interesting thing - but this thing, temporarily. All he needs to tell is only Chegal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Sasha entered the door, his father was not easy to smell and sniffed. The "Ghoul" was very sensitive to blood stasis. He saw the West. There were a few red dragonflies in the collar of Brah, and there was a little bit of blood on the edge of the collar, but the smell of blood smelled by him was sweeter, like a young woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great Hopkins clap his son. Sasha walked over and kissed his cheek. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where are you going?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We went to the observation tower by the diamond pit "Sasha said, "Then went to a place where Father Peter told us, just on the 12th Street."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, yes. I remember it. I used to make a pair of emerald and diamond earrings for your mother," Hopkins said happily. "So, I can get an unexpected little gift."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpected little gift is a ring that has no pattern, is simple in shape, and is as wide as a male finger. It is inlaid with a colorless diamond that is about five carats and is cut into a radiant and bright shape. The inside and outside of the ring are polished very smooth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
