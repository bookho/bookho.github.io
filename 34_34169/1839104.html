			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe such associations are wrong, Catherine thought, because since they were out of town, the two lights were as strong as the carnivores chasing prey Behind, and getting closer and closer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It quickly caught up with the black ramp-shaped car, paralleling it on the white concrete road wrapped in olive groves, the lights in the car turned on, the town priest The face came out of the window and gestured to the young man with a stern expression, indicating that he would stop immediately. Catherine clasped Sasha nervously. She glanced at the man in the driver's seat. His face was flushed and his eyes were faint. His nostrils were wide open like a hippopotamus rising out of the water. The gasps almost overwhelmed the engine—he was slightly Slow down, let your car next to the silver winged sti car, and then slammed the steering wheel to the right - the front of the car crashed the other's door and squeezed it out of the shoulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine heard the harsh brakes, the air was filled with unpleasant rubbery smell, the black sloped car was swaying on the right rear view mirror, and the glass was also Almost all of them shattered, but when she looked up from the violent collision and shaking, she saw that the Impreza sti was still a little swaying but still strong, followed closely behind it - it was on the right The body seems to have been suddenly smashed by a beast, but the engine inside, the driver's seat, and the underground tires are intact. The man around Catherine shivered and pressed his hand on the steering wheel. He whispered for a while, and he took out a short-handled, double-barreled, five-shot shotgun with bullets under his seat and extended his window. I did not look at the ground and fired several shots until the bullets were all finished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine turned his head and the Impreza sti moved around in the narrow two lanes, as flexible and agile as the program set in the electronic racing game, with five bullets on it The impact is not as great as the previous man-made car accident. Even the driver who took the black car could not concentrate on driving more than it. It whizzed forward and took a long distance on the road. I hit a corner and stopped. The priest jumped out of his seat and opened his arm like Jesus on the cross. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man’s mouth is raised first, then drooping, his foot is removed from the brakes, put on the throttle, and one step is on, his car is very old However, like all American cars, it is thick and heavy, and it is no problem to crash a Japanese-made small sports car after hitting a person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The car hit the priest straight, making a "squeaky" muffled sound, the black shadow flew over the front window of the car, Catherine blindfolded the eyes of Sasha . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black ramp-shaped car continues to move forward, pushing the silver-winged leopard sti, the man once again increases the speed, the engine sounds more and more noisy, but the power provided The road is not small at all: "Keep it, old man." He whispered: "When you get to the city, you can retire to the car dump."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;And then he heard a "flutter", like someone smashed an egg on top of his head. He looked up and followed the old, discolored interior leather with a silvery white tip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turned a bit, and it stabbed like a lightning bolt, stabbing in the middle of the man’s eyes full of doubtful colors, holding it A hand with black gloves, attached to a small arm, the black vest and the white shirt inside have been cut into strips by sharp metal flanges, but those with strong muscles and smooth skin are exposed. Did not suffer a little damage. Catherine took a soft breath and put a hand behind her, pulling the lock of the door hard; the arm was shrunk back with the weapon, but in ten seconds, the crack on the roof was further enlarged, two The feet stretched out and they kicked the driver to Catherine, letting his master take possession of the driver. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
