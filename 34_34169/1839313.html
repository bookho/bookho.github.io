The instructor euphemistically said: "Although Charlie is not Rand's student, but I have known him for several years. He is a good boy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boo. Douglas took his arm and took a step forward. The moon shines on his face. "I care more than this," he said slowly. "I care that someone deliberately concealed this," he looked at the head: "I, and my team." The players, without knowing it, stayed in a tent with a future pedophile and the gangster, without any precautions, only wearing shorts and vests, sleeping bags next to sleeping bags... If no one debunked him, In the next week, we have to continue to live with him. I use a shower room and use the same knife to eat in a pot. We don’t even know if he has sexually transmitted diseases or AIDS. You think this is fair to us. ?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp; "He is very healthy," said the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who are you? Is it his father?" Douglas said impatiently: "I can understand why he was driven out when he checked the locusts. Well, then you use your rights and force him into my team just because we don’t know anything about him.” He made a scornful expression, “I don’t want to talk to you anymore. What, dear head, Mr., I said, I will complain. I reserve this right, now I have to do one thing," he turned and looked at the players behind him: "Raise your hand."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who wants to see this disgusting guy in his tent?" Douglas said: "People who don't want to raise their hands."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie looked at the boys at the two Grand Schools. They were getting along very well when preparing dinner. They didn't have a Fly Fishing Medal. He saw the fish he had caught. They almost asked him for every detail with a little adoration. One of them also invited him to play at his home. There was also a big river near their home. They can fish there for a whole day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A boy raised his hand without hesitation, and the other, the boy who had sent an invitation to Charlie, only hesitated for less than a second. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is good," said Boa. "Our things are solved, you can roll, gay." He turned to one of his own classes: "You go looking for it, as long as it's what he touched, whether it's clothes or sleeping bags, towels. It's all thrown out, I think he will need it. Remember to wear gloves and spray some disinfectant into the tent."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, yes." Before he walked back to the tent, he said in a disgusting gesture: "Mr. Head. You may be able to ask Sib and Sasha, maybe they will be happy to see Mr. Charlie sleeping next to them, because they are also a pair. In the school dormitory, they often sleep on a bed."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishb heard the words just shrugging. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The students of the Grand School have few words to talk to Grasse, Sasha Hopkins is a girlfriend, the new goddess of Grande . Lila, the black-haired, read books, wrote homework, and quarreled. It was long ago that someone saw Lila sneaking out of the dormitory in Sasha, wrapped in a bed sheet. When they played in Baiyancheng, they also disappeared together for a whole night. Some people heard that Lila was trying to transfer to Grande for Hopkins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for Besib, don’t make a joke, this guy has no girlfriend. But he has countless dating objects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They also know the careful eyes of Boa. Douglas has always hated Sasha Hopkins and his friend Besib. Bisang, because of two consecutive As a swimming team coach, oh, or, Douglas's fancy women are all favored by Hopkins, especially the latter one. She looks at Hopkins' eyes and doesn't know how many boys are heartbroken. Even if they knew that Catherine was the aunt of Sasha Hopkins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie hesitated, his stuff had been sent out by the Douglas squad, not throwing, the boy who invited him, bowed his head and squatted The rolled up sleeping bag walked up to him, and then he ran back to the tent as if he was afraid to catch it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no clothes and towels in the sleeping bag, but it was seen to have been sorted out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Besib said, he turned and looked at his team members. "Do you raise your hand? How do you want to ask someone to raise your hand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "No," said the head. "You have too many people - Charlie and we have a tent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha looks to Charlie, The brown eyes were especially bright in the moonlight, and he quickly lowered his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The instructor and the head of the team urged the children to go back to sleep and told them that the wake-up time for tomorrow was delayed by two hours, and Besib and Sasha returned to the tent. I got into the sleeping bag with their team members. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The players almost fell asleep immediately, but Besib was a little sleepy. He waited for half an hour in the darkness and opened his eyes. Not surprisingly, I saw another pair of silver eyes in the dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They climbed out of their sleeping bags without disturbing anyone, including the players who slept on their way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where are we going?" Sasha asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A cave, I saw it while fishing," Besib said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This cave on the mountain wall is not far from the campsite, there are many small and shallow caves next to it, but it is deep, concave, like a The pot buried in the ground is as big as a room. The river flows over the shoal and drowns it by two-thirds. After the sedimentation, the water becomes clearer and gentler. There are countless little fish inside. When the two boys sneaked in, they rushed in and glared at their bare skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!" Besib shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't wake others," Sasha floated on the water: "Especially Boa. Douglas, he will be squatting at us." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then let your little baby stay away from me." Besib said: "They make me tickle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasha did not answer, just lazily lifted his foot and the little fish gathered toward him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The play by Douglas is really funny and disgusting. He probably doesn't know that he is more like a clown than Charlie himself. In addition, as a versatile person, today's activity is not enough to make them need sleep. Sibu thinks that he should go out and walk, and Sasha thinks so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many such caves on Poseidon Island. They are corroded by sea breeze and sea water. This is probably a river – every place they touch is smooth, and so is the stone that rises out of the water. Besib explores his arm. Moss can only be touched at the top. This cave should be completely occupied by the Grand River in most cases. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it’s really safe here. When the river is not skyrocketing, the big fish can’t swim into this cave, and the small fish staying inside can grow up safely. When the cave can't hold all the small fish, they have grown up to face the sinister world outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can we stay here tomorrow?" Besib asked: "The two guys are playing like a small typhoon in a tent. In the middle of it, I feel that my sleeping bag is shaking."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The head of the team will deduct our points," Sasha said slowly, "and then apply for cancellation." Our camping badge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Sasha said this, Besib only agreed. It’s very interesting to sneak into a strange cave with friends to tease the little fish. It’s a fool to be alone here against the black water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time they came out was very appropriate, but the timing of the return was not correct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people, one big and one small, waded over when they were ready to leave the cave and the little fish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"is the head of the team." Besib said to Sasha with a mouth shape: "And Charlie."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishb dared to swear to the Virgin. He definitely didn't want to deliberately eavesdrop - the place the head chose was too unfortunate, and he stopped at the left front of the cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Grand River rushes, the water regularly hits the pebbles along the river and the bottom of the river, making a low-pitched voice, Besib and Sasha is still able to hear their conversations, but no matter which of the two, speaking, it is intermittent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is that the head of the team is asking Charlie. He thinks that Charlie should not admit it, there is something about it - he is a bit abnormal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie violently refutes, he does not think that he has anything abnormal, and does not think that he needs to hide, if he really wants to hide, he will not I admit in my own blog and publicly show love to a boy in public. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"People don't discriminate against homosexuality." Charlie said: "Your concept is still in the war years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"But they can drive you out of the tent!" the head roared, but he noticed the volume and didn't let it over the Grand River. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not everyone is like this." Charlie said: "I can go to the team of Besib!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't think about it!" the head of the group shouted: "Don't be close to Sasha Hopkins, he is a normal good boy, I don't want to see him being influenced by you!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey." Charlie sarcastically said: "You said that I was not a homosexual an hour ago, but now you are isolating me, just like I got a leprosy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leprosy is not fatal!" The head of the group made a screaming voice: "AIDS is!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Charlie closed his mouth at once, and both Besib and Sasha could hear his clear gasp: "I am very healthy," he pleaded. "You have said that I am healthy, Dad."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bessie squinted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you continue this way," the head said: "It will happen sooner or later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “The AIDS people in drug abusers and heterosexuals are much more than those in homosexuality.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“But you never take drugs...no.” The retired Marines whimpered and said, "Why, Charlie, you have always been a good boy - I don't know at all, why don't you tell me? - Is it not good enough for me? I thought This kind of thing will never be related to my son. Why, why did you become like this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
