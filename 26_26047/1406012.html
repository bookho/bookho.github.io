			<div id="content">This new discovery makes the soldiers feel excited, this is the real use of this armor! No matter what enemy you face, as long as the enemy's attack is not deadly, the strength of the armor can be used to return the enemy's attack. The spiritual excitement makes the recovery of the body faster. Perhaps the original intention of the devil is to let this human taste the taste of desperate death, but if there is no such curse, I am afraid that Wei has died here with Raquel. This vicious curse now saves him like a blessing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes! Wei suddenly remembered the net of the sand spider that had previously tied himself. After waking up, the thing was no longer a hindrance to his actions. On the contrary, Wei forgot its existence, but the reason soon came to mind. It is estimated that there is nothing wrong with it. It should be that the almost deadly thunderbolt burned the spider web and let him get rid of this trap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are quietly around, no one has appeared, and Rakael’s subordinates have not appeared. Can it be said that Rakker put his subordinates before starting the battle? All sent away? No, this should not be possible, and my companions have not appeared. My companions should have fought with those robbers. From the fact that Rakael’s subordinates have not appeared, it is their companion’s victory, but there has never been no companion. Come to him to see, they must have paid a lot of money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We randomly chose a direction to move forward. When passing by Rakail, he picked up the magic sword that almost killed him. This is a lightning bolt. Anyone who uses metal weapons or armor will have a big loss with this sword. Although Wei is not good at using double swords to fight, this weapon should not be buried in the desert like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fine sword shook slightly in his hand, and the sword refused him and refused the new master. Some magical swords will appear to be the master of this strange phenomenon has always been one of the magic research projects, but until now there is no reason to convince everyone to explain what magic weapons rely on to judge and choose the holder . Wei did not pay attention to the resistance of this sword. He gripped the lightning sword tightly. Although the sword wanted to jump out of his hand, he could not escape the powerful hand of Wei. After inserting its scabbard, the sword would no longer be used. I made a sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the night fades, the East begins to show the first morning light, four The companions will finally come together again! Everything is similar to Wei’s guess. In this sudden night battle, except that Lev was not really hurt in the real sense - he was only the blood of others - the other three were turned back in front of the ghost gate. Although Elna seems to have nothing to do, she can see from the smashing of her clothes that she is almost a doctor, she is almost the same, and Behan is even worse. His clothes (the armor has been taken off) are almost The blood that flowed from himself was reddened. Although it was treated by Lev's emergency and Elna's treatment, it still could not cover the paleness of his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leif embraced Wei tightly, now seeing Wei, the rest of the life of the robbery is really alive, although they actually separated only half One night, but what happened in this half of the night is enough to recall a year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go! Go back to the city of DeLand!" The sword was firmly wrapped in the scabbard and then hung around his waist. This magic weapon refused to be used by any of them, but no one was willing to throw it away. Before he finished this job, the others had already completed the preparations before the departure. Although they did not know what would happen in the front, the adventurer’s adventure was not over! They still have a lot to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A huge magical array is portrayed on the ground, in the middle is a no The crystal ball that emits white light stops, and every character that constitutes this magic array is shining, which proves that this magic array has been activated and is in a state of being able to operate at any time. In a house not far from this magical array, Kim and Nobis are together. Today is the last day they get along. Although the Necromancer is not very satisfied with the training results of this student, he has to admit that On the basis of Kim’s past, Kim’s achievements have been great. The magician can make progress in the future, but he does not need to do it in his illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This thing is for you!" The Necromancer took out a cane and handed it to the young man in front of him. This is the first time that he has been trained for so many years. The time he spent with this student reminds him of the glorious days of the past, but the glory has fallen, falling like a sunset, but not Like a rising sun, it rises again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I gave you this magical cane in the name of the Royal Academy of Magic, which marks you have become a noble wizard, accept him, this is proof that you become a great magician! I believe that with you now The power to get this identity is very commensurate!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But...I have not passed any research in the Magic Academy..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I believe that the secular test does not make sense to you. If you care about these names, you have already gone to the magician's exam - you are still at your teacher. I went to study while I was around. But I gave you this magic wand, besides acknowledging your strength, it is a gift that I gave to you! To be honest, I don't know if I have a chance to teach the next young man! Maybe you It’s my last student, maybe...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Nubis teacher!” In the unconscious, Kim has begun to use this title to call the front This necromancer, "The Necromancer is immortal, You can teach more magicians..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes?" The undead wizard’s face showed an indescribable expression. In the hands of Kim, the latter accepted him. "Maybe... Kim, I will give you this magic wand and have a purpose. This magic wand proves that you are my student - that is, you are holy The heir to the orthodox of the Light Dynasty! Perhaps in your eyes, I am only a relationship between the mentor and the mentee, but in my opinion, even this simple relationship can give you this right!" With wide eyes, the words of the Necromancer began to make him a little incomprehensible. The Holy Light Dynasty was destroyed in the dynasty war thousands of years ago. What is the significance of an inherited dynasty heir? But Nubis did not care about Kim’s surprise and continued. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gold, remember the magic book I told you about? This book contains great power, my teacher is here. The book has acquired knowledge that can defeat the higher goblins! The power of the whole magic dynasty comes from this book, and even this book has become the testimony of the dynasty heir! Now, you are the owner of this book for granted! This book is not in my hands, but I know where it is! The spell that unlocks the book's protection I have placed inside the handlebar. When you get it, you can get it on the book. The power! But you have to pay attention to one thing, the powerful force can not be used casually! The real reason for the demise of the Holy Light Dynasty is the loss of mastery of power!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"My teacher, Holy Light, Magic! When you get the power above the book, you know the two sides of that power, it can bring prosperity, it will also bring destruction! This power can't be every one Used by humans in the early years of the dynasty Only those who have been subjected to the most rigorous selection prove that his morality and will can withstand any test. Only such a person can qualify to enter the hall of magic, and a glimpse of the mystery is qualified to master these and can inspire to swallow up their own. The power of yu hope! However, along with the passage of time, with the advent of prosperity, corruption has also occurred. The strict regulations of the past have become empty rules that no one has obeyed. A large number of wills are not firm enough, and people with insufficient morality pass through various kinds. The method became aristocratic wizard, and the knowledge fell into the hands of those who could not control them. Since then, it has been doomed to the demise of the Holy Light dynasty... the lost has been lost, but I hope you remember - - You have to control and master the knowledge and strength, not let them dominate your expectations!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I...do you?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can do it...you must do it...you are not a person with many worldly ambitions, only people like you are suitable for mastering that power!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That..." Kim suddenly remembered one thing. "What about you? Are you not a noble wizard?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" No... In this world, you are the most powerful... The power you can control will definitely exceed me... You are the only existing cursed mage!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where is that book?" Kim asked for a moment of silence. Suddenly something that he never thought of fell on his head. He couldn’t understand the meaning of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the north, the city of Durant in the north! If there is no change, this book is still in the city of Delante, and in the royal treasury! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What! Everything is beyond doubt, and the reason for Kim’s adventure is his last goal! That magic book is the legacy of the unknown mage! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!" Kim woke up from meditation and surprise. He did have too many questions to ask...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician is standing in the middle of the magic array, next to the glowing crystal ball - this crystal ball is obviously the same as the one he saw in the stone tower. Can be used to enhance space movement magic. The Necromancer stood outside the magical array and faced him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I still have one more thing to ask!" When Nubis was about to start this magical array, Kim suddenly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Speak!" The Necromancer shrunk the extended hand back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the old Locke recommending me to you?" Jin asked, he has been afraid to ask this question, but now he is no longer resistant. live. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gold, I have already told you once, there is a 'person' recommended to you, I hope I can give you some guidance on magic. 'People' has something to do with me. His request can't be rejected. This is why I suddenly find you! Others, I can't say more!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold does not speak, Nubis has been trying to avoid this problem, refused to name the recommender, in fact, in the heart of Kim, there is already a ready-made answer, just need to confirm . But if this problem is confirmed, then a new problem will emerge. What is the identity of Old Locke? He has a "some relationship" with this ancient necromancer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go, your friends are waiting for you!" With the words of the Necromancer, the vision of Kim is filled with light, this magical array Was launched, the distance between Delante City and Undead Island is too far away, even the slaves who are zombie mage must use this magic array and this crystal ball to send gold there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light around him dimmed, the magician found himself standing on a small hillside, sight, and only the far road above the winding road Someone and the car are traveling outside. The light of the magical array underfoot has not completely disappeared, but it has been covered by the weeds on the hillside. This is a magical array that doesn't know what era was engraved on the earth. It is probably used by ancient magicians for transportation, but now, besides Nubis, it knows its existence, and uses it, other from this hillside. I am afraid that people who have passed by do not know that the grass under the feet is one of the crystals of ancient wisdom. Time has ruthlessly swallowed everything, this is the sorrow of all life that cannot be eternal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician walked down the hill and walked toward the road. Nubis told him that he would appear near the city of Delante, that road should It is to the city of Delante, just ask to know where to go. When he walked down this hillside, Kim suddenly felt a sorrowful silence, for the wisdom that had been completely buried by the wild grass, and for the magical era that was once brilliant and now completely disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The successor of the Holy Light Dynasty, the name that Nubis gave him was as far away as that era, even if Kim got the magic book, then what's the function? He can't create an era like the Holy Light, or even how much influence it has on the present era. Perhaps the Necromancer wants him to make a great achievement, but Kim’s own final ideal has actually not changed since the beginning—becoming a great magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The so-called big magician is such a magician - able to be in humans Magic is based on the use of Elf magic, human magic originated from the elves of the high spirits, but because of the difference between the two races, the two magics finally become completely different things. When your strength and experience reach a certain level, you will Will go after the source of power, and then; discover - whether conscious or unconscious - really suitable for humans to control the elves, let their limited magic to get the most out of the way!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nubis’s words are still echoing in the ears, his words cut off the magician’s magic in a certain way. The dream, if the words of Nubis are real, then Kim wants to become a great magister, I am afraid I have to wait until the age of his teacher. At this moment, the gold can clearly feel the flying of the surrounding elves, but they cannot grasp their movements and strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician took the road and blocked a large cart that pulled coal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Over there!" The old man looked at the magician's dressed man with a glance, and the whip in his hand pointed to the direction of the car. "If you walk, it will arrive in about two days!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two days?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Almost, if you go faster, you can get it in about a day and a half!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah!" This is the "nearby" that Nobis said, about two days away. Although Kim brought some money, but did not have any travel supplies, this is indeed what he did not expect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So... what time has it been for the recent village?" Kim asked another question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s probably time to see the wall! Hey, are you a magician?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"...Yes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Would you like to join the army to join the army? I tell you, it seems to be a big fight, I don’t know if I will die. How many people, it is best not to go to death, you are still very young! There are still many choices in the future, don't just stare at the soldiers!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Join the army? "War?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't know? There was a big battle in the north of the south. It seems that many people have died. Now they are recruiting everywhere! Those who recruit troops If you see a magician or a mercenary dressed up, you can use it. If you go to the city, you will be pulled if you want to join the army!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The old man rushed to the car and left the magician alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In any case, fly to DeLand City to see, no! It should fly to the city of Delante!" The magician made the decision. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the sky is dark, the magician enters the city for a long time. I don’t know if the old man’s exaggeration is still dark, and the magician did not encounter that situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything seems to be no different from the previous one, Kim thought this when taking a shower in the hotel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Partners’ scheduled routes are long arranged, and if all goes well, they will cross the cursed desert and then reach the DeLand Empire by sea and then arrive City of Delante. In terms of time arrangement, the magician should be a few days later than them, but they may also be delayed because of anything, so Kim did not plan to meet them when they arrived in the city. Therefore, when Kim met Lev on the street the next day, he did not even recognize him from the back of the thief who was bargaining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When gold went up, there were already a lot of people onlookers - this kind of thing is rare, an adventurer is actually selling a magic sword. Everyone knows the value of this weapon, and few people will sell it after they get the magic weapon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Five magical crystal coins, one can't be any more!" The shop owner said loudly, "There is no source, no name, not even sure that you are It’s not stolen, I can only get so much money for this thing!” Fifteen magic crystal coins are actually a lot of money, enough to buy a shop in the city, but for this ancient magic For weapons, it is still cheap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a lightning bolt!" The thief let the gold sound when he spoke, but he couldn’t squeeze in from the crowd outside. "The real treasure, we got it after killing a bandit. Do you think this kind of thing can be stolen casually?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"15 Magic Crystal Coin!” The shop is not willing to give up. “If you don’t want to go to another house, I bet, no one can pay so much cash like us!”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not in a hurry to wait for the money to use, I believe that others will definitely raise more money for this thing!" The thief turned and made the posture to go, his face just right on the outside The gold that squeezed in the circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leif!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gold!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Seventeen magic crystal coins, no more!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" What happened? Where did the sword come from?" The magician asked after the joy of seeing each other again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is nothing, but this sword can be used by no one, so simply sell it! Just like this! You can come, we are waiting for you! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I arrived only last night, when did you arrive, where are you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Today everyone separated, go shopping around! I sold this sword by the way, but I am going to sell twenty magic crystal coins! We arrived three days ago, everyone is waiting for you! Even I haven't been to the palace yet! Rest assured, everyone is very good now, just waiting for you to come and receive the reward... No, it is rewarded!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This sword..." Kim looked at the slender sword in Lev's hand. Without special strength, this sword could not be used in actual combat. It would easily collide with other weapons or armor. It was broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This sword has the power of lightning, other weapons can't be in front of it... forget it, don't say it, since I met it today, Just wandering with me for a day, tell me about it, what have you learned... Haha, forget it, I don’t understand the magic thing, you said it’s useless! Don’t say anything, now it’s easy One day!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black and red flames are burning in the altar It suddenly became stronger several times and seemed to burn outside the flame altar. Every sudden rise of the flames caused the hearts of the people around them to feel tight. Everyone looked at the flames of the different colors burning around the altar with the hope and fear. But The flame finally faded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old magician in a red robe stood up from the altar with a face that could not be concealed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no answer, no god answers your question, and there is no suggestive thing. It seems that what is going to happen is that humans are not allowed to know in advance! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nikkor frowned, but he actually didn't have much disappointment, because from the beginning of the summoning of the gods, he did not have much hope. The last time I sent troops to help the Red League, and the last time Warcraft suddenly appeared on a large scale, did not get any indication from God, this time it seems that there is not much difference. In fact, there are very few opportunities for getting a miracle like this national event. What is very important for human beings may not be worth mentioning for God at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your Majesty, would you like me to announce?" A person next to him came up. The "announcement" he said did not mean to disclose things that did not get the gods. It is said that the gods have foreseen that the war with Reiter will be won. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No..." Nikolay made a gesture, this time even his lords were mistaken for what he meant, and almost everyone took it for granted. I think that the emperor wanted to fight with the Reiter empire, so he asked for the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether it’s a country or an emperor, a full-scale war with another country is definitely not a trivial matter, only those who are born with mental retardation Suddenly, I decided to go to war for something. Otherwise, the war was always brewed for a long time in writing and preparation. It was not put into practice until it was considered fully mature. The so-called sudden incident of war was just an excuse. The two countries, Delant and Reiter, stared at each other as if they were two beasts of meat. The reason why they didn't fight was because they didn't have the same thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go back!" The emperor left the place and walked outside, and the guards followed him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's the new situation?" The emperor sat on the throne and asked The following clerk, although this sentence must be said before starting to deal with the official business, but the tone of his speech can be heard that his mood is now quite irritating. The great defeat on the Mazzaro plains hit Nikolay very much, not only because of the fiasco itself, but also the strange reason that led to this failure. A force that may be the undead suddenly appeared on the battlefield, giving the coalition a fatal blow, and then went to the unknown - this report sounds like a fairy tale, but it is an unavoidable reality. From the analysis of the current situation, Victor may be associated with the Necromancer! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to the information we have sent, Dike has sent a large army to crusade the half-orcs. Now the frontline is unclear, but from the scale of the expeditionary force, Dick has been unable to pose any threat to our northern border, so the reduction of the garrison The plan was successfully implemented..." The clerk's words were suddenly interrupted by a guard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reporting, the winner of the contest last year has returned, and is now waiting outside..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"What?" Nikolay almost stood up, but immediately returned to normal, which is really surprising news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are they outside now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Your Majesty, the Minister of Foreign Affairs is working Meet them!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great, Nikola was stunned by the excitement, although the current temperature is not necessary for heating, "for me Inform the old guy and ask him to come back to see me as soon as possible!" Those adventurers should bring some useful news...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a minute," at that Before the guard went out, Nikolay suddenly stopped him. "Is there any change in the number of adventurers... Is there a few missing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" One less, they seem to be six people, and now there are only five... I remember there is a little girl who is a summoner!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Yes! Very good, go on!" The emperor waved his hand and the guard went out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only one little girl is missing? It seems a bit wrong! It doesn't matter, the old guy who will help me to tell if they are lying...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "You mean, the leader of the Necromancer - what is the name of Wolf, intend to live in peace with mankind?" The old man looked at Lev in front of him, his face clearly saying "I don't believe" four Big characters. A guy like this slut is generally not convinced. In fact, when the old guy sees the adventurers coming back almost intact (although one is missing, but it is a child), he I have made up my mind not to believe them easily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Yes!" Lev replied. Although the adventurers prepared for this question and answer in advance, the whole story was summarized and summarized, and the rectification was rectified... but it still sounded like a fabrication, because the zombie mage involved in this story really makes people Unbelievable - besides seeing his adventurers! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We asked for our rewards, including our original prizes!" Kim said after Lev, the magician at the moment did not have the usual calm because he was anxious I want to get that magic book - this kind of mood is natural for Kim at the moment, but it is seen by the smug foreign minister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So the Necromancers entertained you, let you eat well, sleep well, and then politely send you to the island... yes, definitely There are a few unruly necromancers to chase you, and then you are defeated... Are you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ironic tone in the Foreign Minister’s words is undoubtedly revealed But what he said is actually the same as what actually happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you not believe it?" Leif couldn't stand it anymore. When looking at the face of the foreign minister, he always forced to press a punch. The urge to beat the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes!" The old man made an affirmative answer. In this position for so many years, his reply has always been ambiguous. In his present heart, he believes that the words of the adventurer are half true and false. Those about the Dark Knight, some things about the possession of weapons and armor to the Necromancer should be true, but about the zombie mage, about them. The situation on the island of the undead; it should have been fabricated. These people did not go deep into the Undead Island as they said, and at most they only squatted on the outside of the island, probably watching the temple from a distance or happening to see what rituals were being held by the Necromancer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You..." This straightforward statement, Lev, couldn't speak, and the old man's face showed a triumphant look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you say?" Wei stepped forward, although the adventurers discussed it at the beginning, only let Lev make a decision to avoid any traps, but the old man couldn’t help Wei, in fact Everyone is already angered. If you don't believe in people, you should not give them such unworkable tasks from the beginning. This kind of suspicion is actually an insult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of Foreign Affairs took a step back and looked as if he was scared by Wei’s appearance. He looked at both sides and the guards next to him used the length of their hands. He made a warning posture to prevent the swordsman from making impulsive things. The guards' actions made the old man feel at ease. He straightened his waist again, and Wei was pulled back by Lev. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you provide any evidence for what you just said?" The old man put a smile on himself, and the speed of change made the opposite People can hardly accept it. He regained his original sophisticated and sleek attitude. This attitude and smile are more dangerous than the straightforward way just now. Just like the same snake, it must be huddled before being bitten with fangs, pretending to be a peaceful one. Look like. The situation on the mainland has been completely different from the time when these adventurers set off. At least the Delante is completely different. Because it is expected to have a large-scale war with the Leite Empire, it is necessary to concentrate all the financial resources that can be mobilized. The 3000 magic crystal coins previously promised to the adventurers are a big burden for the current national treasury. A huge amount of money can make a full-size fortress. Such a sum of money can be saved, and Nikola will be able to make his position more stable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Evidence..." This can be considered a difficult problem because There is no evidence at all. They have no physical evidence, and they have no human evidence. Even if they are overthrown, they can’t bring a necromancer to come back and prove it to the old man! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Our evidence is that there is no evidence to deny our words!" Lev's brain turned quickly, and the answer could be said to be impeccable. There is nothing to prove their words, but the same, there is nothing to deny them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of Foreign Affairs’s smile is even stronger. He laughs and makes him feel uncomfortable with him. “I’m sorry, but the evidence is not I don’t see you on Undead Island!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You are on Undead Island? How can you go to Undead Island...”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why can't I go to Undead Island? I just came back from there... Can you prove that I haven't been there? Young people, you should already know, this time The reason why you went to Undead Island, that is, the abnormal event that Warcraft suddenly appeared on a large scale, suddenly stopped after four months, and suddenly disappeared like it appeared. The Warcraft that has appeared has been hunted by hunters everywhere. Basically, I was controlled, so you will take this opportunity to come back and lead..." The Minister of Foreign Affairs said slowly that the expression on his face is still laughing, but the irony in his tone is getting stronger and stronger. I have to do my best to suppress a punch in this old fox. On impulse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Enough! What do you mean by this!" In the front, Lev could barely hold back, but the Behan in the back couldn't help it. The journey of risking his life was thus ruthlessly erased. He already felt that this old thing had no sincerity at all, and he actually killed them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I mean - I hope that you can come up with some evidence, otherwise I can only treat you as a liar..." The following words were interrupted However, because some people can't stand it anyway, although Behan's fist did not have Wei's strength, he still flew out the body of this stinky old man - leaving two big bloody teeth. This punch is really happy, but after a short period of time, everyone will face the reality soon - the guards rushed up, and an ordinary interview became a small encounter. Now, the adventurers can't wait to be arrested. God knows what the old man will come to, and then the action of Behan is actually a common idea. Everyone wants to punch a punch on the old man's face. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician rushed forward, after Wei broke, a group of people began to break out from the outside, most of the guards saw the strength of this group at the contest, not Dare to force too close, so using the tactics of chasing while looking for reinforcements, and the adventurers do not want to open the killing, everyone quit this room, with the fastest speed to retreat to the side door of the palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adult! You have nothing to do!" After almost everyone disappeared from the room, the remaining guards lay on the ground, full of blood. The old man gave it up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The only price paid is only two teeth!" The old man touched his mouth and thought a bit hateful. Although he planned to take a punch, he did not expect the other party to play so heavy, but this is worth it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alarms, almost every place has soldiers rushing out, making people suspect that this is a long-established trap, the adventurers have been completely surrounded There is no gap to drill, the only comfort is that the ordinary soldiers are rushing out, there is no magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What to do!" Lev said aloud that the number of people on the side of the palace gate was the most, and it seemed that it was impossible to get out, and a group of archers began to come here. Come over and enhance the defense of this side, but if you don't move here or look back, you just die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone is coming close!" Kim put his hand on his chest and didn't expect to use it so soon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the depths of the palace, the emperor listened to the report of the recent riots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this all the process?" Nikolay asked the following person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey! It’s awkward old man! This idea came out!" The emperor immediately reached a conclusion, which fully shows how deep his understanding of his capable subordinates is. "But it is no problem! Anyway, the nickname will not be me - the old man is so Many people cursing in the back, should not care more than a few! Hahaha... Go on, right, inform the old man, let him come to see me soon!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where is this?" Lev asked as he gasped, and the scenery around them changed in a blink of an eye, just after Inside the palace, surrounded by heavily guarded guards, but now on a plain hillside in the suburbs, this place thieves have not been there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A wilderness about a day and a half away from the city of DeLand!" The magician replied as he gasped, although the situation was more thrilling, but everyone did not What hurts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why come so far?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No way, when using magic I can only portray it clearly in my mind - Nubis is sending me here!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What should I do next?" After a break, Elna suddenly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What to do... Of course, I have to go back to the city to get our luggage at the hotel first! We have almost all the business there! Hey, we can do nothing for two days now... It’s all blaming gold, sending us to such a faraway place...” Lev tried hard to make a joke and live up to the atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry! It’s all bad for me...if I don’t do it...” Behan spoke, and from the safe place, his face Very gloomy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don’t say this!" The magician patted Behan’s shoulder hard. "In fact, if you don't do it, I will also do it... the old bastard actually said We are liar... It’s so abominable! I really regret not giving him a fireball!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Yes, you are not good!” Behan’s face changed a little better, and Lev followed, “It’s so light! If I, I must smash his chin!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Wei stood up, and he and Elna were the only two people who didn't pant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's go back! Although the city may have issued our wanted order, but things can't be taken back... everyone starts, if we go all night If you can, you can return to the hotel around tomorrow afternoon!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s really calm, what’s the news, there’s no such thing as a wanted order. It seems that a minister’s assault is not a particularly serious crime. The adventurers can easily return to the hotel. There is no search in the hotel. Quite a lot. Although I was going to take things and leave, but I saw the current situation, everyone decided to continue to live here for one day. After catching the night road, it’s an irresistible to eat a meal and then sleep in a comfortable bed. The temptation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That old man is really hateful! Kim thinks that the old man is uncomfortable. If it is not his intentional martyrdom, I am afraid that I am sitting on the bed and studying the magic book now! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No matter what you do, I have to get the book in my hands!" The magician whispered to himself in bed, but what should he do? The palace is so big, the book doesn't know where to put it, it's almost impossible to find it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was sent with a slight percussion, awakening the magician from his meditation, he walked out of bed and opened the door, as expected, outside Lev However, there is still another person who did not think that Behan was actually with him, and the two of them had already dressed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" The magician asked, when it was exported, it was stupid. It is already at night. Due to the mobilization of the war, a curfew is now imposed. If you want to go out and do anything with your toes, you can think of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, to get back our own things!" Lev blinked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get our own things..." To be honest, Kim is I never dreamed of stealing one day, but to say that, the stinky old man took away what they deserved from them in a way that could almost be called fraud, even if they used the method of "stealing". It is too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With the help of magic, it will be a lot easier... at least when you are found to escape and escape!" Lev said with a smile. He will not be embarrassed about the upcoming "night thief" action, because his personal principle is "If you attack with the means of fairness, you will use the means of fairness to fight back. If you use the mean means to attack, use more. Despicable means to fight back." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good..." The magician quickly made the decision, but when he took the door of the room, he found only Lev and Bay outside the door. Han two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Irna and Wei?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They don't have to go...what are you? When I saw that I was going to steal things, I was wearing a white therapist's gown and my body armor? So I didn't call them! What's more, we are not going to fight this time... Let's go, time is tight!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you know where our stuff is?" The magician asked the lowest voice Their companions, who are now outside the walls of the palace, are already in the patrol of the Guards. Although there are no people around, there is always a little better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course know!" Lev replied, "There is a big warehouse in the second half of the palace. No, it should be called a treasure house. Our things must be there!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you know!" Behan also asked questions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Secret! Hey..." Lev smiled. "Don't underestimate the intelligence capabilities of the Adventurers' Union. Don't say so much, go in quickly. Well, Kim, you fly up and look at it, there is no one inside..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the cover of the night, the three figures quietly from a palace The wall flew in. Before the patrolling Guard arrived at the place, it disappeared into the shadow of the pavilion pavilion, causing no attention from anyone, and did not let the defensive alarm magic set in the palace react. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor is on the throne, listening to the old man below with a little leaky The voice is reporting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Just like this?" The Foreign Minister’s words were finally finished, and the emperor just nodded his head and did not have any pleasant expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, sir!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You go ahead!" Nigu Pull did not show any enthusiasm, but simply made a gesture, "Ai Qing encountered this accident, or go back and take a good break!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gula watched the old man go out from the gate, but at the moment his heart was occupied by other things, and he couldn't separate his leisure to handle this matter carefully. The news brought by the adventurer is only two important points for him. One is that the mysterious heavy cavalry is indeed the newly created army of the necromancer, and the second is that the necromancer has no intention to fight with humans. These two contradictions In the mind of the emperor, there is a conclusion that is not conflicting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nikolay shook his head, as if to temporarily exclude the thoughts in his mind. Compared with this matter, he still has a more important thing to deal with today, at least it is more urgent! The emperor only needed to show his eyes with his eyes. The close-fitting guards around him immediately understood his intentions and retired with great interest. Soon, only the emperor was left in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three uninvited guests are slowly advancing faster than they expected Slow, because in this palace, those damn alarm magic and patrol guards are too many, probably because of the eve of the war, these troubles are more than expected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come on!" Lev’s sharp ear felt a slight noise, and he sent an alarm, and the two people behind him slammed to the ground and hid. In the dark of the corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that it is not easy to steal things!" The magician looked at the legs of the guards who had walked by him. Secretly sigh. There was a small but pointed stone in the place where he fell, and his abdomen was sorely painful, but he could not do anything to alleviate this pain. Otherwise, he would be discovered by the guards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there any trap in front?" After the guard's figure was swallowed up by the darkness, Lev asked the magician behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, no magic trap!" The magician replied while licking his abdomen. He grabbed the damn stone with another hand and tried to throw him away. Far away, but after thinking about it, I put the stone down again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lev is like a cat, lightly and quickly skipping the open space in front and entering the next hidden area, after confirming that there is no problem, Bet the two companions too. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How far is it?" The magician at the moment has already turned enough time in the palace, and the turn has completely lost its sense of direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s coming soon!" Lev ambiguously coped with the past, according to the map of memory in his mind, if at the current speed, it should take half an hour. To that, it still means that everything is going well, without accidents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The patrol that just passed just passed, the next team came for a while, this time is enough for three people to turn over a wall and enter a New place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a garden where three people can easily hide in the woods here, in the direction of Lev’s judgment and the surroundings, the magician seeks the magic trap At the time, Behan saw a group of people coming in from an entrance to the garden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three people shrank up at the fastest speed, but the team’s pace was fast, unlike the ordinary guards, the rushing footsteps proved They are in a hurry now, and soon, the footsteps will not be heard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no magic trap here!" The magician whispered, and when the thief was about to leave, Behan licked his two companions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"See the person you just didn't?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Which?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The one among the people who have just passed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What? You know?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will never forget him, the guy who stabbed me at the contest and was defeated by Wei! I remember his name seems to be Called Zuo Edward! How could he appear here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is a mercenary? And he is a captain - now it’s time for war It’s not a strange thing for a mercenary to appear in the palace!” Lev replied, and he listened at the same time to make sure that no one suddenly turned back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, have you noticed that he is following a pregnant woman! It should be his wife, it’s really weird, how to bring a wife. Royal Palace, it is not taken hostage... If that is the case... war is inevitable!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
