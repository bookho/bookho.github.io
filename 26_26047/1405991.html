The Orc jumped from the back of the Griffin and swooped over to humans. There are three or four half-orc warriors on each lion's back. At once, at least a thousand orcs have come to the wall of Hope City. The Griffin took off immediately to transport the next batch of troops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Czech Republic regrets its wrong judgment. The Orc’s siege device is only a suspected weapon, but there is no time to regret it. It is correct to make up for your mistakes. s Choice. He immediately mobilized the troops to counterattack, and they must be wiped out before these half-orcs caused greater damage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a fierce battle on the wall. The human warriors came from all over the place and the two armies launched a fierce battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although these half-orcs are the most brave and powerful fighters, the number of the two sides is too great, they are surrounded by humans, one step at a time. Can't rush out. The bow and arrow kept falling on the head of the half-orc, causing them a lot of casualties. But the half-orcs are also stubbornly resisting, and neither of them has retreated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the step by step of human encirclement, the number of fallen orc warriors is increasing, but at this time, the damn gryphon is transported to the second batch. The troops, these half-orcs immediately plunged into fierce battles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Griffin transports batches of half-orcs to the wall, although humans still occupy an absolute advantage, but the half-orcs finally broke through the human encirclement (Although still surrounded by the whole), occupying a small position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baggra with a warhammer in his hand to resist a human side cut, easy He waved his hammer and smashed his head. This is not the first person to be smashed by his head, but immediately another man rushed over to make up for the vacancy of his competing partner. Bagra is the commander of this assault force and one of the Wanfu leaders of the honorary warriors in the mad beasts (there are 50,000 honored fighters). Yesterday, Gloria gave this glorious task to him and his Troops - they will land on the walls of humanity on the newly trained lion's wall and open the gates of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Isn't you attacking yet?" Bagra screamed loudly, although the Orcs were being besieged by humans, but on the inside, they were also besieging the human towers. In this tower, there is a sling that pulls up the gate. If you don’t capture it, it is impossible to open the gate. At this moment, the human warriors in the tower are using the narrow door for resolute resistance. They also know that the tower must not fall into the hands of the enemy. The narrow door and the passage in front of the door, which are usually quite troublesome, are now the biggest advantage. The half-orcs can only come in one by one and then be cut down to the ground by humans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, in the east, in order to contain humans, the Orcs are using siege equipment to launch attacks, but the Czech Republic has concentrated all the catapults in this area, Under the slamming of the boulder, the siege weapons were all smashed, and the half-orcs hiding behind them fell under the arrow of humanity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bagla looked at the subordinates and was killed one by one. He was anxious, in order to reduce the weight, so that the Griffin can bring as many soldiers as possible, honor soldiers They all took off their heavy armor and only wore the lightest leather armor, but now it is these damn leathers that make the honorary soldiers unable to exert their strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s really overwhelming to capture the tower. With this feeling, Bagra left the front line and he rushed with some of the most elite fighters. In front of the tower, there are already half-orc warriors, but so far, they have not yet captured this tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one squad in the tower, ten human warriors, but with this passage and door that can only allow one person to walk, they resist the attack of the half-orcs, All the half-orcs that rushed in have become the souls of the sword. Bagra looked at the damn narrow passage and sucked in a cold air. This road was designed to be attacked. The extreme is good for defense and not for attack. There is no difference between going in and going to death. Everyone goes in. Will be besieged by ten enemies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But time has not allowed a detailed way of thinking, the human siege is getting fiercer, they also know that the half-orcs want to open the gate, they have to do whatever they want now The price prevents this plan. There is only a strong attack now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six adventurers stand outside this encirclement. Their mission is to block all the orcs who have rushed out of the encirclement. There are dozens of adventurers around them. Although the adventurers are very competitive, they are only good at small group operations and have no use in this large group operation. Therefore, the Czech generals sent them to prevent sporadic orcs from being surrounded and rushing into the city. At their feet, they have fallen over a dozen lucky ones but have unfortunately met their half-orcs.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four unarmed half-orcs rushed into the tower, they grabbed the enemy’s weapons into the body, and they did not let go, when humans tried to get rid of these death squads, Gera rushed in, followed by other half-orcs, who waved the hammer to break a human being who was trying to pull the spear out of the enemy's dead hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The death of the death squad was not in vain, the Orcs finally destroyed the humans in the tower, and the four strong orcs immediately rushed to the turntable that controlled the slings of the city gate. Turn this thing that humans swear to defend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main force of the Orcs outside the city finally saw that the gates of mankind were slowly rising, and they gave an earth-shattering cheer, and Geller waved. The Orcs ignored the arrow rain that fell on the wall, and rushed toward the gate like the tide. The brave of them rushed ahead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Czech general knew that the big event was not good. He quickly mobilized all the mobile units and tried to stop the Orcs at the gate. At the same time, if humans further narrow the encirclement, they must recapture the tower as soon as possible. Otherwise, everything will be finished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the wall, humans have an absolute advantage, but at the gate of the city, they have not been able to stop the frenzy of the half-orcs, and the Orcs finally rushed into the city. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the gate of the city, under the wall, in the streets and houses close to the gates, humans and half-orcs are fiercely fighting everywhere, but the half-orcs are walking The comrades of the comrades and the enemy continue to move forward, and the passionate and bloodthirsty passion engulfs more and more soldiers into the vortex of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more and more half-orcs rushing into the city. They began to support companions who were besieged on the wall. The half-beasts on the wall increased greatly. Also started counterattack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adventurers became obstacles to the Orcs. They stopped the Orcs from supporting them in a small team. They were very acquainted companions, and those half-orcs were Their flexible tactics have been hit hard. But as more orcs were born, they were also washed away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are six people occupying a very favorable terrain on the wall, they resist the onslaught of the Orcs taking turns, at least thirty and half orcs are killed in their Under weapons and magic, but even so, the half-orcs continue to increase. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not Beibei, then Hope City is about to be framed like this. Babe has exhausted all her power and summoned the best she can find. Strong Warcraft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A huge ice snake appears outside the gates of Hope City. This Warcraft is obviously the same family that Babe summoned at the contest. It may be that the grandmother of the ice snake is also uncertain - this ice snake is 20 meters long, and the thinnest part of the body is thicker than the water tank! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coldness brought by the ice snake immediately caused ice to be formed near the gate, and the Orc looked at this terrible Warcraft with fearful eyes. Babe issued an attack order, and when he heard the master's order, the ice snake immediately rushed to the siege. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ice snake wanders freely among the half-orcs, which freezes them into groups with freezing air, and nails them to the ground one by one with ice cones. Use your teeth to bite the body they wrapped in the armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orc attack was stopped, the ice snake completely controlled the gates of the city, and no half-orc could rush into the city. Seeing this unexpected turn, the morale of human beings was greatly enhanced, and they immediately launched a counterattack. After all, they occupied an absolute advantage in quantity compared to the half-orcs who had already entered the city. After the soldiers drove off the Orcs, the archers returned to the wall, and they used the sharp arrows to shoot the half-orcs blocked by the ice snakes under the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the front is a terrible World of Warcraft, the soldiers of the Wild Bet Corps are still rushing forward, and they use their swords to attack this low-dimensional creature, because of madness. The orphan corps has the same cruel discipline as iron. Unless the king of the tooth orders the retreat, all the warriors who dare to retreat will be treated as deserters. This is also the reason why the mad corps was completely annihilated. After the death of the king of teeth, they only Can continue to attack, until all deaths). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the city, Bagra and his troops were once again surrounded by human beings. This Warcraft caused a panic of the Orcs and greatly encouraged the morale of human beings. They resumed the offensive. They must now completely eliminate these entanglements. The half-orc of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the fierce battle, Bagra suddenly discovered the culprit of summoning Warcraft, a little girl, the abominable human being manipulating the ice snake! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The killer must be killed. Bagra, with his most devout subordinates, tried to kill the human encirclement, and several half-orcs together The adventurers in the city rushed over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there are only three of them, and the other has six, but Bagra has the confidence to eliminate these humans. He waved the hammer and slammed into a man dressed in full body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 02<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei’s long sword broke open the other side’s heavy one Hit, destroy the magic sword to cut the carotid artery of the tall half-orc, blood with life together from Bagra's body, he fell with a look of disbelief, he finally saw It is one of his subordinates who was turned into a fire group with human magic (Gold knows that the honorary warrior is very resistant to magic, he uses powerful fire magic). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, at the gate of Hope City, the ice snake is tired of this game, and now it uses the most labor-saving method to eliminate those rushing flies - first Use frozen gas to freeze them into ice cubes, then sweep them with your tail and break the ice cubes. In front of this terrible World of Warcraft, countless heroic warriors have been turned into pieces of ice on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greg is watching all this, the battle is now very unfavorable to the Orcs, and now the troops that have rushed into the city are in a difficult battle, but the main force is given by the ice snake. Blocked (the griffin is already very tired, can no longer go to the battlefield). This situation can not continue, and Geller pulled out the hammer of the god of war hanging in his waist. The beast that crosses the feeling of the master's will, gives a roar (the beast is a very precious mount, this fierce carnivore looks like a lion and tiger, it has strong limbs, and can be on any terrain Flying for a long time. The beast's body is very soft, which allows the rider to sit in any situation, but the most powerful beast has the ability to move instantly over short distances. Only the aristocrats of the half-orcs are qualified to ride the beasts, and then rush to the ice snakes in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ice snake noticed the mighty Orc Knight, but it did not care to spit out a cold, and wanted to freeze this half-orc into ice like the others. Piece. But when the freezing gas arrived, the knight and his mount disappeared in an instant, and the frozen air spewed out. Göll moved in an instant to attack the ice snake. He waved the hammer of the god of war and hammered it on the ice snake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a few cracks in the body of the ice snake, and the powerful power of the hammer of the god of war directly hurt its body, and it gave a painful sound that no one could hear it. The howl, swept over the damn half-orc with its huge tail, but Göl disappeared before the huge tail hit him, and its tail just turned a few frozen orcs into Pieces only. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greek appears behind the ice snake, and the beast and its owner have a tacit understanding, it leaps and leaps to the head of the ice snake, When the ice snake had not reacted, Geller forced the hammer of the god of war to give a fatal blow to this creature from the low dimension. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hammer of the god of war is striking on the head of the ice snake, and the powerful power of the hammer of the god of war reveals that the head of the ice snake has been smashed halfway. When the beast falls to the ground, everyone can see that the huge body of the ice snake is collapsing and becomes an ordinary ice without vitality. At this time, the Guards of Göller rushed to their masters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The King of the Tooth defeated the terrible ice snake heroically, and the Orcs all gave unparalleled courage, and they rejoined the city in a cheer The door rushed and the situation of the battle changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The six adventurers on the wall looked at this scene, everyone was white, and did not expect the king of teeth to go out in person, not to think of the ice snake Will be defeated. However, only Wei is still not moving, for him, it is a great opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We picked up two bows from the ground and then grabbed one from the human archer who was running through the panic. He began to look for the right weapon. Wei's gaze fell on the spear in the hands of a war dead soldier. He ran over and picked up the spear. He folded the spear into two pieces with one hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the keen intuition of the warrior, Geller felt that the danger was approaching on the side. He turned and his eyes met with Wei's gaze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were loosen the bowstring, and the spear swooped toward the chest of the screaming screaming, and the spear tip flashed cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The forces gathered on the three bowstrings all converge on top of the spear, faster than the reaction of Geller, and the guards of Geller watched Their leader was shot but unable to do anything. The half-orcs who were rushing to the gates of the city saw the king of the teeth shot by the humans (spears) and they stopped the attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gerler stood up from the ground, because there was no stable flying tail feather on the spear, so although Wei pointed to the chest of Geller, he was a little bit awkward. Only shot his right shoulder socket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greek is full of fury, his eyes are filled with pain and anger, he grabs the spear on his shoulders and bites his teeth directly When it came out, the blood immediately spurted out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give it to me," Geller screamed to the stunned men. "What are you doing here? Go in and kill those humans!" He grabbed the Hammer of the Gods with his left hand and led the Guards to the first to rush to the gate (killing the red eye, even the beasts have forgotten to ride!)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The half-orc, who was awake, rushed up with the king of the tooth, and gathered into a torrent of steel, breaking through all the resistance of mankind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the wall, the adventurers are caught in the encirclement, and six people are being The half-orc was besieged, and the half-orcs who killed the red eyes launched a wave of onslaughts. In this area, they are the only human beings. Others are not killed or killed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We used a long sword to open a half-orc slam, waved left boxing on his face, and flew the half-orc, and the sword Without being idle, I cut the throat of a guy who sneaked into Behan. In order to protect the magician behind and the babe who has exhausted the power, the four people form a circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Must break through," Lev screamed as he screamed at the Orc's assault. "Sorcerer, think about it, or we will all be finished." "!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know," Kim replied loudly, "Keep it up again!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Gold completed the spell of the blasting ball with the fastest speed. A blasting ball hit the middle of the orcs, causing a lot of smoke, gravel and dust while causing casualties. The adventurers took advantage of this opportunity to stand out. Surrounded, rushed down the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We must separate!" Lev said as he ran. "Otherwise we can't escape!" Behind the adventurers, the half-orcs are tight. Chasing after. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone knows that this is a fact. They just don’t know how many orcs have been killed. Those half-orcs have killed their eyes and will never let them go. . Elna grabbed the slowest babe, and the six men split into several roads and flew in different directions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weione ran to the left, he was very prominent in the battle, and for the Orcs, nothing is better than the first level of the Warriors. Prove that you are a warrior, and most of them are following closely with Wei. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behan, Lev, Elna and Babe keep the original route unchanged, although knowing that everyone may not be able to escape, but these two The man is still following Elna, not willing to escape separately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold is running to the left by a person, very unexpected, but the half-orc who usually hates the magician does not pay too much attention to him, and Kim only chases after him. Four or five half-orcs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We passed a corner, although he was wearing a heavy body, but he still ran very fast, half-orc will not catch up with him for a while. But now he found that he could not escape, and unconsciously, he entered a dead end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We turned around and the Orcs had already caught up. They found that this human being had no way to escape, and they slowly approached with a sneer. Wei put his body on the wall - so that he can not be attacked by the back - raise the weapon in his hand and prepare for this hard battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sword light flashed, and the Orc launched a storm on this warrior. Wei used a sword to support it. From time to time, a half-orc fell, but cut one, and immediately added a pair. It must be admitted that Wei’s Wu Yong is truly amazing. One person resisted the attack of hundreds of half-orcs, but he has no hope of breaking through now. The sword could not be blocked, and Wei Meng released a strong vindictiveness. He suddenly shredded the seven or eight orcs who besieged him, but the half-orcs did not cringe, and the other half-orcs immediately rushed up and continued to attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is over, Lev calmly shot a knife on the belly of an unlucky half-orc - this guy only pays attention to protecting his throat - he already After using all the hidden weapons, the only weapon in his hand is the short sword that is not used very well. Similarly, Behan also used up the energy on the sword of the earth, and now they can't attack from a distance. The Orcs will soon be able to catch up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What to do, there are several ways to escape in Lev’s mind, as long as he drops his partner to attract the enemy, he will be able to run away, then he can Secretly fleeing the city that was captured through the dark passage. As long as he is willing, this is not a problem, but can he leave his partner to escape? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The front Elna has stopped, they have now fled into a dead corner, the more than twenty orcs that are behind are approaching, except to destroy the enemy, They have no choice but to do anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now is the time for my final decision. The Orc hasn’t come yet, and quickly fled with his own skills as a thief’s flying scorpion, screaming at his friends. It is the right choice to attract half-orcs' time to escape, but why is it so stupid, even holding a short sword to meet those terrible half-orcs. Lev felt that he was quite sad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 03<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei already felt very tired, and he has been lying down for dozens of feet A half-orc, now he is breathing rapidly, just after he issued the last vindictive, he won a chance to breathe for more than ten seconds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orc looks at this human being in front of him, he has killed not knowing how many of his compatriots, but still unharmed, his body seems to be useful The strength of the end is really a terrible human being. This kind of Wu Yong is even incredible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone!" A half-orc yelled, "As long as you can kill this human being, you can be a great warrior who everyone admires. You must not let This opportunity slips away!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-beasts swarmed again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am going to die here? This is probably my place of burial. But it’s still good, this is the “glorious war dead” that I have been pursuing. After seeing that his home was destroyed, he always wanted to die, but as a soldier, even if he died, he would die vigorously and die. In the first few years, I spent the whole day in the battle with the rats. Although I explained this as trying to improve my strength, in fact, I only want to die gloriously in the battle. Only. The sin in oneself is too heavy. It is because of his own fault that the destruction of his homeland has led to the death of all his loved ones. This is all his own fault, and he cannot even forgive himself! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Wei Zheng used the sword to hold the half-orcs again and again, but in fact only the flesh is fighting, his heart has fallen into frenzied thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many rats have you killed in the past few years? Kill at least one hundred every day, and every time you find a cave of a rat, you will rush in, and then come out with blood. For three years, his figure of armor became a nightmare for the rat. Whenever his shadow appeared, the rat would soon escape with the fastest speed, but he could always catch up with the rats and change them. Become a dead body. Finally, in order to obtain a glorious death, he left his hometown and came to the mainland. Although he said to himself that this is to increase strength, he actually Know that he is absolutely impossible to defeat the Eight Eyes Devil. As long as it is human, it is absolutely impossible to defeat the Eight-Eyed Devil. However, now it is different, he got the sword of extinction. As long as he knows how to use this weapon of high leprechaun, defeating the Eight-Eyed Devil is no longer a self-deception. Before defeating the Eight-Eyed Devil, you must not die! ! Never die! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thought of the eight-eyed demon, the unforgettable pain will return to his mind, he still remembers the last time he saw the eight-eyed demon, that The hateful demon is chewing on a person's leg. It is the leg of his 13-year-old little sister. His little sister has been eaten by the Eight-Eyed Devil, leaving only one leg to taste. After seeing him, the Eight-Eyed Devil sent a huge smirk, disappeared into the air before he rushed, leaving only the village that was completely destroyed, the headless bodies of a bunch of relatives, and the one. Half of the leg, and his sister's head - mixed in all the heads, piled up at the entrance to the village. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-orcs stepped back, and they were all watching the human beings who released such a horrible murderousness. The human eye in front of him had become dark red. He was not a human being, but a horrible beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leif rushed forward, staring at the half-orc just got Behan The weapon was opened, and there was no chance to recover it. The short sword was pierced into the chest of the other side and went straight to the heart. The half-orc even became a body without a slam. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the other half-orc rushed over again, his long-handed sword slammed into Lev. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leif pulled out the short sword, he stepped back, but the heel suddenly encountered something, a sly, and sat down on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am really an unqualified thief! Even the most basic rules of thieves have not been observed, how can thieves fight hard with the soldiers? When you see that the situation is not good, you should smear your feet! But I am so stupid, this is going to die here. It’s a pity that I’m still young, I’m not a monopoly, I’m going to die, and I’m not sure what’s going on. The most important way to die is because there is too much money. As a result, the amount of money is exhausted. Unfortunately, this hope has no chance to be realized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-orc rushed to Lev with a triumphant expression, and Lev’s eyes were not even about to be killed, at the moment, Han and Elna are being entangled in other enemies, and it is impossible to save him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing that Lev is going to die under the sword of the Orc, suddenly, a sand falls on the face of the Orc, and the eyes of the Orcs are captivated by the sand. He began to blink his eyes in a hurry. Of course Lev would not miss this opportunity. He jumped up and a sword pierced the gap in the armor and sent the half-orc who was still blinking to the West. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leif is turning back, his savior is Babe, this little girl is really unexpected brave, although it has exhausted power (essentially The power of the summoner is almost limitless, because as long as Warcraft is willing to listen to the call of the summoner, he can continue to summon Warcraft. However, the power of the Warcraft summoned will interfere with the body of the summoner, so that he can not and other The more World of Warcraft communication, the more powerful it is to summon the powerful Warcraft, or the longer the summoning of Warcraft, the stronger the interference will be. As far as Beibei’s state is concerned, because the power of the ice snake is too strong, the time of existence is also very For a long time, completely interfered with the communication between Beibei and other World of Warcraft. She can't even call the smallest World of Warcraft. She must wait until the interference disappears to summon the next Warcraft. The Summoner will also be subject to many restrictions, for example, it is impossible to summon in the water. Fire property of Warcraft, etc. Sometimes, nature will also give the summoner interference, so that they can not summon Warcraft in a certain place. These restrictions have led to the summons Decline.), But she dared to aid him with sand, you know, if she did not spread in the eyes of the Orcs, Orc certain that she would head to the plucked alive. Lev made a reassuring gesture to the little girl, and the little girl smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is not much time to celebrate them, and another half-orc turns his attention to Lev. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heavy battle axe greeted Lev, and Lev was too late to dodge. He used a short sword in his hand. The huge force made Lev fly out, and he suddenly hit the wall, and the short sword in his hand broke into two paragraphs. If it wasn’t for Babe to scatter sand on the face of the Orcs, then Lev was really dead this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this time the sand didn’t hit the target, the Orc’s eyes were not fascinated, he turned and looked at this odious little devil, no longer paying attention to that one Unmoving thieves. Babe was scared back and forth under the gaze of the Orcs, but the Orcs caught up with her in two steps. He grabbed the little girl. Babe struggled hard, and she bit in the hand of the half-orc. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this is quite heavy, but the Orcs did not let go, but the grasp is even tighter, he wants to give this nasty little guy to death. While he was about to smash the babe to the ground, the baby got out of Babe’s pocket, and it hurled on the face of the half-orc, using his sharp teeth and claws to fiercely leave ten on the face of the orcs. A few blood marks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-orc screamed, he dropped the babe, and pulled the fierce little animal off his face, the baby’s body still Without his big palm, he grabbed the monster in his hand and forced his hand to make the baby into a meat sauce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The baby is squeezed by the huge force, its eyes are squeezed out, the whole mouth is squeezed open to the maximum, this pain Let this poor little animal not even sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-orc fell down, the baby was released from the bondage, and it immediately jumped into the arms of "mother." But in the eyes of Babe, there was a look that made it scary. The little guy made a scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behan is now being besieged by six or seven enemies. His swordsmanship is good, but now it’s dangerous, not far away, a dozen orcs. Right around Elna, the two are now just supporting each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 04<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great, Behan is being besieged by five weapons, these half-orcs Not only is the strength, but the cooperation with each other is quite good, five can make the Beckham can not afford. Behan has only the power of parry and has no power to fight back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I regret it, if I practiced the sword more seriously, Behan tried to wrestle and thought that when I left home, I thought I was very capable. It’s enough to go out and sway. Now I want to come, probably because of my luck, I have never met a strong opponent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jianguang flashed on the cheek, if it wasn’t hiding, the head was split in half, but the blow had already left on his face. A wound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I left home, I told my father face to face, he was going out to find a woman who deserves a lifetime of love. I didn't think that I had inherited the pedigree of my father. After I met Elna, I didn't know how to pursue a few women. Most of the reason is that my talent is very good. The appearance of the wind and the sweet words are easy. Pick up the woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A half-orc screamed and slashed, but Behan blocked the powerful blow with the sword of the earth in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I finally embarked on the path of the swordsman, too dependent on the power of the magic sword, once you can not use the power of the sword of the earth, your true strength is really Not very smart. Although I used to think that I would never be like other swordsmen, but in the end I can't resist the temptation to use the magic of the sword. As long as the power of the sword is used, the enemy can easily be defeated. In countless times of victory. Even I have forgotten that this is just the power to borrow the sword rather than my own ability. Although he was defeated at the contest, he still hasn’t taught himself enough lessons. It’s too late to comprehend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leif wakes up from a coma, just forcing a sword is too reluctant, he shakes his still dizzy head and opens his eyes Just happened to see Babe rushing to the half-orcs who besieged Behan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Return, dangerous!" Lev wants to yell, but his throat is sweet, and a blood vomits out. It seems that the impact on the wall just made him The damage was greater than he had imagined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bebe squeezed hard, the baby in her hands spit out a thin flame under strong pressure, hit a half-orc, that little The flame can charcoal the upper part of the tall half-orc, and the half-orc fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leif simply doesn't believe in his own eyes. This little monster can spurt fire. This is nothing strange. He has long thought that this magical creature should have something to do. He is strangely the flame, or something that looks like a flame. The half-orc did not burn. The flame did not ignite anything on him and burned him. In fact, although the half-orc was burnt, his lower half was not burned, and the flame burned him. After the coke is extinguished, it is definitely not a flame. It is an energy that looks like a flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The baby’s body was pressed again. In pain, it spit out a flame again, and sent a half-orc to the West. The baby became the flamethrower in the hands of Babe, and as long as the babe was forced, the poor little animal would spit out a deadly flame (magic pistol???). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-beasts are escaping, but behind them, the avatar of the Pluto It is catching up. Whenever the Orcs take a step, there will be several half-orcs being separated. This terrible speed and strength is enough to make anyone shudder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terror is shrouded in the hearts of every half-orc, the terrible murder that makes them feel the horror of death, they are running away, just as the tigers are chasing The rabbit definitely can't think of resisting. Just now, they witnessed the horror of this devil. After the human eye became dark red, after he exudes such terrible murderousness, he is no longer a human being. It is definitely not a human being, not even a human being. Is any kind of creature. After his change, only the soldiers of the mad beasts who were among them could continue to attack, but immediately they were cut together with their weapons and armor, after taste of the blood. The monster became even more crazy, and every action of his became the call of Pluto. After being killed more than fifty, the morale of the remaining half-orcs finally collapsed. They turned and began to escape from the monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei chased after him, and the long sword divided another half of the orcs who ran in the last. When the sword was withdrawn, he cut a section of the two sections and cut the sword into three pieces. . He is completely intoxicated by the thrill of blood, which is really a pleasure! Whenever I see blood spurting out, that kind of comfort is really indescribable. When the blood splashes on my body, the whole body is boiling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei’s tiger mouth cracked because he couldn’t bear the power of his enemies with weapons and armor, but what does it matter? Although he saw the huge wound in his hand, the wound only brought him happiness rather than pain. He wanted to make the crack bigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, who am I?" There was a strange problem in the mind, of course, this did not prevent him from opening the bow, putting two The head of the Orc was cut down. "Who am I?" This question once again appeared in my mind, this time a lot clearer. "Yeah! Who am I?" he said to himself, while a sword stabbed two very close orcs and placed them in the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who am I?" Now I am sober in my mind, which makes his hands and feet more flexible, and he catches up with five and a half at once. Orc, "Right, I am Wei!" At the conclusion of this conclusion, he has already caught up with two unlucky guys. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think of it, everything is up! I was besieged by a group of guys. It’s strange, now how am I chasing others? Wei used a sword to wipe a guy's neck. It was a masterpiece. It just cut off the blood vessels without hurting the throat and the trachea. He glanced at the wound with a smug mood, but now it is not a time to slowly appreciate his masterpiece. There are a lot of raw materials waiting for him to develop! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This dead end is full of half-orc bodies, most of which are very incomplete, with very few corpses of luck, can run out of the alley The half-orc is really rare compared to the grand prize. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei finally recovered, he recovered from the state of ignorance just now, now he no longer fights like a beast, but starts to use some advanced Tips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s weird, fighting for so long, I’m not tired at all! It is clear that the vindictiveness has been exhausted, but now it can be arbitrarily issued. The tiger's mouth cracked a big hole, but there was no pain at all. Now there is a kind of yu hope that I can't restrain, that is, I want to see more blood, I want blood to splash on myself, but this yu seems to be unsatisfied, no matter how many orcs I kill, I can't satisfy it. More, more blood, the fascinating red liquid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold is walking on the wall, it is easy to get rid of those half orcs Just flew over a wall with flying magic and took the guys off. After a moment of no purpose, he returned to the wall. The battle in the city wall has ended, and the human defense has been forced into the city. Now there are only bodies and weapons in the pool of blood on the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold looked out of the city, the half-orc only left the rhinoceros heavy armored assault cavalry in the wilderness outside the city, Geller was very wise, he did not let this is not good The soldiers of the street fighting entered the city, and they stayed outside, waiting for the humans who might break out. If humans can rush out of the city, then this wilderness will become their graveyard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden looked back into the city, the city is burning, but this is not the fire of the half-orcs, but the last line of defense prepared by humans. After the defeat of the city gate, the Czech generals withdrew his troops here, and ignited the house that had previously piled up the burning, blocking the enemy's pursuit. But after all, this line of defense is temporarily arranged, and a quarter of the cities are not in its protection. In other words, what does it matter? The flame will always go out! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main force of the Orcs is led by the King of the Tooth in front of the fire wall, and the human beings are also separated by the wall of fire. Almost all human beings are hiding in the wall of fire. There is almost no one in the outer quarter of the city. Only a group of half-orcs are arbitrarily plundering. (The other five adventurers are in this quarter of the city). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greg is in front of his army, the wound on his right shoulder has been bandaged, but the wound still has a sharp pain. These severe pains only made him more angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gerler’s left hand still clutches the hammer of the god of war, this weapon does not know how many people’s blood and brains have been contaminated, and the whole becomes “red plus White". Centered on the Wild Bet Corps, the Orcs formed a tight queue behind him, and as soon as the fire went out, they immediately attacked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Geller looked at the opposite wall of fire. He knew that the victory was already in his hand. Now it is just a game of cat catching mice. The mouse struggles again and can't escape the end of death. His eyes suddenly swept to a group of half-orcs, and they were about to leave the queue and take a good plunder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s really bad!" Geller looked at it and turned back immediately. "When you go back, you must reorganize your military discipline! Even if it’s not a mad beast. Can't be like this!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;第05节<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold looking at it all, he suddenly felt himself It’s too small, and in this battle, the power of one person is nothing at all! "Right! How are the partners now?" Just as he wanted to find his friends, a voice came from behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, it’s useless! Even the reinforcements have not been waiting to be broken, and the whites have ruined my careful arrangement! Also say what Dico first General! However, the half-orc kid is really amazing! It’s the first king of teeth in a thousand years.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold turned around behind him It’s the old Locke that speaks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Baby pistol" is really powerful, under the cover of the firepower of the pistol, Behan Actually killed all the half-orcs, and the two immediately went to support Elna. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fire shot (poor baby), killing a half-orc at once, Behan immediately rushed up, Elna saw the reinforcements, and the spirit The half-orc who besieged her only scored a few to deal with the two men and one beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Lev has also stood up. He pulled the short knife from the waist of a half-orc, although he did not use it. But it can be done. He found his own knife on several bodies and rushed from the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The baby pistol is extremely powerful, as long as the half-orc being sprayed by the flame will never be okay, just suffering a poor little animal, it is pinched by Beibei. Enough. After a hard fight, everyone finally annihilated the dozen or so half of the orcs. The victorious humans, regardless of the pain and fatigue of the body, escaped into an unobtrusive house at the fastest speed. It was not long before they entered. Another team of half-orcs came to the scene of the tore. They started searching immediately, but did not find anyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This must be a magician!" A half-orc saw the charred body and came to the conclusion that "the magician must have gone!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now catching up with the last half of the orcs, but he is not too slow Speed ​​catching up, he wants to use this unlucky guy to find more Orcs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current Wei’s thinking is very clear, and he knows that he is now fulfilling the teacher’s desire to control the power of the mad warrior. This is the first time he can successfully succeed in possessing the power of the Berserker when he is clear-headed. Although he does not know why, but now he can maintain the power of the Berserker, it is enough. He himself knows that the power of the Berserker is not eternal, as he knows, the longest-lived Berserker is two days. Wei knows that it is very dangerous to keep the state of the Berserker, but he does not know how to return to normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now his body is full of tremendous power that cannot be vented. In contrast, his mind is filled with bloodthirsty yo. But if the state of the Berserker is now lifted, then he is afraid that even the strength to stay still is gone. He is now endlessly overdrafting his vitality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another figure around the corner. Now the half-orc has no use for bait. Wei Yijian divides his body into two points, and the cutting surface is very Even if there is no water mill, there is no such effect. Then he stepped up a few steps, he had to cross the corner and catch up with the prey in front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly crossed the corner, and there were a few orcs in front of him. He just rushed when the Orcs had not found it, and it was easy to level. The last two unlucky ones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One, two, three, four... The joy in the heart is getting stronger with the killing, it doesn’t matter, just cut it, anyway, just stay The next one will do, maybe one will not leave...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Demon Sword stopped before it hit the target. Under the sword, it was not a half-orc, but a human being. The half-orc was just chasing him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold looked back at Old Locke, the old man’s appearance and dressing almost nothing Change, but Kim feels that he has something different. It is not the serious tone of his speech. Anyone can change his tone. He does have something different from the past. Maybe he is not different. He just used to hide it. It’s gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You...you..." Kim was surprised because his tongue was knotted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh!" Old Locke ignored the surprise of Kim. He walked over the side of Kim and looked into the city. "It seems that it will not work! It’s really crazy." The Corps Corps! Even this sturdy city can be quickly attacked. As long as the flame is extinguished, the city is completely finished."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Locke," Kim Unconsciously, he spoke to the old Locke in a respectful tone, and no longer called him "the father". "How did you get here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It’s a spectacular fireworks!” Old Locke didn’t seem to hear gold at all. “I don’t know how many years have seen such a spectacular fireworks.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although they showed me such a nice fireworks, the city is too important to give them! But it doesn't matter. The general is impossible, you must think of a way!" Old Locke still ignores gold, only one person talks to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, young!" Old Locke suddenly turned and said to Kim, "Do you want to be a hero!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the gold answer, the old Locke pulled Kim into a relatively empty place and said to him, "Young people, do you have confidence in your will?" But Kim still has not answered Old Locke went on to say, "I know that you must have confidence. Young people like you are very confident in yourself! Now, the fate of this city will be handed over to you!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ignoring the reaction of Kim, Old Locke forced this responsibility to his head. It is really the same as his usual style. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elna treated Lev and Behan for a while, although physical fitness Strong, but now Elna is already very tired. Behan didn't suffer much, but Lev's injury was a little troublesome. However, Elna still tried her best. When she treated Lev, Behan was at the door, and Babe was comforting the poor baby. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are now in a very ordinary house, the owner of the house has obviously escaped long ago, the house is empty, everyone is sitting on the floor. There are a lot of houses in this area, and the half-orcs will not come here for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The baby is in the arms of Babe, the battle just made it suffer a lot, the bones on it are almost crushed, babe Clearly seeing the baby's eyes are tears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, baby, don't cry," Babe gently stroked the little animal in his arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The footsteps came, as if someone came in, everyone’s heart was immediately tightened, everyone was ready to fight – Babe immediately put the baby He is still in his hand - but the footsteps sound like a person, not a class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the man opened the door, Behan fiercely pulled the door open, the person at the door lost balance, and one fell into the house, the sword of the earth was already On his neck. But Behan immediately took the sword up. It was a human being. In particular, it was a middle-aged man with a little weight. He was scared to death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You...you..." The uncle couldn’t tell the words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Small voice," Elna stepped forward. "There are half orcs around here! It was found to be dead! You are the house." Master? Don't worry, we are not bad people, we just hide here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
