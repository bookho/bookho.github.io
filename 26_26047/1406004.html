			<div id="content">The ball of light was extinguished, but a flame rose in the dark, and the adventurers knew that they could not walk out of the woods this evening, and they began camping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seven people are sitting around the fire, and the feeling of the outing on the island has long since disappeared. Everyone is silent. . But losing direction is the unfortunate start for them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a rustling sound in the woods, as if something was coming close, everyone heard the sound, everyone jumped up and everyone took it Weapons, ready to fight, but nothing happened! The rustling is still going on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It won’t be the sound of the wind!" But this is impossible, because with the light of the campfire, everyone can clearly see that there is no wind blowing. The leaves, in fact, have no branches at all. It is indeed something, or some kind of power is approaching them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened?" Lev asked, everyone is forming a circle to prevent the enemy from launching a sudden attack, but the enemy - it should be the enemy - Has not appeared. Everyone is concentrating on observing the surroundings, beware of whether they will jump out of a necromancer or a sergeant, but ignore the rustling itself. No one has noticed that there is a humming and magical singing in the rustling sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no eye to see anything, but Wei’s heart suddenly understands that the enemy has come to the side. This is not an enemy in the ordinary sense. Unfortunately, although there is no way to know it. Detailed grasp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s bad! The enemy must have come behind me! Everyone suddenly had this thought in their hearts. Everyone couldn’t help but turn their heads and look back. Of course, nothing was seen! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I doubt that slowly accumulate from everyone’s heart, slowly gather, they begin to feel that the partners around are planning to leave, leaving themselves to attract the enemy Attention. Because everyone is now in a circle, and the most vulnerable to the back of the attack to the companion, so the idea is more and more like. Everyone keeps looking behind them to make sure that the partners behind them have not left themselves to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the red nose, the other six people have experienced such a long history after all, although the suspicion is getting deeper and deeper, but they will not defeat them. Trust, but Czech is different, he and these young people know less than two days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They want to abandon me together! Although there is no basis for this idea, it has become more and more certain in the hearts of tavern owners! They lied to me to let me attract the attention of the necromancer so that they can escape safely! No, they simply sold me to the Necromancer to exchange their lives! Their conspiracy is now known to me, they are going to kill me! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The circle finally collapsed, the red nose got out of the other people, put his back on a tree, and he was loose when the body touched the trunk. Take a sigh of relief. Now his face is facing the other six people, preventing them from rushing over to themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The footsteps made other people who were already very sensitive turned their faces, they saw the red nose boss standing back against a big tree, and Panting in the big mouth, the sword and shield in the red nose hand point to the target themselves! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright whispered the mantra while observing Crystal ball! Seven people are carefully separated, and everyone is leaning against a tree. The adventurers have formed a new circle, but this is an inner circle! No one has noticed the humming of the woods, and everyone’s vigilant eyes are their own companions! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call! call! call! Brett bent down and gasped. Although not reconciled, but Brett had to suspend his magic, this magic is too much load for the lack of practice, and one of the seven real forces is not enough! Although this special crystal ball has the power to project power directly to the display location, it does not have the ability to zoom in! This high-level mental attack power generated by the power of the god of darkness is powerful, but the consumption is proportional to the power! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I’m lucky!” Brett once again sat down, just because he couldn’t hold it and didn’t see the guys killing each other. It's a pity! But it doesn't matter, my time is still very much! Although the island seems calm and calm, but in reality it is full of traps, just take the wood where they are located. This forest will not allow other things besides the undead to go out! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attacking seven at the same time is too reluctant, but if you only use one, you should have no problem! Because it is actually the last play of the cat before killing the mouse, Brett selected the weakest one among them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What am I doing?" Everyone’s brain is suddenly When they woke up, they found out that they are not the enemy, but the companions! If Brett insists on the time for a little more, at this moment these seven people have begun to tear each other. The suspicion and hostility that had just gathered in the heart disappeared in an instant. They still keep their original position unchanged because they haven’t returned to the idea of ​​where they came from. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician dissipated the energy gathered in his hands, confused to see his own hands, he never dreamed that he would plan to use magic to attack his partner. In the end, the idea of ​​how it was produced is not. This is not the result. It is something that is forcibly stuffed into your heart! In an instant, the memory that the dragon gave him was floating on his mind. All the questions were answered. There is a spirit of spiritual attack in this forest, and it is a very powerful force! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone is careful! There are enemies hiding in this neighborhood. It is he who makes us hostile to each other. If you don't find him quickly, we are all dangerous! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone has put away their weapons, but they haven’t yet understood the magician, everyone is watching gold! "It was a spiritual attack. Some people sent hostility into our minds. Let us kill each other. Although we don't know why it stopped, but this attack is so strong, the enemy should be nearby! Let's hurry up and search. "Everyone is scattered, search for the nearby woods, but only Babe stands still! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong! Beibei?" The magician walked over to the little girl. "Is it scared to you? It's okay, just pay more attention, in the spirit." With the preparation, we will not be the same as before!" The magician put his hand on the back of the little girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's let go!" This low voice is not like coming out of a little girl's throat. The magician was shocked by this sudden change, and the whole person was stunned! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said let go of your hand! I hate the magician!" Babe looked up at the gold, but the innocent eyes are now full of killing meaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hate the magician! The magician is as annoying as my dad, always doing something weird, killing my mother, always taking me Keep out of the room and let me go out to play. All the magicians are the same bad, you are the same!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician has not come and made Reaction, there was a fire in the air, and a small group of flames quickly became bigger, and in a second, it became a giant bird of flame in time! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge red lotus bird appears beside the magician. Kim can clearly feel that the flame elves in the air are highly excited and surround this flame. The birds that make up! No, this flame bird itself is the existence of an elf, it is only a few times more powerful than the ordinary elf, and even allows you to maintain a visible physical existence! This flamingo is obviously controlled by Babe, because although the body is a flame, but the magician and babe who are almost close to it do not feel hot, it is restraining itself, if it releases the heat of the body, then these two Individuals must be made into fly ash immediately! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Firebird looked at the gold in front of it with its flames, and the magician connected back a few steps under its gaze. The companions who are searching around have discovered this change at the moment, and everyone is watching the sudden appearance of the flame giant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bebe issued an attack order because the owner is around, so this flamingo can't fully release the body's energy (if it does, no matter what gold How much has to be done right away), it just opened his mouth! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What spells are too late, but the magician who was shocked by this great elf actually forgot to read the spell. This moment is actually only human instinct. In action, the magician slammed into the room and escaped. The deadly fire column ejected from the bird's mouth hit the ground where the magician was. The ultra-high temperature immediately hardened the ground and became a piece of ceramic. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not Warcraft! How can a summoner summon this powerful elf? It is simply second only to the existence of Vulcan Ivlit! After the door of perception is opened by the elders of the dragon, Kim can clearly understand the existence and activities of the elves! In the panic, the magician suddenly thought that Babe must not be an ordinary summoner, maybe not a summoner at all! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician tried hard to stand up and escape, but his reaction obviously could not keep up with the speed of the Firebird attack. The golden eye looked at the deadly fire column and spewed out but there was no way to escape! For a moment, it seems that the whole world has stopped. There is only the ruined pillar of fire in the eyes of the magician. His body has no way to move, and he can only wait for his own destruction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A figure flew over and smashed the magician’s body out, but exposed his body to the firebird’s attack, and the fire column fired at him. When I came over, I couldn’t hide it, but there was an energy on the ground that was sprayed with earth and stone. It was able to block the attack. After passing through the energy of this road, the power of the flame was greatly weakened. Although the hair was burned a little, the body had a few bubbles, but it was safe and sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright appeared on the magic crystal ball in front of him A crack in the road, he rushed to stop his magic, but it was too late, the crystal ball was full of cracks. In order to convey the power, the crystal ball is connected to the displayed space at a certain level. The appearance of the firebird fills the space with the power of the fire elf. This crystal ball has no way to bear it and finally leads to collapse. Although Brett stopped the magic, but the power of the firebird still exists, so the cloth can only watch the crack on the crystal ball getting bigger and bigger, and slowly darken, the image inside slowly disappears. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s over! It’s terrible!” Brett finally understood what was going on, but everything was too late, and the precious magic crystal ball is now The cracked crystal fragments became waste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not my fault! It's not my fault! I don't want to, all of them are not good!" Brett stayed in the chair, his face Pale, speaking in a mechanical tone, but there is no one else except him. He knows that this crystal ball is important to the Necromancers. In fact, this crystal ball is the core of the entire defense system of the Undead Island. With this crystal ball, all the magic traps can be started at any time to meet the invaders. At the thought of the undead wizards seeing the reaction of this precious crystal ball being destroyed, Brett felt the whole body weak, and the cold came in from every pore. Like all humans, Brett has deep fears about the Necromancer. Although he is very calm on the surface, it is not so much his courage as it is the courtesy of the Necromancer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What to do, black robe may come back at any time, if he sees this pile of crystal fragments, it is not a strange thing to kill himself immediately! Although with the help of His Holiness, he not only lifted Raymond’s bondage, but also greatly improved his strength. However, Breit’s deep knowledge of his ability is no way to compete with the black robe as a zombie mage. of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get a chance to slip away, anyway, that gold can't live! But as soon as he thought of the consequences of doing so, Brett immediately dismissed the idea. Brette's trip to Undead Island was actually to monitor the Necromancer, because the Sayādaw realized that the Necromancer had some actions that were not planned, and, by the way, allowed him to use the collection of the Necromancer to enhance his power. Brett knew that the power of the Sayādaw was far stronger than the Necromancer, and that it was more cruel than the Necromancer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bulai has no choice at all. Only if the effort is to be explained to the black robe, he keeps praying to the gods in his heart and will not see the crystal. The pieces will start! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this wait filled with anxiety and fear, Bruce repeated the curse of the golden source of the evil, time and again, if it was damn He will not encounter such a thing since the enemy in the destiny that has been formed in the School of Magic! When I think that I might be made into a grievance tower, the curse of Brett is more vicious than once! Without the guy who is like a bull, his life must be relaxed and comfortable, instead of waiting for the judgment of the Necromancer in this ghost place! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's the matter?" High speed with the inexplicable hatred of my heart Faded, Babe suddenly felt full of sorrow "What did I do? How could I have this idea?" Although the magic acting on him has disappeared, the change of thought caused by this magic remains in effect. Babe was temporarily lost in confusion and did not know what he was going to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Firebird is very dissatisfied with the fact that the attack was blocked by the power of the Sword of the Earth, and that Leif dared to save it under its flames. The target of the attack is even more angry. Although it wants to give the thief a little lesson, its owner just asked it to attack the magician, so it decided to temporarily let the guy in front of him and attack the owner in another way. The specified target. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as Lev's remembrance had not yet begun, the flamingo began to vibrate his huge flame wings, and the elves of the flames that existed in this space obeyed the orders of the elves who were higher than them. The magician has not come and sighed in the life of the nine dead, and the robe on his body began to burn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not an ordinary flame, that is, it is not the kind of flame that starts to ignite from a small Mars, and then slowly rises, but is covered at the beginning. The whole body is full of deadly fire. However, after all, this attack has a certain distance from the last attack, enough for a person wearing armor to rush. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to do?" Perhaps it was influenced by the curse of the demon king. Although in such a tense situation, Wei’s brain was still sharp and clear. Although the attack summoner is the best way to defeat Warcraft, but now this firebird is summoned by Babe! It is obvious that the little girl is being manipulated by the enemy, just as she was manipulated by the enemy not long ago. It seems that there is no other choice than to compete directly with the Firebird. However, in the process of rushing to the firebird, his eyes saw the fierce flames of the magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, at this time, everyone has recovered from the sudden surprise of Firebird, and they have already begun to act. Behan is the earliest awake one (this is also brought by his mercenary life). If it is not for him to use the power of the sword of the earth to help the gold in time, no, it is to help Leif block it, then the thief is probably only left. The next pile is gray. The red nose boss is already summoning his Warcraft, but because of the overwhelming power of the space fire elf, it is more difficult to contact Warcraft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elna is the farthest away, but she is back at the fastest speed, her goal is Beibei, her choice is very Correct, because she is the only one (except the magician and babe) - although killing the summoner can solve the Warcraft, but the effect is the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We spurt his vindictiveness at a suitable distance, a distance that neither hurts the magician nor allows vindictiveness to reach the goal, only hurts in gold When there is no injury (every fire has to go through a short period of time to injure people), the elves are quickly expelled by the energy of life, and the flames are of course turned into nothing. However, in order to release his vindictiveness (otherwise, the magician will be killed by his vindictiveness), Wei was forced to stop, he did not have the opportunity to rush to the side of the firebird. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new attack of the Earth Sword has come at this time, and the ground where the Firebird stands suddenly rushes from below to a force, and the energy violently impacts the Firebird. The body of the flame, the body of the firebird gave a burst of shaking, as if the wind was blowing the campfire. But it is clear that this attack did not cause any harm to the flame bird. Before Wei Lai's and continued to rush, the Firebird fanned its wings and flew into the sky. The constant harassment of these guys made it annoying. It decided to eliminate these inconvenient guys before completing the master's mission. In the sky, the scope of the firebird's attack has greatly increased, and the firebird opened his mouth again. This time the target is the thief who just got up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leif has stood up, just fortunate that he is not dead, now the pain that has been uploaded by the body has been gone without a trace, although Behan The correct blow saved his life, but the taste of the remaining flames was not good. But it hurts, and after seeing the flame bird aim at himself, he moves to the side with his fastest speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A figure wearing a lilac robes appears outside the woods - This color robes were only allowed to be worn by the highest-ranking aristocratic sorcerers in the era of the Holy Light dynasty—although he walked the way to be no different from ordinary humans, but from the layers of his bare hands Black can be identified as a necromancer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come on?" He clearly heard the sound coming from the woods. After becoming a necromancer, his original ear lost its effect, but The Necromancers do not need the senses of their bodies, they use a different way that humans cannot know to perceive everything around them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because of the covenant built by the long-term existence of this place, I will dissipate the power of the scorpion in the name of the summoner! The power from the Hades regains its roots in the underworld. The crowd of the nest! Seal! Retreat!” The Necromancer completed his spell. For a moment, there seemed to be a wind blowing through the woods, and the leaves of all the trees were rustling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The following is your own! The selected person! If you can't even deal with Wolf, then you are not worthy of his recommendation." "The sorcerer of the purple robe turned and left in his own words." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Experienced thieves use the S-type route that is difficult to attack, so that Firebird has no way to aim. On one side, Behan, holding the sword of the earth with both hands, looked at Lev nervously and was ready to support. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bebe is looking confused at everything that happened around him until one hand grabbed her shoulder. This sudden change made her a big jump. Babe turned his head and saw Elna's face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong? Elna's sister?" All the confusion suddenly swept away, and the last magic of Brett's body on Babe was also carried. Not willing to disappear, the little girl returned to normal. Although Elna had intended to stun the babe, there was nothing unusual in the eyes of Babe when he turned his head. So Elna stopped the attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's okay! Babe? Are you back to normal?" Elna grabbed Babe's shoulder and the little girl nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, your World of Warcraft, call it to stop!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firebird also In the fast-moving Lev, it is going to hit a hit, but this human action is too agile to capture the trajectory of his actions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ice Magic, Ice Magic!" The magician knows how he does it, but the more nervous the person is, the more he can't think of something, the original magic of the back. At this time, the spell did not know where to fly. Fortunately, this situation did not last long. After a little calmer, the spell returned to his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Abominable!" Wei looked at the flamingo above his head, but there was no means to attack this Warcraft, originally intended to rush to the side of the firebird and then use Fighting against this Warcraft, but because of the need to save the gold, he lost the opportunity to approach the Firebird. Just when he was helpless, he suddenly remembered the battle in the cave of the elders of the dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s very clear to remember that the Eight-Eyed Devil’s words at that time were “great! You can use your own power to control the entire space rule! Repel all elves, only the gathering itself. Life energy attack is effective!" Life energy refers to vindictiveness. At that time, the demon king should compete with the dragon and the dragon elders, and it is a directional launching vindictive. Is vindictiveness a jet that can be directed? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We issued a grudge, but did not release this Pentium energy directly Out of the body, but forcing it into the body, and trying to gather them together. The body is as painful as it is directly attacked by vindictiveness, but Wei Si does not care about the signal of the flesh, but works harder to compress this energy into his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firebird finally found an opportunity to attack when Lev’s body had to pass through two very close trees. But just as it opened its mouth and did not spit out its pillar of fire, two attacks arrived. Kim's "freezing ball" (a more powerful ice magic, bursting out to release the frozen air after contact with the target. The power is very impressive) accurately hit the flame bird in the air, the white frozen gas surrounds the whole firebird, But this attack only prevents the firebird from firing the flame column, and does not cause any harm to the flame bird itself. What is really effective is a sturdy energy sprayed from below. Under the impact of this life energy, the body of the firebird is like a residual candle in the wind, and will be blown away at any time. In addition to the core, the flames of the attached nature were all blown away from the body of the firebird. Although the Firebird still survived this attack, its body seems to be twice as small. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flamingo in extreme anger finally recognized the source of the attack. It gave up the original goal and must resolve the threat first. But the master who summoned it issued an order to let it go back. Although it was not reconciled, it could not violate the command of the master who summoned it. The firebird hatred disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge disturbance in the air has disappeared, and the red-nosed boss’s Warcraft has only come late, a snow-covered sleigh from the ground. I came out, but in fact everything is over now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright went out of the room, he now thinks clearly, instead Waiting until the black robe comes back is not as active as looking for him. This will give you more opportunities to explain. But less than ten seconds after he walked in the hallway, a ghost mage appeared beside him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wolf is asking you to see him!" The voice directly passed from the black mist wrapped in a black robe to the mind of Brett. The ghost mage has lost his body, so he can only use mental stimulation to each other. contact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, he found out!" But the idea was immediately overthrown. If the black robe really found the crystal ball destroyed, he would not be troubled. There is a ghost mage to call him - he will kill him directly, or he will "handle" him in another way, a way that is chilling and embarrassing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where is he?" Brett replied, his voice trembled a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In his own meeting room!" The Ghost Master responded with a mental induction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Know it!" Brett continues to move forward. Since it is in the reception room, this should be an ordinary kind invitation. But he didn't notice that after he left, the ghost mage walked in—specifically, drifting in—the room he was in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adventurers carefully searched all places nearby to prevent This kind of thing happened, the magician added mental protection to everyone, but they found nothing. At this time, the East has already revealed the white belly, telling the adventurers that the night has passed and the dawn is coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I haven't found it? Where will I hide?" Kim carefully thought, in this ghost place that can't get out, there is still a hidden attack at any time. The enemy is too dangerous. But since it can't be found around, it means that the enemy has escaped (or it is too good to hide). I can only hope that I can get out of this ghost forest today. It is not so easy to go out of the woods and want to attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go!" Lev patted the magician's back, although he didn't sleep last night, but the impact on these adventurers is not too great. Kim replied, carrying his own luggage and keeping up with the team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician looked back and looked at the front, and his heart was strange. . They just walked less than twenty minutes, but they have already walked out of the woods. Did they say that they have already reached the edge of the woods yesterday, just a little more? But he obviously remembers that the place where he camped yesterday was not at all on the edge of the woods. "Probably the error of the environment!" This is possible. After all, here is the Undead Island. It is normal to have something different. Anyway, they have already stepped out of the woods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The front is a plain, nothing grows on it, because all the land above it is black, there is no way to grow the scorched earth of the plant. This shows that this land is already under the cover of the power of Pluto. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the team was resting and having breakfast. After leaving the woods, everyone was relieved, and when they got nervous, they got tired. Everyone decided to sit down and take a break and have breakfast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red nose boss went to the magician's side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gold, you listen to me, there is a strange thing!" The red nose said softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The little girl named Babe has no secrets!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"密符???"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are a magician, you should know a little, The summoner uses the secret character, just like the magician uses the prayer. But the little girl did not use the secret character at all, her World of Warcraft seems to be summoned out of thin air? This is incredible!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold in the depths of his mind, recalling a little bit of knowledge about the summoner he learned in the School of Magic, vaguely remembered the term crypto - these are not related to magic If no one mentions it, Kim simply can't think of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The possibility of her summoning is not Warcraft at all!" But the magician did not let this sentence be said, except for him, others could not recognize the elves and Warcraft. The difference. But what does it matter? Babe is one of their companions. So the magician used the phrase "I know!" to deal with the red nose. But in his heart, his curiosity about Babe's life experience has been further strengthened. What kind of person is Babe's father? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brett is marching alone in this long corridor. He is perhaps the only human being in this ghost place, except those who will die. This Pluto's temple can't be seen at all. It was built and managed by a group of undead wizards, because this place is very clean and beautiful, and it is very disproportionate to the word "undead." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ceiling on the corridor is full of wonderful carvings. If you move this corridor into a palace, the rest of the palace will be lost together. These fine things can't be imagined by the undead. However, as the Supreme said to Brett, "What are you afraid of? Is the undead wizard not human?" After all, the necromancers were once a human being, and it is not too strange to have such artistic sense. thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright’s goal is the end of the corridor, the private reception room of the black robe’s necromancer, this long corridor runs through the whole of Pluto. The temple, there are countless empty rooms on both sides. More than a hundred years ago, there was a necromancer in every room, but now, after the end of the undead war, most of the owners of the rooms have disappeared from the world. It is. These rooms have become commemorative companions, reminding the Necromancers not to forget the shame of defeat. If you open any door, you can find some precious magic items in it, but Brett does not want to offend the necromancer for this reason, especially the black robe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright’s pace is quite slow, because he walks in the stomach and carefully considers his own arrangements to explain whether there are any loopholes, so in him It was a long time since I walked through the corridor and came to the front of the black robe. Although I know that this is a black robe room, in fact, this is the first time that Brett came to this place. After all, he came to this undead island for only two days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright reached for the door, but before his fingers touched the door, the door was automatically opened, as if the door itself I can recognize that there are no guests coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room is very simple, too disproportionate to the gorgeous corridor outside, only a few simple chairs and a table, the window is opened, The sun shines in, but this is actually an illusion. Because this room is not a place where you can shine in the sun, in fact, this is just the light of magic, but the intensity of this light can be mistaken into the sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black robe is standing in front of the table facing the door, as if playing with something, although he should hear the sound of the door, but he Did not change his current position, did not care about the Brett standing outside the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Wolf!" Brett especially strengthened the word "Mr." in his own words. He knew that before saying bad news. Must be polite. But the black robe still hasn't turned around, and the scene looks a bit unusual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Wolf!" Brett repeated it again, but the black robes of the Necromancer kept their posture unchanged, and he seemed to be unaware of it. The arrival of Brett. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright has a bit of a sigh of relief. He feels that this attitude of the black robe is too much, so he is bluntly stepping into the room. Mr. Fu, what do you ask me to come over?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There was nothing wrong with it, but now there is something, and it is a very serious matter!" The voice of the black robe was like coming out of the ice hell. He turned his body, and Brett clearly saw what he was playing when he turned around. That is the magic crystal ball that was destroyed by Blett's mistake! No matter from which point of view, Brett could not see a little friendly intention from Wolf. He quickly retreated in panic, and the result was mixed by the threshold. The whole person fell to the ground, but this Can't stop the Necromancer from approaching him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Wolf, listen to my explanation..." Brett said quickly, but in fact, the black robe gave him the opportunity to explain this time, he also has Panic and nothing can be said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No explanation, I think, this explanation is enough!" Wolf held his hand, the center of the hand is a piece of crystal ball. He threw away the pieces that had no use, and a black gas was generated on the palm of his hand. In a short time, it became a solid, dark sphere filled with solids. This dangerous magic is enough. You can kill Brette ten times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I beg you to spare me, look at the face of the sage!" Brett knew the horror of this magic, he did not expect Wolf to use this Magic to deal with him, for a moment, he even forgot the fact that he can resist a little, his desperate hands and feet and back, although this action can not save him. But now it’s completely in a state of fear, but it helps him, because if he tries to resist, then Wolf will kill him without hesitation, but now he’s like a wolf, but he’s delayed. One point, let him have a chance to speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The group has been on this black land for quite a long time, and there have been no suspicious things, although almost every one of them has heard that the island is full of cockroaches and corpses. It seems that There is still a gap between the legend and the truth. They have to go on this dark land for a whole day before they can see their destination, the Temple of Pluto. Although the name is called the Temple of Pluto, the temple is also dedicated to the six gods of death, the goddess of blood, the god of trials, the god of food, the god of naturalization, the god of decay, all in this temple, of course, this temple is also Protected by their power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question that everyone is discussing now is what to do there, as Leif said, if they intend to completely eliminate the Necromancer and the Undead, it is no different. When the idiots talked about their dreams, they came here just as a reconnaissance operation, figuring out whether the appearance of Warcraft has anything to do with the Necromancer. But the task that the damn old man gave to them was "to destroy the plan of the necromancer as much as possible", and the sentence itself has much room for manoeuvre. Lev advocated retreating in the temple for a little reconnaissance, so that the magical crystal coins were right against each other. There were two people with a sense of justice in the team, and Lev’s proposal was not passed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are not worried about encountering enemies now. As we all know, the number of necromancers is not a lot now. They can’t come so far from the temple. Patrol, if it is a team of soldiers, then only two World of Warcraft is enough to deal with them, and even if they can not beat, they also escaped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold is now at the end, that is, walking behind Babe, he did not participate in the previous discussion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Babe!" The little girl turned around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where is your family living?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Which home, my family moved a lot "The little girl looked at the magician with a sly look. When the adults asked him where he lived, it was because he planned to send him home, but she still doesn't want to go home because she still Ask Dad to wait a little longer, who told him not to care about himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's your last one..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the little girl interrupted him," I won't tell you!" Then I will continue to walk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your father is a magician, right?" Kim still didn't give up, because he really wanted to know what kind of person Babe's father was. I can actually teach such a daughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes! Like you, but you like to wear a gray robe, he always wears a black robe. He says he is a dark magician and should wear black. Robe. But this is his dressing out. He is very casual at home. But this is all the time when my mother is still alive..." Kim noticed that the little girl’s eyes were a little red, obviously remembered mom. But she is an optimistic child, and at the most active age, so these unhappiness quickly disappeared from her mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dark magician? ? Kim is grinding the words of Babe. There is no such thing as darkness and light among the magicians, but there are dark magic and bright magic in the magic. In fact, human magic is divided into two categories, one is the elemental system of physical and energy attacks. According to the attribute, it is divided into water-fired ground fire and its derived thunder-salt light, etc. The most advanced one is space magic (manipulating space to attack Or the magic of defense is extremely difficult), and the other is spiritual magic, which is divided into light (defense and auxiliary) and dark (manipulation and mental attack). However, spiritual magic has always been ignored by the magician (at least it is now ignored by the magician), because this type of magic has a natural weakness. First of all, the goal must be a smart creature, or even a human being. Of course, spiritual magic will not play any role in the quality of Warcraft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, in elemental magic, there is not much difference between attacking one and ten targets. Playing an enemy with a blasting ball and playing ten enemies consume no difference. However, if it is dark magic, the consumption of ten people is ten times higher than that of dealing with one person, and the effect is worse. Finally, and for the most important reason, the rise of the sword has also affected the magician. The magician is now more inclined to defeat the opponent with the elemental magic of the Mingdao Minggun instead of sneaking the dark magic. Since Babe’s father claims to be a dark magician, he must be very proficient in dark magic, and there are only two kinds of people who are proficient in dark magic. One is a magician who is addicted to magic research, and the other is a magic assassin. The terrible guy of dark magic, if your loyal bodyguard suddenly pierces the sword into your chest, it is probably their masterpiece!) When I think of the magic assassin, Kim suddenly thinks of the mysterious guy who ambushed them in the woods. I don't know if that guy will come back again...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wolf stopped his action, and Butlet did not make much sense to touch him. "Look at the face of the Sayādaw!" Although this guy is very hateful, it has destroyed the important treasures of the Necromancer. But the words of the Sayādaw made his anger begin to calm down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Supreme... This mysterious guy is the great benefactor of the Necromancers, he gave them so much help, the value of this help can exceed this crystal The ball, and, for himself...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wolf’s high-speed condensed black ball dissipates at the same high speed, he has dispelled the idea of ​​killing this nasty guy. After all, he was sent by the Sayādaw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give me the roll!" The necromancer turned his face, and the lucky guy who had killed a life quickly stood up and ran out, fearing that the black robe had The possibility of change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Abominable!" After leaving the room in the black robe, courage returned to Brett again, he felt very embarrassed for his wolverine in front of the black robe Shame, but the anger produced by shame is not toward himself but toward the wizard of the black robe. "Wait awkward, you will regret it!" This is of course the roar of the defeated dog. Even Brett himself knows that there is not much that can be achieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's in front of you!" at the front of Lev to the back The companion made this gesture, and the people behind him immediately alerted that everyone was ready for the battle. With the approaching of the Temple of the Undead, the core of the Undead Island, the adventurers are no longer able to reassure them. They are divided into two teams. Lev is in front, others are behind and waiting for the thieves to send them. Warning sign. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have been on this scorched earth for a day, although the land underfoot is still the same black scorched earth, but the land is no longer as flat as before, but There have been ups and downs, and the smell of corpse smell has begun to fill in the air. Everyone knows that they are getting closer and closer to danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When everyone bends forward, Lev is squatting on the ground, and it is obviously suspicious in front. A row of people saw what Lev suspected. At the limit of the field of vision, a lot of humanoid things were standing there and motionless, and there was a strong smell in that direction, as if something was rot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s not the bodies that have just been brought over!" said Behan, although he said "no" but the meaning is "very likely" . It’s really like, if it’s true, then these corpses are sure to have become the result of the sorcerer’s shackles, and approaching them means an unavoidable battle. But these corpses are reflected in the route of the adventurers, they must pass here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that this conflict is inevitable. Of course, it should be Warcraft first, and the summoner can now come in handy. The red nose boss's Warcraft is a thick armor monster that has appeared once before, and Babe called out a blue-colored illuminator that emits electro-optic light. Now Kim is looking at the actions of the two summoners carefully. The red nose boss carefully drew a symbol on his left hand (painted with his fingers) and then placed his left hand on the ground. The Warcraft rose from the ground, but Babe only briefly closed his eyes, then she The Warcraft suddenly popped out of the air. As the Red Nose boss said, her World of Warcraft was summoned out of thin air. Two World of Warcraft passed by, if there are no undead wizards to command these bodies, then these guys will rush one by one and be destroyed in front of the World of Warcraft they can't beat, if there is a necromancer command The adventurers also took the initiative. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two World of Warcraft apparently came to the group of corpses, but they did not move, as if there was nothing there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Those are not the undead!" The red-nosed boss made a judgment. It seems that his connection with Warcraft is obviously stronger than that of Beibei. He can feel World of Warcraft. Will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adventurers walked up with hesitation, but they soon saw the creepy truth. As the Red Nose boss said, these are not the dead warriors under the control of the Necromancer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These things that seem to be corpses are actually stone pillars, but each stone pillar is sealed with a human body. These human beings are not entirely enclosed in stones (if that is the case, they can't be seen), but some of the bodies are merged in different postures and stones, and it looks like a dead body standing there. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
