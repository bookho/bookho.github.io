			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 01<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dark Continent is a continent much smaller than the lost continent, the size With only 20 million square kilometers, there are about 200,000 human beings living in this land, all living on the coast adjacent to the lost continent. Wei’s hometown is here, in this beautiful and rich land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the beginning of this land, human beings living in the dark continent have always faced the threat of other races, and numerous blood and fire contests have given this land. The two customs of humanity, extreme martial arts and extreme unity. On the dark continent, marrying a daughter to a man who is not brave is the greatest shame of being a father. Only when he becomes a warrior can he get a woman she loves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The humans on the dark continent have begun to have a national form, based on a large tribe, and human beings have formed a nation. The king was elected from the tribal chiefs, although it was a lifetime system but not hereditary. Although it is a king, it only has two privileges: the palace in the city (in the eyes of the lost human beings, it is only a relatively big house to go) and command war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kingdom has only one small standing army, all of which are composed of the most brave warriors. When a large-scale war occurs, people will blew the horn for communication. To the horn, all the people who can fight will gather in the kingdom to form an army to meet the enemy. The so-called Wangdu is actually the only city in the dark continent, and the only port in Heiyuncheng. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This city is small, but it is the only point of contact between the two continents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei was born in a small tribe far from the north of Black Cloud City. Wei's father was the chief of the tribe and the first warrior. When Wei was five years old, he was killed as a mad warrior in the battle with the rats. (The rat is a unique race in the dark continent. The body is like a human head but like a mouse. There is also a tail. The rats live in caves. They make holes in the land and turn the fertile land into a wilderness. The rats and humans are very Strong hostile relationships, although they will make and use weapons, they are more accustomed to fighting with their claws and teeth. Rats live an orderly group, they have always been a huge threat to humanity.)<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei did not have much impression of my father. His understanding of his father was all heard from other people. However, because of his father's relationship, his family is highly respected in the tribe. Wei is the second child at home. He has a brother and two sisters. Like other children, Wei’s ideal when he was a child was to become a warrior. It would be better to be a mad warrior like a father and a glorious battlefield. (The Berserker is a unit of mankind developed for wars with other superior races. They are the death squads in the army. Whenever other ethnic groups invade, in order to defeat the enemy, humans will choose the strongest warriors as a madman. Warrior. The person chosen as the Berserker will first hold a funeral at home, and then go to the battlefield as the leading force. Before the battle, the Berserker will be naked and painted on his body with a pattern that symbolizes his own tribe. They will drink the wine made with the drunken grass that is unique to the dark continent. The effectiveness of the drunken grass will soon occur, and the Berserkers will no longer feel the pain, nor will they have horror and reason. They only It will simply judge the enemy and me, then wave the weapon in hand to rush to the enemy. They fight fiercely, and the injury will only make them more excited. As long as life is still there, they will not stop fighting, and their potential will be fully exerted. Come out, endless, and tireless, any race will be afraid of the Berserker. It is with the Berserker that human beings can be in the dark continent. Standing firm and fighting for more than a thousand years with other dominant races. Although no Berserker can survive in battle, becoming a Berserker is the common ideal of all young people.)<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like other children, Wei began to learn to use a variety of weapons at a very young age. In fact, Wei is the strongest child in the tribe, and no one of his peers can He contested, even if he was five or six years older than him, he was not his opponent. In the year when Wei was ten years old, there was a change in the fate of Wei. A stranger came to the tribe where Wei was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This person is already very old, and his white beard and hair have exposed this, but his eyes are still stunned and his body is still strong. He wore an armor on his body and the sword in his waist. These two things were not the style of the dark continent. People in the tribe saw that he was a warrior from other places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This knight (We later learned that he was a knight) lived in the tribe, and he easily defeated the strongest warrior in the village in the contest - - Wei's uncle. (The custom of the dark continent, when a person wants to move to another tribe to live, he must defeat a warrior in the tribe to prove his bravery, will not become the burden of this tribe.)<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, Wei is no exception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among all the children, the teacher (so everyone calls him) has chosen Wei alone, he found a rare talent in this child, he is determined Carve Wei into a piece of jade. He used the paladin's standards to ask the child from the beginning! Wei is indeed a talented person. He endured the teacher's extremely strict training. At the age of fifteen, Wei mastered the saga of the sword wind and became the strongest soldier in the village. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the age of ten to nineteen, it’s been a good time to be in Wei’s now! ! ! Since the last defeat of the Rat (that is, the death of Wei's father), humans have not had any large-scale war, and the entire tribe is full of joy. It seems that peace will no longer leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We grew up in the strict training of the teacher. At the age of seventeen, Wei was a well-known warrior. The teacher was also pleased to see his students at this age. It is already possible to use vindictiveness. Wei’s fame grew in the test of his teachers. He did not have bows and arrows in the summer. He could fight the most ferocious Warcraft with a sword. In winter, he wore a 60-kilogram armor to swim 20 kilometers in the water to attack the rats. The human nest (呜呜, is simply Superman). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher is very curious about the drunken grass. He always wanted to know why the wine made by drinking this thing would become a mad warrior. He even took himself and Wei. To experiment, of course, only drink a small amount. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a very magical experience. After drinking a little drunkenness, Wei feels full of blood and his body is full of strength, and he is very eager Fighting can't even suppress this impulse, and his teacher is the same. Fortunately, both of them still have reason, they use the sword of practice to vent their impulses. After a few minutes of competition, Wei felt another feeling. It was a feeling of paralysis. Now I know why the "paralysis" of the dark wind is ineffective against Wei.) The feelings of the whole body are gone, hollow, and then very strong. The excitement came, the impulsive impulse and the killing yu hope to occupy the brain, almost drove out the reason, Wei suddenly felt extremely bloody, in order to satisfy this crazy thought, Wei stabbed a hole in his hand. . But the teacher did not act, he could still fight this yu hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wound on the hand is not painful at all, the smell of blood is really sweet, just like the attraction of the same bowl of wine to a drunkard, want more The bloody impulse was almost impossible to restrain. Fortunately, the teacher had already defeated the bloodthirsty yu hope. He yelled Wei Qing to wake up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also secretly drank a few times drunken grass wine in the future, he wants to beat the bloodthirsty cherish like the teacher, but he fails every time Every time I drank drunken grass wine, Wei was awake over a large body of Warcraft's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These stupid experiments left a consequence. Wei’s impulses of extreme emotions would be maddening, and several times Wei would hurt himself to get a bloody taste. After the teacher knew that Wei had smacked a meal, he had to ask Wei to put on a whole body, and he was mad and self-inflicted. He thought Wei’s direction was good. Who knows if Wei is really mad, he will Will not find someone to vent). Of course, he also asked Wei to strictly control his emotions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remembering the stupid things of the past, Wei’s face could not help but smile, how happy it was at that time! My sister, mother, brother, uncle, and teacher will scold me, but now, even if I want to hear their snoring, I can only dream. The babe on the shoulder shook a bit, the wine broke out, the little girl could not support it, and she couldn't sit still, but the hotel was not far ahead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is asleep, but Kim has a question before going to sleep, he thinks about Elna’s therapist’s gown, why is there under the black side? What about Phnom Penh? Although he did not know the reason, he understood that Elna was definitely not an ordinary primary therapist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next game is really boring, Wei almost all of them have all the games (of course, other people have the opportunity to show off). As long as he stands in the ring, most of his opponents are arrogant, and the rest are not admitted to the game after a few rounds. Wei, who is serious, is simply invincible (he wants to get the sword of destruction). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Emperor Nikolai admired the finals in the audience. He watched Wei use a series of storms to push his opponent to the side of the ring, and then use the vindictiveness to put the The unlucky guy is blowing to the downfall. Although Wei still defeated two people, Nikolay did not think it was necessary to continue watching. He waved his hand and a guard came over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s them," Nikolay said, a few of them, "You go to tell the Foreign Minister, they are."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; the depths of the palace, there is a room looks very ordinary, but if you look carefully, you will find the room a bit different. Every window in the room was fitted with bronze railings. Except for one door, the other doors were blocked. Outside the only door, there were twelve fully armed guards. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; when Emperor Nicholas went to the door of the room, being a ladies room side out, she saw the Emperor hurried salute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor waved her hand to signal her up, and then asked: "How is the princess now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Back, the princess is all right now, she is no longer crying, and she begins to eat and sleep normally. Everything is normal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh "The emperor was a little surprised. He knew his daughter's temper. He didn't think his daughter would compromise so soon." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure she has nothing unusual?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, I am sure, I am today After thoroughly inspecting the house, I found nothing. The princess even asked me to give her lipstick and other cosmetics?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nikolay was greatly comforted. "I didn't think that my daughter finally began to obey. I won't go in today, and I will avoid any troubles." He remembered Melia's own eyes two days ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned back and said to the Guardian of his side, "It seems that the guards at the door can be removed, and the twelve are too conspicuous."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Guard nodded again and again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly the emperor seems to think of something "but don't all withdraw, leave one or two, do you know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;第02节<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now facing the last opponent, who used his fierce combo to force his opponent back. The voice in the audience was higher than a while, and now the champion of the contest has no suspense. The people who gambled outside the Kaige Square have begun to gamble on how many rounds Wei’s opponent can support, instead of whether he can win. The long sword was picked up and the opponent's warhammer came out. Wei put the sword against the other's chest, and the victory and defeat were divided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the applause of the audience, a referee took the stage and announced that the group of gold won the championship of the contest, they will receive six treasures as prizes. Moreover, they will be hand-picked by Nikolai III in the Imperial Palace tomorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were six people excited that night, and everyone agreed when Leif proposed to drink again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time they are the best hotel in the city of Delante, six people on the banquet to give the treasures that have not yet arrived, gold is of course magic The book, Wei Tie Ding is the demon sword, Behan wants the frozen rose (the rose that has been processed with the magic that has been lost, touched very cold, never fades but always bright, precious decorations), Lev took the magic crystal The robe (the gown used by the Holy Light Magician at the ceremonies is gorgeous), and Elna gets a sacred silver necklace (a necklace made of rare metal, sacred silver, which is completely immune to the dark magic - the law of the king. It was made by the human magician during the undead war.) The smallest babe got the last one - the dragon tooth dagger, this is the Lord Erna, she thinks that Babe has also been on the ring (heard this sentence Lev's face is red), I should get one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lev has calculated his own value and is in a good mood. This magic crystal robes can be worth at least two hundred magic crystal coins, which can be said to be A windfall. In his spare time, he suggested that it is not interesting to drink alcohol alone. It is good to call a band to play. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; at this hotel several bands always, the waiter quickly found a four-piece band came to serve them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The band’s skills are good. After listening to the music for a while, I don’t know who proposed to sing. This opinion is fully utilized by two men with ulterior motives (this is a good opportunity to praise the beauty of the sex, but also a good opportunity to get the heart), just as everyone is waiting for the song of Elna, Babe is Stand up and announce that you want to sing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The song produces a powerful temptation. It is a temptation full of death but sweet and abnormal. Everyone feels that the biggest goal of his life is in front of him. Just go up and listen to the little girl’s instructions, and his goal can be To achieve, your own ideals can be achieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four musicians were the first to succumb to the temptation, they stopped playing and squatted in front of Babe, but Babe did not stop because of them. She played and stopped singing, and she herself was already in a state of embarrassment. Her singing became more and more beautiful and louder and louder. She began to float out of the hotel and spread to the crowded streets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five people at the table are the most tempted, even if they are experienced adventurers and warriors who are war-torn The temptation to break away, but they have a little resistance to resistance, they are now using the last point of reason to resist this powerful temptation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold’s thought is completely paralyzed. He just instinctively knows the power of death in this voice, so he will resist the present and he will be here. When the temptation yields, an energy is transmitted from the ring in his hand, encircling him, and this force forms a filter that filters out the magic in the song of Babe. What Kim is hearing now is just a beautiful girl’s voice, although it’s good, but it’s the level of the little girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold looked around, leaving only Elna and Wei still resisting, the goddess served by the former gave her strength, and the latter relied entirely on herself. The will to exercise is in support. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s the Pluto Law!" A voice in the golden heart yelled, only the power of Pluto (and, of course, the other five death gods) could produce this fullness. The temptation of death. But this is impossible. I have never heard of a living person who can use the Pluto method. There is only one race in the world that can use the power of Pluto - the Necromancer (the human magician invented the contract with the Pluto in order to obtain eternal life). The horror magic, the magician who casts this magic will lose his life, but he can get the power that always exists in the world and become the necromancer.) <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Someone is manipulating Beibei?" Kim noticed that Beibei is not in a normal state now, and she seems to be unable to control herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is no time to find out who is controlling Babe, the temptation of the song begins to change, and the magic in the song begins to ask people who succumb to the temptation to die Jin saw that Behan began to pull out the sword of the earth, and Lev also reached out to the knife on his waist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What to do!" Kim panicked, he couldn’t attack Babe, and he couldn’t stop the person who was dying. The scope of the song’s influence was too great (even if To stop the front, there are still many people on the street.) <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right!", the days of Kim in the Stone Tower are not white, he finally remembered a way at this critical juncture, "as long as people can be The interference of other sounds will do, as long as the sound of the interference is large enough to cover the song, the magic in the song will be lost. Although it will make everyone's ears suffer, but don't care so much!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold begins to use the magic sound (see Chapter 1 for details), terrible, deafening sounds erupt (gold uses all the magic), the sound is strong, even The scorpion can also be quarreled in a hundred steps, and no one in the whole city of Delante can hear this scream. The voice of Kim completely overpowered Babe’s voice, and all the people who were controlled by the songs recovered their senses (but the ears were also horribly devastated). Babe also recovered from the loud noise of Kim, and she quickly pressed her hand to her ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the six-person squad began to drink, a woman in the Royal Palace in DeLand began to act. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the door of a guard with twelve soldiers, only two people are now guarding. The emperor is not worried about too few people. Indeed, as long as soldiers stand outside the door, they are not afraid that Princess Melia will run away, no matter how many soldiers are. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door opened silently and did not attract anyone’s attention. The eyes in the door were closed after seeing only two people at the door. Going back, the door was closed again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After ten minutes, a clear door opening caused the two soldiers to turn their bodies over, standing in front of their eyes, standing Princess Melia. She didn't have any makeup on her face, but she applied a very strong lipstick. She wore an ordinary dress (or ordinary for the court, quite gorgeous for the common people). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, Princess Melia, the emperor ordered us to leave the room no matter what, otherwise we will cut our heads. Princess, please don't be embarrassed!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you not let me leave anyway?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please forgive me, this is the order we accept!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really not let me go..." Melia said as she approached the two guards, and suddenly she took a guard and did not pay attention, grabbed his face, He kissed his mouth. Despite a gentle kiss, enough lipstick has been left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Princess, what are you doing!" The guard pushed Melia away, and Melia had just met another guard in the retreat, so both soldiers had The experience of kissing with the princess (this life may only have one experience, so blessed). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You listen, if I am yelling at you now, you will have any consequences, I believe that you are very clear, and the lipstick on your lips is a deny. Evidence that can't be lost. If you want to wipe off the lipstick now, I will call it immediately!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The older of the two guards already know how to return It’s a thing. He gave up the idea of ​​wiping off the lipstick immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, if we let you go, our heads will also land."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "It doesn't matter, you see, that's it!" The princess took out a chair that had been there for a long time. The chair was engraved with a luxurious pattern but it was heavy and strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two guards glanced at each other, and the older guard tried to make the last effort: "Okay! Let us put lipstick before we stun us." Wipe it off and avoid trouble." "No!" Melia sees through this trap. "When you pass out, I will wipe it for you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Two poor guards had to accept the reality, after all, one more bag on the head is better than the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 03<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Royal Palace, there were two sounds that no one noticed. The dull percussion, then the human body slamming a little louder than the impact - of course, no one noticed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A team of guards marched along a fixed patrol route, they were in the middle of the night The last patrolmen in the area, after their footsteps went away, a figure came out of the corner where she was hiding and ran towards a door. When Melia was a child, she escaped from the guards and sneaked out of the palace without any practice. She knew the path to leave the palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the ecstasy of Melia’s heart. This is the way she found out in the hour. She has climbed this tree many times. Then jump from the extended branches to the palace wall and then slide outside the palace. Here, as in other times, no one is there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the cover of the night, Melia swayed through a team of guards patrolling outside the palace wall (in fact, her heart was nervous), disappeared In the streets of the city of Delante. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five people are sitting in an ordinary tavern in the city of Durant, the tavern is very deserted. There is no reason for anyone here to discuss the contest of the contest, because there is a person who was defeated at the contest, and one person was beaten to defeat the defeated. Edward is drinking a bite of alcohol, and several of his friends are looking at him with a look of concern, but they also know that it is useless to comfort him with any words. Maybe wine is his only medicine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To be honest, several of Edward’s friends are really afraid that he will not think about it. They are all good comrades in life and death. They can't bear to look at Edward like this, but what can they do? I can only stare at Edward carefully, and I will not let him do anything impulsive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a bang, the door of the pub was opened, the door opening was so loud that all the people couldn’t help but look back. Coming from outside the door is a woman, a woman who runs out of breath. Although she estimated that no one would find her escape before the dawn, Melia ran to the pub at the fastest speed (Edward once told her to live here). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melia made a three-step, two-step rush through the inconvenient table and chairs and came to Edward's side. The latter did not think that Melia would appear here at this time, he was completely shocked, and even the wine glasses in his hand forgot to let go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Honey...Leah..." Edward's lips could only squeeze out these words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I looked at Edward’s stumbling, Melia’s anger didn’t come in. She grabbed the glass and fell to the ground. - Behind the sound of the tavern boss's regret, he felt deeply sorry for this innocent wine glass, but he knew that the guests would compensate for the loss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry for...!" Edward himself did not know why he apologized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don’t say sorry to me, Edward I like is not like this, he is not a man who is frustrated because of a failure!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But, but, Melia..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is great in being defeated in the ring, Since being a warrior, being defeated is inevitable! Is there anything worthy of apology?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miliya’s words evoke the pain in Edward’s heart The failure in the ring not only made him feel sorry for Melia, but also let him taste the bitterness of defeat. This bitterness has not been tasted for a long time, since he left his adoptive father. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Melia, I have not been able to honor my promise, I have not... no face to see you! Maybe I really can't deserve you, you are after all .......""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop!" The woman in front of Edward looked very angry. In fact, if she was not born in the Emperor's House, she was well received. If she is polite, she may be violent. There was both the father's rudeness and the mother's gentleness in Melia's blood vessels. However, the part of her father had taken the initiative under the heat generated by her running. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look at me!" Melia was close to Edward's body. "Look at my eyes!!!" She stopped Edward from moving back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you like me very much, love me very much? Say it!!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Yes! Melia, I only love you one!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want to marry me, and stand in the ring to compete with those powerful fighters?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not doing it for me, already Do you fight as much as you can?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...for..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are Didn't it be defeated by the opponent after defeating the three strong enemies?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Say!!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Yes..." Although Edward knew that he couldn’t beat Wei under normal circumstances, at this time He said that no one can blame him for lying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's it, you don't have to take any responsibility for this defeat! If you want to say responsibility, it's all that set the damn rules." The guy's fault (the Guardian sneaked a sneeze) Who is saying that I am swearing?")."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Melia!" Edward understood Melia The mind, he can not help but hold Melia tightly in her arms, holding Melia almost breathless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Edward returned, blushing and letting Melia be released, but Melia did not leave his arms, she looked up and put Lips are attached to the lips of the lover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two people once again hugged together and kissed tightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edward's friends have long since known to leave, and have cleared all the "light bulbs" in the pub. When the two were separated, only the tavern owner who was ignorant was still standing on the counter and washing the dishes. He looked like a commonplace, but instead gave two people more embarrassment. Melia's face is like a red apple, and she is now shy of being bold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kim’s breath was finally spit out, and everyone has returned to normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the undisappeared Wei and Elna, other people have a confused look on their faces, including Babe. The unique look that was scared by the sudden sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why are you so loud!" Lev was the first to die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, it’s too loud! The song can't be sung like this!" Babe echoed on the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold understands what is going on - everyone has no memory, but he has no time to explain, people outside the hotel are coming in I am going to teach the guy who made such a loud noise. It’s the only choice for these people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the hotel, Kim finally took a breath. He escaped two crises today, the magic of temptation in the voice of Babe and the fist of the angry masses. Others are also relieved. Only Lev was stealing: they fled with chaos, and even the hotel’s money was not paid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who is going to go with us, manipulating Beibei?" Jin’s heart had another question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, a couple is working together, the man takes out a diamond brooch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, although I have not fulfilled my promise of victory, at least I can return this to you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Stupid, I lend you this is not for your victory, but I hope that you will come back to me safely. (The following is a large paragraph of sweet words)"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; In the early morning of the next day, the Royal Palace was in a mess. At this moment, Emperor Nikolay was interrogating two unlucky guards who were found to have passed out on the ground and their guarded room opened. Princess Melia did not know where to go. But <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s two people who don’t tell the truth for their own heads. They only say that they don’t know anything and they are inexplicably stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor was almost violent to release the city’s martial law, but he immediately thought that this might be the masterpiece of his baby daughter, so he was full of belly The anger is pressed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the emperor was walking, considering how to get the daughter back - this time must stand at the door of a whole squadron guard - - A guard came up and reported that the winner of the contest was already waiting in the main hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor remembered this file. He didn’t want to play this disgraceful character today. Now he just gave him a step, so he instructed the guard to pay this matter. To the foreign minister to do it. "The old guy who is embarrassed is suitable for this kind of thing"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the guards left, the emperor muttered to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The winning six-person squad is waiting for the emperor's arrival. At this time, a guard came over and announced to them that the emperor's majesty was entangled in government affairs and could not be separated. The prizes were awarded to them by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and the location was next to the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This old guy is not like a good guy at all!" Lev saw the foreign minister to make this judgment. The Minister of Foreign Affairs is over sixty years old, but he does not have the kindness and stability of the elderly at all. On the contrary, he has a light forehead, a thin cheek, a pointed chin and a goatee beard. a feeling of. In fact, this is also the case. The Minister of Foreign Affairs is famous throughout the mainland for his cheeky and unrecognized credit. His greatest skill is to just sing a person and immediately praise him when he finishes a person, and praise it with the most vicious words. Use the most disgusting words of others. He is very thin, but it has nothing to do with malnutrition. It may be that the gods are not qualified to gain weight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Minister of Foreign Affairs is Nikola’s confidant, because this old guy can help him carry all his nicknames, such as not credit, see forgiveness, etc. Anyway, the bad guys are made by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and the good guys are made by Nicholas III himself. This optimal combination makes this old man's status unshakable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 04<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Foreign Minister scanned everyone with his sly eyes, and his face had an extremely classic false smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Warriors," the Minister of Foreign Affairs cleared his throat. "I am very happy to meet you. You have shown extraordinary courage and strength at the contest. It is enough to be worthy of being the master of these precious treasures! (The following is a slogan of three hundred words)"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...the warriors, now the whole continent is on the verge of crisis You must be happy to contribute your own strength for the future of mankind. There is such an opportunity in front of you. The Durant Empire needs a warrior like you to accomplish a difficult task. This task is related to losing the continent. The fate of all human beings."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of Foreign Affairs is very proud to see that three of the six have been impressed by his last sentence - Behan, Kim and Elna. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...The Emperor of the DeLand Empire decided that if you could accept the commission of the Empire, you would be given a huge reward of 3,000 magic crystal coins,..." Now that Lev, who has been resentful to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, has also been shaken by this number. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And, you will be the hero of everyone's admiration..." The little girl couldn't help herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now only Wei has not been convinced, but he did not show the meaning of opposition, so the Minister of Foreign Affairs feels that his purpose has been achieved. "You can discuss it first!" The Minister of Foreign Affairs expressed generosity to the public after confirming that his purpose was achieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you all agree to accept the commission of the Empire?" Behan told his companions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to know the content of this task first!" Kim proposed, he really has some doubts about the old man's words. Everyone exchanged opinions and finally made a decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello, I think we should first know the content of this difficult task before we promise this commission." Jin said to the Minister of Foreign Affairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as you promise, you will naturally know the content." The foreign minister who is savage and savvy is not the one who will easily put things out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold and everyone exchanged a look, "Well, if this task is really related to the future of all mankind as you said, we will promise!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Foreign Minister showed a smirk and he waited for this sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I believe everyone knows that there have been a lot of Warcraft in our country recently. In recent times, the Adventurers' Union is full of tasks that require the removal of Warcraft. Moreover, the place where Warcraft appears is not only a remote place. Even those places that have not been seen by Warcraft for hundreds of years have been harassed by Warcraft."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;金和Lev remembered the Wyvern that died under their hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Moreover, this phenomenon is not a patent of the Delante Empire. According to intelligence, all the cities and countries that have lost the entire continent are now subject to Warcraft. Attacks. Over time, Warcraft has appeared more and more, as if they all grew up in the ground, without any warning. After killing, there will be a new one."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold thinks of the lizard elders, the two-legged dragon suddenly appeared without any warning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although we know that the vitality and fertility of Warcraft are very strong, it is impossible to have a large-scale appearance like this without the power behind the scenes. Now, All countries have been affected by Warcraft, and some of the more remote places have even been cut off by Warcraft. We believe that these Warcraft appeared because some people used transfer magic to send these Warcraft, and must be powerful, purposeless transfer magic. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone listened quietly, no one interrupted the words of the Minister of Foreign Affairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "According to all the information now, this kind of behavior cannot be done by a certain country, or even it will never be done by human beings. On the lost continent, only A race has enough hatred and enough power to do this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened to those scouts?" Elna raised a question - a rash problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They said they would go to Undead Island for further investigation, and then there would be no news!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sure enough!" Everyone knows what the fate of these people is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold began to understand what kind of dangerous tasks this time will face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...So, Nikola held this contest, and wanted to pick out a group of real warriors to investigate the actions of the Necromancers. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is silent, because everyone knows what it means to go to Undead Island." Only Lev is on the side: "It’s too uneconomical to go to Undead Island to give only 3000 magic crystal coins. This is not a general danger."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Ladies and gentlemen, this time you go to Undead Island, in addition to being able to bring back information, you are best – if possible – to destroy the plans of the Necromancers and let the humans suffer less.”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait a minute, we haven't promised to go yet!!" Lev hurriedly spoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No promise??" The Foreign Minister revealed his usual awkward smile. "You just said that as long as the tasks related to the future of mankind are accepted, isn't this enough?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lev, he regrets because he I have vowed not to deal with people who have this kind of vision, but this time I am still planted in this kind of person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Leif’s mind was moving, and he thought of a good idea. Lev's plan is very simple. If you get the treasures and money and leave the Durant Empire, then nothing will happen. They only use the area around Undead Island. (If you can't even do this, you will be too sorry.) Look carefully at the news, and then pass the news to the city of Delante, you don't have to go to the dangerous place of Undead Island, no one will determine if they have been to Undead Island. The idea was fixed, and Lev’s face showed a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We must not be responsible for it, we must complete the task!" Lev said these words in a fearless manner, and his companions looked at him. I don't know what medicine is sold in his stomach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of Foreign Affairs laughed and he already knew that his plan (Emperor ???) was successful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The courage of all of you is really admirable, I hope that you can safely complete the mission back." The Foreign Minister said these typical guest words, in fact, he does not believe Just six people go to Undead Island and they can all come back safely, but as long as one can come back to report. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, although we believe in you, this fact is too important, and this task is too dangerous. I think, everyone. Treasures should be temporarily placed here for me. It is better to give them back when you come back safely. It is too easy to attract attention with these treasures, and it is easy to reveal whereabouts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Leif hate to beat himself a slap in the face, this old and slick old thing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of Foreign Affairs instructed the guards to take the prizes that were placed aside. On the other side, Wei Zai couldn't stand it anymore. He rushed forward and blocked the guards holding the treasure. Wei must not let the demon sword that is about to get rid of from his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Wei’s anger, a pair of martial artists, the old guy frightened and retreated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You...what are you doing?" The old guy also saw the power of Wei in the contest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I was very happy to see the old man’s face whitish, but could not conflict with the old man here, Lev stepped forward to block Wei. Wei Wei Lefu connected several gestures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leif would like to turn over and say to the Minister of Foreign Affairs: "Sorry, sir, but I want to have one thing you made a mistake. This sword will not be ours." Obstacles to completing the task, because it will become our good strength. I think we should take it on the road."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a minute, this magic book is different, you can't read it...." The foreign minister has not wanted to fight with Wei to destroy the magic sword. Except for the reason of the other party, it is feared that Wei Hui will be the main force on the spot. s reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand!" Kim took the magic book and opened it. Anyway, no matter what he said he could not refute others - others could not understand . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呜..." The blond snorted, his eyes saw the inside of the magic book, and the magical ban on the book worked. What Kim saw was just a colorful thing. Magic played a role in Kim. After staying in the book for five or six seconds, Kim could not see anything around him. He could only see it in his eyes. The chaotic color in the magic book. Kim closed his eyes, but the power of magic began to interfere with Kim's brain. It was useless to close his eyes. The chaotic colors and characters still hovered in Kim's mind, making Kim feel very painful. Gold clasped his head helplessly, and the magic book fell on the ground. The Minister of Foreign Affairs won. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The young man is really impulsive," the foreign minister picked up the magic book, and he pretended to be a fake scorpion. "It doesn't matter, it will be good after an hour." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold was recovered halfway back to the hotel, when Behan was holding him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s really a legendary big magician. It’s just a little magic that works on books. It’s such a power. Can you have such power? Hey, don’t think about it, as long as you can be like a teacher, thank you very much.” Jin side and other people screamed at the shameless old man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 05<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The six returned to the hotel and everyone began to discuss the next move, the foreign affairs The minister is worthy of being a man trusted by the emperor. He saved all the savings that the emperor can save - three thousand magic crystal coins will not be given until they return - if they can come back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be honest, the name of Undead Island is the object of all human fears, like a bloody young man like Kim who is going to go to Undead Island. Can not help but retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Humans cannot forget the terrible nightmare that the Necromancers brought to them, the undead war that almost destroyed humanity. The history of mankind has detailed the catastrophe. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of the Continental calendar in 865, when the Reiter Empire was the strongest force on the mainland, the Leite Empire occupied nearly half of the land lost on the mainland. It is very important to reunite the mainland after the Holy Light Dynasty. At that time, the war on the mainland continued, and all other countries united to form an alliance to counter the threat of the Leite Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Necromancer is launching an attack on humans under such circumstances. In June 865, more than 1,400 undead wizards (Desperate Wizards) The number is not many, but they are all converted by powerful magicians. The commander is a 1.5 million-strong soldier. (The soldiers are made by the undead wizards with the power of Pluto. The raw materials are mostly human bodies. Although actually the necromancer They are made of dead warriors, but because the flesh and blood are perishable, they often only have cockroaches. The soldiers’ combat ability is not strong. Any trainee swordsman can easily flatten a warrior. Only a sufficient number will pose a threat. They are actually just dolls, completely controlled by the necromancers.) Starting from Undead Island, crossing the sea into the territory of the Leite Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July, the Necromancers got the news at the beach, and the rioting empire army rushed to the battle, surrounded the human army with absolute superiority, not knowing the enemy. The 20,000-strong imperial army of the entire scale was completely annihilated, and those corpses were relatively complete and became new members of the Undead Legion. Then, the Undead Legion captured two small cities nearby. The residents of the city, regardless of men, women and children, joined the Undead Legion. The Necromancers even let the dead people quit, and they dig the grave. The number of soldiers has increased rapidly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September, the Undead Legion once again fought the imperial army and defeated the Imperial Army again, but some human cavalry broke through the encirclement and succeeded in the Undead Legion. The situation brought back. The Leite Empire recognized the crisis. In October, the Reiter Empire assembled all the mobile units and prepared to compete with the undead army. The Imperial Army with 420,000 soldiers is in the city of Cartel (a big city in the south, of course, it has long since disappeared). The suburbs meet the undead army that is advancing. The fighting was fierce, humans prevailed at the beginning, human warriors chopped each one with a sword, and the magician used magic to smash these skeletons. Although the soldiers lost a lot of money, the soldiers would not be afraid, would not retreat, and would not be able to escape. The reduction of their companions would not affect their continued combat. On the third day of the battle, when the human warriors were tired, the magician's magic was used almost the same - the soldiers were only one-fifth of the soldiers - the necromancers entered the battlefield. They combined the complete parts of the fallen soldiers into new sergeants, and let the dead human warriors join them. Of course, they also used magic to attack the human army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark days came, and the southern part of the Reiter empire completely lost the protection of the army and was exposed to the undead army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Necromancer has captured more than 60 cities, regardless of whether human beings are resisting or surrendering, and they are treated equally. They killed everyone they could find, plus a large number of excavations, and the number of soldiers increased to more than a million. Then, the undead soldiers split into several ways and marched into the hinterland of the lost continent. Mankind is facing an unprecedented crisis, and the necromancers are full of hatred of the souls, they want to kill all human beings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tragic "war of the city of burning" began, and humanity fought desperately and heroically. When the undead army was under the city, all human beings went to the wall to fight for defense. They burned all the dead bodies and seriously wounded people with fire. When the city was about to fall, the desperate humans ignited the fire and turned the whole city together with themselves into ashes. Even the ancestors’ bodies were dug out and burned together. Don't let the Necromancer get a little benefit. The Necromancers attacked more than a hundred cities in succession, but all faced the same result. The human beings in despair really gave up all hope and carried out a decisive battle. The Necromancer cursed this area in anger and turned the land into a desert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This resistance, although not able to stop the undead army, provided enough time for humans to assemble the army, and each country gave up its prejudice The threat to this death, this is the first time humanity has united since the collapse of the Holy Light Dynasty. In the seat of the temple of the goddess of life, Leica, the grassland known as the "Garden of Leica" (here, the power of the six gods will be weakened to a minimum), with the human and necromancers commanded by the Emperor of Leite A decisive battle. The fierce battle of this battle simply surpassed the "blood lake battle" during the Liberation War. Although under the protection of Leica, the war dead will not become a sergeant, but the necromancer can still be defeated by the fallen sergeant. The damaged parts make up the new squadron. In this way, the original 37 million soldiers have actually increased by half, while the human beings have only 2.2 million. The ocean of endless bones can make anyone feel desperate. However, the dragons appeared in the sky shortly after the war. The prince of the Reiter Empire called the Dragons with the "Dragon's Contract" and rushed to the battlefield in time. Thousands of dragons appeared on the battlefield and reversed the battle. The dragon used a terrible breath to turn the squadrons without airpower into ashes. Fire, freezing gas, thunder, and acid mist swept the entire undead army. The dragons used their terrible magic to send one angel after another to the arms of Pluto. With the help of the dragons, mankind finally won the final victory and defeated the terrible demons produced by human beings themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The necromancers fled under the pursuit of mankind, and when they fled back to Undead Island, their number had not even reached two hundred. Since then, the Necromancer has been honestly and without any change, but humanity lost one-fifth of the population in this war, and the Leite Empire, which suffered the most in the war, has never recovered from it and lost the opportunity to unify the mainland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recalling this history, Kim suddenly felt that he might be too savage, and the necromancers were all powerful masters of human beings, and how could six people Going back to Undead Island and returning safely? If he died, would he be turned into a sergeant? Will parents cry for their glorious sacrifice? What if everyone can't come back? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ayrna spoke, pulling gold back to reality from cranky thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Lev, Mr. Jin, this task is very dangerous, I think, you were not the contestants of the contest..."<br />< Tr />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lev interrupted her. "How can we say that we are partners now? It is because of danger that there is more talent and more strength. How can we leave?" "You say yes, gold?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes! We are participating together, of course, we must share this task together!" On the island of Undead, Kim could not help but feel ashamed of the idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about Babe?" Behan asked a question, "Can we always take her with us?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bebee is going too!" The little girl yelled. "Bebe, the island of Undead is a very dangerous place, and Beibei can't go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alna tried to convince Babe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where is that Beibei going?" The tears in the eyes of the little girl came out. "Beibei doesn't recognize the way home!, I don't care, I must go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aerna looked up at everyone, indeed, this little girl has nowhere to go now, if she is forced to leave her, one On the other hand, who knows what kind of Warcraft she will call, what caused the commotion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
