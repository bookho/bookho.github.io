Just came and solved one, and rushed up next to it. Wei sideways escaped the giant ants' long teeth, and next to Behan slammed into the gap, the sword of the earth swung, the head of the giant ant With the left half of the teeth left the body and flew away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no other giant ants rushing over, and the two quickly stepped back and joined other people. Several giant ants caught up and spit out a lot of acid to two people. I couldn’t hide it, but a strong wind blew from behind and pours the acid back to the giant ant colony. With the sound of “Zizi”, the bodies of several giant ants are touched by acid, and the hard shell It was dissolved, and one of them was completely dissolved in the entire head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lev opened the short bow and accurately shot the arrow into the mouth of a giant ant that was open to the mouth and intended to vomit the acid. The giant ant was subjected to A fatal blow, six legs softened, and the whole body became a black solid that would not move. The remaining more than a dozen giant ants continued to embrace without fear, launching a new round of attacks on six people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold fired another fireball, just hitting a giant ant in the head, but the flame did not stop it from attacking, and it continued to attack forward. Behan once again inserted the sword of the earth into the ground, and the energy ejected from the ground hit five giant ants, which were divided into two segments from the weakest waist. Wei Wei, the giant ant stopped the action and rushed up again. In the hands of the demon sword, two giant ants sent their lives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only three left, and Behan pulled the sword out of the ground and rushed up. The gold did not lose the opportunity to support with a wind blade. The remaining three Only the giant ants were finally destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a roar from afar, everyone was dignified because they knew that the Warcraft called out by Babe had been wiped out by the giant ants. Sure enough, immediately, there was a group of giant ants that were black and pressed in the distance, rushing over to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Babe, call a Warcraft again!" Elna shouted at the little girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, there is something in the interference, I have no way to summon them!" The little girl also panicked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What to do, you know that in this mountain, giant ants can run faster than people, and there is no hope of escaping. When everyone stopped to decide to meet the giant ants, Lev made a cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go there, yes, that's there!" Everyone followed Lev's finger and saw a naturally formed rock cave with a wide hole, enough for two Personally parallel. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people finally reached the rock gap before the giant ants arrived, Wei Shou was at the outermost, and the sword sent a giant ant that was not smashed up. West Heaven. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a narrow cave, giant ants can only enter one by one, just to give adventurers the opportunity to break through. After Wei killed the 30th giant ant, he finally retreated. He was already tired, but Behan immediately took over his position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We retreat to the back, Kim is using the magic of the wind to protect Behan, to prevent the acidity of the giant ants, and Lev uses his knife and bow to take the empty The giant ants shot one by one. Elna came up and she began to use healing to restore strength to Wei. After leaving more than 70 bodies, the giant ants finally began to retreat, and the adventurers could breathe a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn," Lev hated and threw his short bow on the ground. "There are only a few dozen giant ants. There are at least a thousand in this mountain." Only this reptile."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two days ago, six people crossed Dick The kingdom's borders enter the territory of Dick. Because of their adventurer status, Dick's border guards were politely not subject to their "transit handling fees" but asked them to bring a letter to a more remote village near the border. The village was originally responsible for providing ciders to the border guards, but I don’t know why it was not delivered in a week. Although the ciders in stock are still there, the officers felt that they should write a letter to remind them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone accepted the commission of the officer (so that you can get rid of the nasty immigration procedures) and set off to the village. Everyone was very nervous along the way, because this incident is likely to be related to Warcraft, but there was no trouble on the road, and it was smooth to the sweet wine village (the name of the village). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After reading the letter, the elders in the village explained to them the difficulties that the village is facing now. He hopes that the six adventurers can destroy the giant ants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Our village is not very rich, but you can come up with 100 gems for this!" said the elders. "Too little, we have to deal with giant ants. We don't know how much it will be destroyed by a single weapon. Only 100 gemstones are too little!" Lev knew that this place for producing high-quality cider would never be poor. The beautiful houses in the village are proof. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, the blacksmith in the village will unconditionally provide you with weapons, so that the total is OK!" Lev did not say anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elder, how many giant ants are there?" Jin asked, if you don’t know the number of enemies, it’s too dangerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you the captain?" The old man looked at the gold. "Although I don't know the exact number, but according to the person who saw the giant ant, probably There are dozens of heads."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing that he is the captain, Kim feels a bit strange, they have no team leader, everyone is equal. But Wei (who was a good captain) is a dumb. Lev and Behan (who has been a mercenary but has no experience as an adventurer) is fighting around Elna, and now the only one who can be sober The only consideration for interest is gold. It is also the golden idea to come to this village this time, because the future shipping fee must be very high, and the money can save the province (gold is economically minded, and Lev is only greedy). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dozens of it..." Kim looked at his companion, and everyone used his eyes to express the same meaning. "Well, we promised to eliminate it." Giant ants, tell us where giant ants often haunt..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beginning is still very smooth, the magic of gold plus Wei’s sword, others There are no opportunities for shooting. After three or two, more than a dozen giant ants are disposed of. The only loser of the adventurers was Wei's sword. After the sword was touched by the dark wind, he was in contact with the acid. He finally died, and Wei had to use the sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the adventurers encountered a crisis after reaching the giant ant nest, and hundreds of giant ants did not know where they came from, surrounded by six dare to invade The adventurers of their territory. This is a bitter battle. If it is not for Kim to let everyone put out the right team breakout, I am afraid everyone will die here. Wei used the vindictive spirit and the demon sword to open the road. Lev held the short sword. Then Jin and Beibei and Elna were in the middle. Two people protected the little girl, and Behan was behind the temple. The six people finally highlighted the heavy ants. At this time, everyone really felt that leaving Beibei was a very wise decision. If the World of Warcraft that Beibei summoned attracted the attention of most giant ants, six people could not escape this robbery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone recovered some of their strength under the treatment of Elna and started to discuss What to do in the future, now everyone's state is very bad, Wei's vindictiveness has been exhausted, and Behan's Earth Sword has exhausted all the power. Lev has only five arrows and seventeen knives, and the magic of gold is not. How much is left, Elna is the most tired one (the therapist can't recover his fatigue), Babe doesn't know why he can't summon Warcraft. It can be said that everyone is unable to fight with the giant ants again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leif walked out of the cave, there were several giant ants outside, they saw the enemy coming out, and immediately made a few sounds that humans could not hear, suddenly, giant The ants rushed out of the woods and shrubs, and Lev had to retreat. The giant ants did not attack, except for a few, they returned to their original places. Lev was very reluctant. He once again came out and hit a thin waist of a giant ant. The unfortunate giant ant finally fell to the ground after struggling for a while. But this has the opposite effect, the giant ants outside are also looking for a place to hide, dense trees and bushes provide a good cover, so that thieves can not confirm their position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lev told everyone about the situation outside, everyone was dignified. The sky is getting darker and darker, and in a few days it will be dark. It seems that giant ants are going to trap them here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although everyone has water and dry food, but not many (it was going to go back soon), only enough to eat a meal. What should I do now? Kim sat on the ground, everyone said nothing like him. Babe was very brave. She didn't cry, but like everyone else, she wanted to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 02<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is sitting in a circle, except for a whistle at the cave entrance They are eating their poor dinner. It will be very difficult tonight, they will have to go through this night without a bonfire and without a quilt. The wrong information provided to the elders of the liqueur village allowed them to put almost all their luggage in the village. This is the biggest mistake. Kim looked at the little girl sitting opposite. He is now admiring the babe’s father. He is very successful in educating his daughter. Babe is also licking hard bread, although everyone has to give her more Water, but the little girl refused, she thinks everyone should be equal. Just now everyone has decided to spend the night here, so that tomorrow morning, the adventurers will recover a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tonight, everyone has decided to split into five rounds of whistle (although Beibei has to be like others, but everyone refused her kindness), and those who didn't have a turn sat down in this not-so-large cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it’s only in October, the night in Dike, which is located in the north, is quite cold, and the damp and cold caves add to this chill. Kim noticed that Beibei was a little trembling. He took the little girl and hugged her in his arms. He noticed that the little girl fell asleep very quickly in her arms. Kim also couldn’t resist the drowsiness attack, and his eyes slowly closed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elna gently patted Kim’s shoulder and let him wake up from his sleep, now it’s his turn to be the last class. Kim handed the beibei, who was still asleep in his arms, to Elna, and walked to the hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the illumination of the ball of light, although the surrounding situation is not very clear, it is generally understood that the giant ants did not launch any at night. Attack, there is no change in the surrounding, no special sound is transmitted to the ear. It turned out that the giant ants would launch an attack at night, but it seems to be wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Kim thought of one thing - the giant ant might not be a World of Warcraft at night. This idea made him happy, and he immediately applied a sensory magic to see the movement around him. As expected, there is no living giant ant around, and there is no life reaction of any larger organism. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the ecstasy, Jin Chong into the hole, wake up all the companions, and explain the situation around you. Everyone’s thoughts are the same as gold, and now is the last chance to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pedestrians walk through the jungle in the night, and the vines hiding in the dark always give trouble to the adventurers, using their hateful body to put some Personal mixing has greatly slowed everyone's progress. However, when the first smear was revealed in the sky, everyone had already gone a long way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before you can see the smoke of the people in the liqueur village, everyone thought that when they finally left the sphere of power of the giant ants, they came from behind. Weird voice. Everyone heard that this was the sound of the giant ant colony moving forward, and everyone couldn’t help but turn around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hundreds of giant ants are rushing along the path that the adventurers have traveled, and the black-red body forms a wave of destruction. The first thought of everyone was to go to the village's retaining wall before the giant ant did not arrive. Wei picked up the babe and everyone ran to the village with the fastest speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the hillside closest to the village, everyone can breathe a sigh of relief. The village is only a few hundred meters away, but it’s still early to catch up with the giant ants. There is absolutely no problem in the protection wall of the village. But Kim suddenly thought of another thing, he stopped running. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most hardworking villagers have started their day's work. There are many women who are milking the grass outside the village. Men are caring for apples in the apple trees. Tree, a busy scene of labor. If the giant ants rushed over now, the consequences would be too serious, and the unprepared village might be destroyed. Moreover, if there is no one's defense, the retaining wall will not be able to block the attack of giant ants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone also stopped and looked at gold with suspicion, but Kim pointed out the villagers who didn’t feel anything. Everyone understood the gold. meaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but is there any way? Even in the hard battles of yesterday, they can only kill about 200 giant ants. It is impossible to block the surging giant colons in the current state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold looked at everyone’s anxious look, and suddenly there was a feeling of pride in the heart, and that pride and the shyness of the village of Noel’s family could not be protected in the past. Giving the courage of gold, he said: "I am dragging the giant ants, and everyone rushes to inform the villagers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it alone?" Lev is very clear about the power of Kim, and he knows that this matter goes far beyond the power of Kim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't look at me like this, although I can't destroy all these giant ants, but I still have to do it, after all, I am a magician! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We stared at the face of Kim, but Kim tried to make his face full of confidence. "Believe me, there will be nothing." Kim said to everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am with you!" Wei said to Kim in sign language, but Kim refused. "Sorry, but, Wei, if you are with me, I The plan cannot be realized."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the village, the horn of the alarm was heard. When people left their lives to run to the village, the giant ants also reached the hillside where Kim was. They saw the gold on the hillside and swooped at him immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold flew into the sky with a flying spell that was already prepared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant ants watched the enemy at a height that they couldn’t hurt, they screamed (of course, humans couldn’t hear) and hugged them around the enemy’s feet. The purpose of Kim is to delay enough time, he can not fly too high, otherwise the giant ants will lose interest in him and turn to attack the sweet wine village. When the attention of the giant ant began to shift, he lost the opportunity to land a certain height, a height enough for the giant ant to hurt him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant ants saw the enemy land, they stopped moving forward, began to circle the gold, and several giant ants just at the foot of the gold jumped up, trying They used their terrible big tongs to bite the gold, but Kim was very wary of this trick. He rose half a meter, allowing the giant ants to bite the air and then fall back to the ground. After being teased several times in this way, the giant ants began to spoil the enemy in the sky desperately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold is now taking a very thin wire, he wants to lower the height, attract the attention of the giant ants, let them jump and bite themselves, spray themselves The acid, but also to ensure his safety, he swayed on the wire, but still stood on the wire, did not fall in any direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The acid sprayed by the giant ants will eventually fall on their heads, but the giant ants will take the damage they have on the head of the magician in heaven. They are surrounded by gold more frantically in pain, using all the methods they can think of to attack him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold has long forgotten the time in this situation, he has repeatedly escaped the giant ants’ teeth and acidity again and again, another The acid sprayed, and the gold moved to the right to avoid these terrible acid. A giant ant that was jumping up unfortunately filled the position of the gold. It was sprayed with acid, before it fell to the ground. Its body has lost three legs. Kim had no way to care about the situation below. All his attention was to beware of the acid that was not sprayed from which angle and the large jaw that was bitten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time passed in the attack of the giant ant colony. In places where Kim did not know, people were hiding in the wall of the village, and Kim fought for them enough time. They even rushed into the village, and all the people picked up their weapons. Now it is time to inform the gold that the mission has been successfully completed. Lev and Wei went together on the hillside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eye-catching Lev saw the magician look up, he immediately understood why Kim could drag the giant ant for such a long time, he suddenly I thought of a way to destroy all the giant ants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lev pulled Wei back, he explained the plan to the fastest speed, the villagers agreed to the plan, everyone went home Take out the oil and start pouring the oil on the grass outside the village. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold is still playing hide-and-seek games with giant ants, giant ants are getting seven cigarettes from him, and at least thirty giant ants have died in the sky. The acid is under, but the giant ants have not given up the meaning of this game. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold was finally hit, after he escaped a spray of acid, a giant ant jumping from behind with his tongs The tooth bite the gold - fortunately, just biting the magician's gown. If the giant ant is usually complaining that his teeth are not sharp enough, now it has to complain that its teeth are too sharp. Under its sharp teeth, the magician’s robe is torn off, it can’t bring magic. The teacher pulled down from the sky. Similarly, if Kim is always hoping that his magician's gown can be stronger, now he can be glad that his magician's gown is not strong enough. Otherwise, he will end his life in the mouth of the giant ant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Kim was alone and a large group of giant ants were entangled, the villagers had completed the trap, and the whole meadow was filled with oil on the pile. The dry wood, now only waiting for the giant ants to come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 03<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leif and Wei once again ran to the hillside, although they did not It was very close, but there were already a few giant ants who noticed them. The giant ants vented all their anger to the two non-flyers, and they swooped over to the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but they are facing Wei. In the case of less than 20 and no acid spray, Wei does not put the giant ants in mind. Just two swords, the body of the two giant ants was added to the ground, then a mammoth and a cold arrow, and two giant ants were sent to the West. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flying bait in the sky heard Lev’s voice, he rose to a safe height, saw the clothed trap, and then he immediately resumed the function of the bait, but this time is a purposeful action, just like A hook has been added to the raft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant ants acted in the actions of Kim, and they walked into the trap without melancholy. When it was determined that the giant ants had all fallen into the trap, someone threw a torch on the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame rises, and the dry wood of the oil burns quickly. Without much time, the giant ant is surrounded by raging fire, and gold uses up all of it. The power of flying as high as possible, avoiding the fate of becoming bacon. The giant ants are baptized by the fire tongue. Although their outer shells have a good fireproof effect, the fire is too big. The high temperature causes the acid in their bodies to swell. One, two... one black and red body is inflated. The body fluid is squeezed out, the acid splashes out, and the flame is also promoted while eroding the companion. The burning effect of this acid is better than the oil. The end of the giant ant came, and humans in safe places made a burst of cheers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold is also smoked in the sky by the rising heat wave. He decided to transfer to a safe place when he determined that the giant ant could not escape the fire. He flew It was only after the emptiness of the wine village that it began to decline. Just as he fell halfway, he just saw the body of the last giant ant bursting open, and Kim finally breathed a sigh of relief. Kim landed in the village, and his companion came to welcome him. Kim felt that his body had been completely soaked by sweat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After two days of rest, the adventurers went up the mountain again, they killed the few remaining giant ants without any difficulty, and ruined The giant ant nest, the threat of giant ants to the sweet wine village was finally lifted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is sitting in the liqueur village to give the army a cider to leave the liqueur village. They are also grateful and promised to the villagers. 100 gem coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they left the Dike border guards and began to move north, the Emperor Nikolai was thundering in the Royal Palace of the Durant Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Waste, a group of waste, haven't found the princess until now! What are you doing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;A person lying on the ground cautiously replied, "Your Majesty, but it is too difficult to find a princess if you can't go door-to-door. We can only find it on the road now, as long as the princess does not come out in a certain house. We can't find her!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop, don't use these excuses to explain, what kind of excuses can't hide your incompetence. Listen On the one hand, we must continue to strictly guard the city gate. We must never let the princess out of this city. On the one hand, we must continue to find it, understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes! Yes! Yes ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, let me roll now, don't come back to see me without a princess!!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;A group of people hurriedly left the emperor's anger range. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Abominable!" The emperor punched the table after the other people left. "If you take it back, I will go to find a suitable person to marry you." Go out!!!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dike's capital is called Kemer, but people generally call it "the city of ice and snow." The reason why it has such a name is not because it is in the snow all year round, although the city is covered with ice and snow in two seasons in a year. The name comes from the fact that the entire city wall is made up of white stones and white, ice-like stones. The city of ice and snow was built in the early days of the Holy Light Dynasty, but until now its walls did not need to be refurbished. Everyone is rumored that this is because the Great Magister Shake himself has exerted powerful defensive magic on the walls. Now, this white city wall is not only the most powerful fortification in the city, but also the most attractive tourist attraction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The six people are strolling in the city surrounded by white walls, just this morning, Kim and other six people arrived in Kemer City, according to the plan, they must The sea area reached the Shark Harbor before the ice seal, but now there are at least two months away from the ocean ice seal (the sea near Shark Harbor is frozen from January to March), and they still have plenty of time. At the same time, because this fact is too dangerous, I can't come back when I go, so I have to enjoy it now, everyone decided to play well in this city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's beautiful", Kim involuntarily admired that the city's walls are not like artifacts that have existed for thousands of years, but just built. New product. Other people also sent the same sigh. Many of the buildings in this city are the same as its walls, and they were built at the same time as the city. Other buildings in the city want to imitate their elders, but they will still be recognized at a glance - similar styles, but the materials are too far apart. I really don't know where the ancient magicians got these white stones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get out of the way, bad old man, don't bother here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man was pushed outside the door, and one stood down and fell below the steps, in others When there was no action, Kim and Babe walked over and two people helped the old man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This old man seems to be quite old, he has a white hair and a beard, although he can’t say that he is wrinkled, but the wrinkles are already in him. The face occupies a large space, and the old man’s face is only a little beautiful. The old man’s dress was also very shabby. He wore a pointed hat that he didn’t know who was thrown away. He wore a worn wizard’s robes that could only be described as “poor”. He had a wooden hand on his hand. Rod, but that is also a junk that doesn't know which garbage dump it came from. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Grandpa, are you okay?" Babe said politely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Be careful," the man who pushed the old man out of the door and said to them loudly, "Don't ignore this old man, or he will get entangled in cheating." Compassion should not be placed on this old and unrepaired."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are too much, how can you treat an old man like this! Also say this. "Gold is a little angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people in the Adventurer’s Union sneered and turned around and went back inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden help the old man to correct his hat (although this hat is not the same as this hat), the old man rubbed the dust on his clothes with his hand. Lev was very suspicious of the necessity of this action - the dress did not become dirty because it fell to the ground, it has become impossible to become more dirty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man looked at the young magician in front of him and said, "Thank you, compassionate young man, this year, people like you can be true." It’s rare.” The old man went on to say, “Oh, old, no use, no one can afford me!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will Kim and Babe want to leave At the time, the old man stopped him "Young, I think, you will be happy to buy a poor old man to buy a glass of warm clothes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold sits across the old man who claims to be Locke, his companions are sitting next to a table. He watched the old man drink the fifth bottle of wine and then showed a satisfied expression. He began to believe that the words of the adventurer's union were correct. The old man claimed to be a magician (Gold was the first to hear about the magician and "Once"), but he was fired after studying in the School of Magic for a year, but in order to commemorate the days, he always wears magic. Master robe (I am afraid it is convenient for him to lie to eat and lie). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A second bottle of wine!" Locke said loudly to the pub's hospitality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pub's hostess came over and put a bottle of wine on the table without saying a word. Since the old man appeared in the city a year ago, she is no longer I remember that this bad old man used the sympathy of others to drink here for the first time. She was already tired of this old man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Locke stood up with a drink, he had eight empty bottles on the table. Kim and his friends followed the old man out of the tavern. Just as they were leaving, Locke stopped living in gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Young magician, you are such a good person" Old Locke made a full meal, "However, I hope you can do good people, you see, my body The clothes are so dirty, can you give me some gold coins so that I can buy new clothes?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold out ten gold coins from his pocket, he is now Just want to get rid of this bad old man earlier, he has already learned the lesson and decided not to deal with such people in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the old man left with a sly pace, everyone knows that this drunk will use these ten gold coins to drink, and suddenly he feels stupid. It was actually a blackmail by a bad old man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Forget it, don't care!" Lev saw the heart of Kim and came over to comfort him. "Now you have seen more people, these Money should be used as a tuition fee to learn a lesson."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone turned back to think of the hotel, and was disturbed by the old man, and even the fun of the game was gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, everyone decided to go to the military field outside the city, because there is a place where the legendary light held a military parade. Although there is no official record, in the folklore, the Holy Light* magic is after the army defeats the half-orc. There was a grand military parade there. Although it is just a folklore, it is enough to make it a tourist spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold is the only person who refuses to go because he has something else to tell the truth, if the magician who arrives in the city of ice and snow does not see it, Raymond Sordo, the title of the mainland's first magician, isn't that stupid? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the companions left, Kim set off. It’s a very simple matter to find the address of Raymond Sordo. Just ask a local person to know the answer. Kim notices the reverence of the face when the locals talk about the magician. Obviously, this big magician is very respected in Dicco. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The third house on the east side of the 'Noble Street' on the left side of the Imperial City." Kim said on his own side while walking on the aristocratic street. It is the residential area of ​​the aristocrats, and each house is so large that there are only a handful of gates throughout the street. "Come on!" Kim immediately recognized the home of Raymond Sordo. This door is really different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this is a door, it is seamless with the wall, and it is not visible at all - if it is not specifically made into the shape of the door . If you didn't know that you lived a big magician here, anyone would mistakenly think that the guy who had enough to do nothing had carved a door shape on the wall. The magical atmosphere of the door, the powerful magical atmosphere, all of which reminds Kim of the stone tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold is sure that this is the door to the Raymond Sordo residence. He stepped forward and first tidy up his clothes and then began to knock on the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Someone?" The stone door knocked on and made a very dull sound. This sound would never come out ten steps away, but from the outside size of the house. Speaking, the courtyard outside is going to take a hundred steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person who walked by the side of the road looked at the magician with a very surprised look - someone was knocking outside the house of Raymond Sordo The door is really ridiculous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold did not notice a pair of ridiculous eyes behind him, he was still waiting for the reaction of the inside, until a hand rested on his shoulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's you!" Kim turned his body, and it was the old man Locke yesterday. This old man has changed an old magician robe, although not very good, but much better than yesterday. Old Locke looked at him with a smile on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's the matter?" Jin Xinli really doesn't have much affection for the old man, but he is quite polite. "The old man, I am having something now, afterwards. Please drink the bar again!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you want to visit Raymond Sordo?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!" Kim answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why are you knocking on the door?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Locke saw the incomprehensible expression on the golden face and laughed. “Don't you ever hear about it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“What have you heard?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Raymond Sordo made this door of magic because he hated strangers visiting the house. There are only two ways to get in. One is to know the special charm of opening the door, and the other is to use magic to move the door. No. But if he is not close to him, he will not know the curse. Without the level of the great magician, he will not be able to move the door."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I climbed the wall!” Kim said to himself, his voice was very light, but he did not think that the old man’s ears were more sensitive than the young. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Young people, don't have the intention of climbing the wall, you have to know that this is the home of the big magician, who knows what defensive magic is there. Young people! "Old Locke looked at the dress of Kim’s trainee magician. "Go back and practice magic. When you become a great magician, come back to Raymond Sordo."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The old man looked at gold with a strange look. "Use the moving magic to lift the door up. I saw a magician doing this to open the door. However, the young man is impossible to succeed with the power of the trainee."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold turned around and muttered the mantra "The power hidden in the heavens and the earth, I am here to liberate you, under my constraints." Kim knows the prohibition on this door. Very powerful, he used all the power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door began to react. In the face of the magic of gold, it was finally conquered and began to move up little by little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Locke behind the golden body (since he called himself, we call him that too) exclaimed, "Great, young, your level Absolutely not a trainer's magician level. If you go to the magician's promotion exam, you can pass it. No, the Grand Master's promotion exam can also pass!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Kim did not answer, he has no way to answer, he must use all the attention to maintain such a large magic output (Gold uses a very common technique "magic overlap" here. If a magician When you need to use the power that a single spell can't release, he can achieve his goal by repeatedly reading the same mantra. For example, the door that Kim is holding up now cannot be lifted by a mobile technique, so he You must recite the mantra repeatedly, and use multiple movements to achieve his purpose. Of course, the magic power of multiple spells will multiply). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is slowly rising, it can already make people bend down and enter, but Kim does not dare to stop the magic, he is afraid that the door that will open easily will be in him. After stopping the magic, it will fall. Behind him, in addition to the old Locke, there have been many people around, and it is not a daily thing to see a magician entering the house of Raymond Sordo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a "refueling" sound in the crowd, they are encouraging this young magician, because no one has forcibly opened the door with magic for a long time, especially It is a young man who looks like a trainee magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold is now pleased, in the adventures of these months, his magic has improved a lot, he just came out of the stone tower The level, he is now out of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the magic of gold could not support it, the door was finally opened, and Kim sighed and stopped the magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door does not fall, it will stay in this state for a while. Kim turned back and the crowd was full of marvel at his youthful and powerful voice (who sounds very useful). Old Locke looked at him with amazement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You...you have such power, why is it just a trainee magician? Don't you go to the magician's grade test? (Old Locke The surprise is justified. The improvement of the level of the magician means that the status is improved and the new magical opportunity is increased. There is almost no magician to miss it. And it is worth wondering that the age of gold has the same power as the great magician. .)"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold bitterly laughed, the magician's level test is not a three-day activity, every five years will be in the magician college One such exam. If Kim wants to upgrade, he has to wait two years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go in!" A voice came from the crowd, and then more of the same words came in, "Go in, go in!" Everyone said so Even the old Locke is the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This house is bigger than it looks outside, and Kim wants to go while thinking . There is really a home of a magician. In addition to the cleanliness and elegance of the building, there are many magic spells on the ground and on the walls. A lot of gold has been seen in the Stone Tower, but there are also a lot of magical graphics gold that I don't know at all. However, the people who live here will never be a lot. Kim has gone to ten minutes and has not touched a living person. This is normal. The magicians who do research like to be clean and unwilling to be disturbed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold turned over a corridor, and there was a room full of powerful magical energy in front. Kim walked over, the door of the room was wide open, and there was no space inside. Things, only a complex magical map on the ground (in addition to using magic to draw magical arrays, you can also use magical items - such as stones - to form a magical array). Kim has never seen such a complicated magical array in his life. This magical array is first engraved with a magical array on the ground, and then a magical crystal powder is added to the groove. Numerous symbols and words that make gold cannot be meaningful. It seems that the chaos is built on a magical pentagram, but the powerful power from it shows that they are definitely not indiscriminate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of the people coming in front, although it is not clear, is enough to make the gold that is lost in the direction. Kim walked quickly to the source of the sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the distance approaches, the sound becomes clearer and more legible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher, let me try, beg you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, I I can't do this. I haven't studied this magic yet and can't make you take risks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why did you let me try this magic array last time?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's because I mistakenly thought that I had already understood it, but then I found out that I was wrong. This magic is still incomplete. You should know no. How dangerous is the complete magic, how lucky are you last successful? Do you know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But, teacher..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know the thoughts in your heart, since the last time this magic can greatly enhance your magic, this time will be the same. Remember, this magic is very dangerous, You can give you powerful magic and send you to the West. From the incomplete information in my hands, even in ancient times, the "magic increase" is not a complete one. Law, the success rate at that time was two-thirds, and the failure of the magician was only a dead end. Not to mention that I did not even reach the ancient level of research."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"But..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know your mood, it is really embarrassing to be beaten by the old classmates in the ring. However, you You must know that his magic is also earned by his hard work and hard work. As long as you practice hard, you will definitely overcome him. Don't think about using this incomplete magic. This magic is exchanged for magic at the cost of life. You are still young. It’s not worth taking the risk, or go back and practice well.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the sounds of Jin Yue’s hearing is familiar, he walks to the door of the room where the sound is heard. The people inside are going out, and the two people just happened to meet together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not that the family doesn’t get together, it’s the one that Kim doesn’t want to touch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 05<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breiter has taken a few steps back and forth, gold is the same, both people I did not expect to meet here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who!" In the ear of Kim, the old and majestic voice was heard. An old magician appeared next to Brett. He wore a rather expensive wizard's robe, and his body exudes a sense of pressure. The old man reached out and held the cloth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher, he...he is that...the..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;金心里It is clear that the old magician in front of him is the great magician Raymond Sordo who has the title of the first magician in the mainland, and is also the teacher of Brett. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without Brett, Raymond Sordo knows who the young man is, and he already knows this young man from the mouth of the apprentices. The power, if it is the door he opened, is not at all surprising. I did not expect this young man to come to visit him so soon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are gold? My apprentices have mentioned you to me, saying that you are the leader of the younger generation of magicians, a promising Young people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!" Kim replied, he regretted a bit (although he was very pleased to hear Raymond’s compliment), he did not expect Brette Here, if you know this early, he will go to the military field with his friends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright stood beside Raymond Sordo, he looked at gold with resentful eyes, but in front of the teacher, he did not dare to do it, and Even if he starts, he may not be able to beat gold. "Okay, go back first!" Raymond knew that there was a lot of dissatisfaction between this disciple and Kim. He called to leave. When Brett left, he licked the gold with a fierce look. Of course, he did not see it to his teacher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Welcome, young magician, come in and sit!" Raymond made a very standard welcome to Kim after Breit left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha," Raymond gave a very hearty smile. "I welcome every magician who can come in from the gate with his own strength. This is the purpose of my door. Sorry, I didn't come out to welcome you, because Brette has something to do with me. I heard that you and Brett are classmates of the School of Magic?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!" Kim licked his dry lips. "However, our relationship is not good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big magician told Jin to enter the room and said, "Bright is a talented student, but the heart is brave." It’s too narrow, it’s a good vengeance, but although it’s not a good character, it can provide power for his magical cultivation. Not to mention him, what is your visit to visit this time?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I...I..." To be honest, in the face of such an old man with a sense of dignity, Kim has forgotten all the problems he had discussed. It’s net. "I just want to see the mainland's first magician himself." He finally came up with an answer that was not answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the first magician in the mainland, this is everyone who lifts me up. It’s not the result of a big contest by the magician who lost the whole continent. I can't match the title. I am just an old man who likes to do magic research. I am not different from others, just a human being."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Raymond Sir!" After sitting down, Kim finally asked the question he most wanted to know. "How did you become a big magician?" He once asked the question of Xiu Ke, but his teacher always had the same answer. "Continuous learning, hard practice, perseverance, three points." The talent plus seven points of hard training, and finally will become the big magician." But Kim can not be satisfied with this answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big magister smiled. He suddenly asked "Young people, do you know what a big magister?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This...the big magician is the most powerful magician!" Kim felt the problem was strange, but he answered it according to his own understanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why can the big magician have the most powerful magic? The magician becomes a great magician is a gradual process, the great magician becomes a priest and also a The slow process, only the big magician is a short time, the power of the big magician is not slowly improved by repeated practice, I am also known as the great magician before I know that I already have such powerful magic. Do you know why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Kim understands that he wants to know the answer he most wants to know. He listens to Raymond’s words. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Young man, I use a metaphor to describe, if a cart wants to pull the car fast, what should he do? Obviously, It’s just to exercise more and make yourself more energetic so that you can pull faster.” Raymond smiled and looked at Kim’s confused look. “But there is another way to put a horse on the car and come by yourself. Drive now. Now you understand, the so-called big magician is the magician who turns himself from the carter into the driver."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That, how? Can you be a driver?" The answer to his day and night is in front of him, and Kim’s excited body is shaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond laughed. "It’s very simple, exercise hard until you have the ability to catch a horse. Young people, there is no shortcut to magic. If you go to a certain stage, you will naturally know how to become a big magician."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah!" Kim feels disappointed, this answer There is no essential difference between the answer to Xiu Ke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right," Kim suddenly thought of the conversation between Brett and Raymond. "I know that eavesdropping on someone else’s conversation is wrong, but I just heard you. Speaking of "magic increase", this magic seems to have been heard from my teacher."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You say the magic increase," said the Magister. "That is probably the only shortcut to enhance the magic. I found information about this magic in the ruins of a sacred dynasty. This magic was invented by ancient magicians to enhance the magic in a short time, but it has never been Not a complete magic, although in theory it can give the magician decades to gain power, but for all kinds of unknown reasons, its success rate is only two-thirds. If this magic fails, the subject is The person will be sucked away from the flesh and blood and become a corpse. This is to gamble with your own life!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
