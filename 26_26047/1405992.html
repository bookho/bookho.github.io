			<div id="content">Wei walked on the empty street, he was going to find a new prey, but now he is following a troublesome little devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go slow, Big Brother, I can't walk anymore!" The teenager's feet are already very tired. He just fled under the chase of the Orcs and made him tired. It’s almost impossible to start. But the warrior in front of him is still advancing at his speed, and he does not care for himself. The young man only follows him. This is the way to live in this place. If he encounters a half-orc again, his death will be fixed. Originally, I wanted to take advantage of the fact that the half-orcs were not prepared to escape from the encirclement. I didn’t expect the half-orcs to be everywhere. I just gave up my life. But this warrior must be very strong. He dared to wander around this place. It must have absolute certainty to leave the city. He must be right with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a bloody taste in front, it is very attractive, Wei immediately went in that direction. The boy is behind him. It’s strange that I can tell the humans and the half-orcs. Why is it that I can keep the state of the Berserker in my body and keep my mind clear? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a bloody scene in front of two people (Wei was very useful, but the boy was very scared), a group tried to escape from the gap surrounded by the half-orcs Humans have been caught by dozens of half-orcs. The Orcs have killed the bodyguards in this refugee rank, and now they are screaming in the scary and trembling humans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s really fat!" A half-orc grabbed a big fat man who was only walking on two feet with the pig. "It seems that you have a lot of oil." My weapon just needs oil to lubricate it!" The urine that scared the big fat man also flowed out, and the half-orcs felt very happy. This is why they didn't kill these humans. They looked at others and feared it. It is a pleasure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, don’t kill all of them, Greg said, this time, try to catch as many prisoners as possible, so that those mines will have enough slaves. "Children and the elderly can be killed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassure, can this pig work? It doesn't matter if you kill him!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the Orcs did not plan to kill all humans. Compared with humans, they are more inclined to enslave other races than to destroy other races (the half-orcs are definitely not a very hard-working race, on the contrary, they are lazy). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A murderous murder came, all the half-orcs and humans felt it. They looked up and looked at the human warrior and his man wearing full body armor not far away. A boy who is timid behind him. Wei’s armor and sword were already full of blood, and his whole body looked bright red, adding to the horror color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Wei’s murderousness is not as strong as before (of course, restoring reason), and the half-orcs don’t know that it’s a deadly comet that they put Wei Dang became a deserter who escaped from the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Kill him!" As a half-orc called, then a few orcs rushed over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Big Brother, run away!" The teenager shouted, although the warrior was very brave, but the half-orc in front of him is definitely no less than fifty! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-orc's body splits in Wei's Jianguang, broken, and the new blood remains on Wei's armor and demon sword. Seeing this scene, all the half-orcs rushed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the bloody dance, the half-orc changed from a desperate attack to a desperate escape, but none of them could escape their lives under Wei’s sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weiss did not pay attention to this group of people, this should be a team of rich people to escape, although they want Wei to protect them, but for Wei, It’s already good to not kill them. He left them after killing all the half-orcs, but the boy is still following him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s really unbelievable, there are such brave warriors in the world! One can kill dozens of half-orcs who are known for their fierceness! The teenager looked at the soldier who continued to move forward with the feeling of worship. He is the strongest warrior he has ever seen. Although he has no expression on his face, he is really handsome. The so-called "power and beauty in one body" means this person! And he is still saving the refugees in the chaos. It is a hero in the hero (misunderstanding). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold is very strange, how can he save the city by himself? ? He is just an ordinary magician. Moreover, if you want to save the city by yourself, even the big magician can't do it. There are at least 200,000 enemies. What is the use of one person relative to this number? But Old Locke seems to be sure that he can save the city and defeat the 200,000 orcs. In fact, the strangest thing about gold is that if the old Locke can let him defeat the half-orc, then why should he do it, and the old Locke himself can do it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is this a magical array?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, now you have to make a magical array according to this graphic!" Old Locke's words have a commanding tone. There is a power that obeys everyone, and the beginning of Jin Yu builds a magical array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A complex and complex magical array, gold releases magical energy, and it took him ten minutes to complete this magical array. When the figure consisting of glowing white magical energy appears in front of gold, there is no power to send out, and gold has a feeling of being fooled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this magical array?" Kim couldn't help but ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now concentrate on the power of Raytheon!" Old Locke did not answer the question of Kim, he gave the next instruction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold closes his eyes (for better concentration) and begins to meditate on the prayers. Soon, the power of Raytheon is full of his body, he opens his eyes . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now I am following the manuscript, I am reading, you are following one!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I...in the darkness, calling for the elves of light to come..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I...in the darkness, calling the elves of light to come... ..." Kim followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...All powerful forces are in the hands of the gods in charge of them..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "...all powerful powers are in the hands of the gods who are in charge of them..." How have these spells ever been heard? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...With all your strength, smash all the darkness of the world..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" ... with all your strength to smash all the darkness in the world..." It's really a strange spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Thunder bounds open"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Thunder bounds open"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold’s hand emits a thunderbolt that powers an ant to death. The grotesque curse can also exert this level of energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the magic array that was just made has reacted, and the magic array absorbs the energy of the lightning and starts to work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just like being born out of nothingness, the sky that just happened was changed in a blink of an eye, and the dark clouds (this time is not a griffin) are gathered from all sides. The sky becomes dark and the typical thunderstorm precursors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gerle look at the sky, it seems that God is also helping, as long as heavy rain Once, the fire wall will soon lose its effect. He immediately made a gesture, and all the Orc warriors knew that the decisive battle was about to begin. They all clung to their weapons and intended to give humans a final blow. Geller rides the beast and fights back and forth before the battle, inspiring the half-orc soldiers. Although the victory is unquestionable, the final resistance of mankind will be extremely tenacious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opposite of the fire wall, the Czech Republic is also ready. Since the fall of the city has not changed, at least enough people can escape. Once the fire wall is extinguished, the Czech Republic will lead a force to drag the enemy's main force. Other troops and some citizens will break out from one side. Although they don't know how many people can escape, they can go one. The Czechs did not know that the terrible rhinoceros heavy cavalry was waiting outside the city, and Geller would not let any human escape from his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behan looked out, "It seems to be raining!" A few are thinking about how to escape from this city that has no hope, although the best way is to pass the dark road, but how to get there without being discovered by the half-orcs is a big problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s raining? It’s a bad thing.” Lev had hoped that the battle would be dragged to the dark, so that the opportunity would be much bigger. But if it rains, the fire wall will soon lose its effect, and the battle may soon end. Once the Orcs begin to search the city, they are unlikely to be spared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Right, will that fat uncle have something?" Babe asked, the fat uncle just risked his life and went out to find his young master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone did not answer, everyone knows that this out is a lot less. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei Jianjian cut down a half-orc, he can’t remember himself How many orcs have been killed, but the desire for blood in my heart has not diminished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah..." came a scream behind him, and the boy was attacked by a half-orc. Wei turned his body and saw that a half-orc who had cut a hand by him was waving his sword with his remaining hand to the little devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the fighter can’t be killed, it’s enough to kill this little devil. The half-orc rushed to the boy with this kind of thought, but Wei rushed at the speed of almost illusion, and a sword broke his fantasy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s weird, why should you save this nasty kid? He has been arguing behind him just now. It is very good to not give him a sword. Why should he save him? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 02<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teenager looked at Wei with gratitude, this seemingly indifferent warrior In fact, I still pay attention to him. Although he has never answered him a word (Wei is dumb!), but he does not care about him. To be honest, it is really lucky to meet him. If this man appears in the court, then all the ladies will be around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why save this little devil? This little ghost like a fly is quite annoying, but the cry of his "big brother, big brother" can remind him of his younger brother and sister. Before, they will be wrapped around their own side. "Brother, brother" is always on the go. . Probably overlap him and his younger siblings? Wei said to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Wei was thinking, a half-orc pierced by a sword sneaked up and he waved his warham to Wei behind Wei. . If he is not seriously injured, then Wei must be able to hear the sound of a broken weapon. If Wei is not thinking, his instincts will tell him that danger will come. But now the half-orc wielding the hammer's hand is very weak (the warhammer is very heavy, very weak and can be deadly), and before the discovery of Wei, the warhammer fell on his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A heavy blow came from the back of the head, and a huge impact hit Wei’s helmet (fortunately, the whole body was attached to the helmet). Wei felt his eyes black and black. He fell forward and fell to the teenager's feet. (The Orcs inadvertently made the right attack, only the head is the weakness of the Berserker)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-orc who succeeded in sneak attack could not support it, he also Followed by falling to the ground, Wei stayed on him with a very heavy injury. The activity just made the injury worse, and his soul fell into the arms of Pluto. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Big Brother, are you okay?" The teenager hurried down to check Wei's injury. He held Wei's head up and looked at Wei's motionlessness. He was really frightened without medical common sense. This is the end of the next, it is his own fault, if his attention is not transferred by himself, then it is absolutely impossible to see the sneak attack. It seems that the words of those guys have been verified, and they may be really a bad person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Big Brother, talk!" The boy shook Wei's head anxiously. He suddenly regretted why he was so capricious to play in this city. Why did you want to attract the attention of this warrior? Why do you clearly escape and deliberately scream so that the warrior can save himself? If it weren't for him, then this warrior would never die (he thought Wei was dead). With remorse, the teenager cried out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei opened my eyes, although this shot is quite heavy, but with the protection of the helmet, it will not be his life. He is now a Berserker, and the pain is not felt at all. As soon as the impact is over, he can wake up immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hot liquid fell on his face, Wei opened his eyes and saw a face full of tears, and a clear sob in his ear. He is crying, why? Is it for yourself? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Big Brother, are you okay?" Seeing Wei's eyes open, the teenager was overjoyed. "Of course there is nothing! I am not so easy to die!" Wei Benyi wanted to say in sign language (from here I can see that Wei is very fond of this boy), but he suddenly found that his hand could not be lifted, just now The power that filled his body has disappeared, and Wei has recovered from the state of the Berserker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no difference between Wei and Yu. He can't move now. If there is a half-orc at this time, he will definitely become a great warrior whom all half-orcs admire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold's heart is full of doubts. The magic array is a spell made up of magical energy. As long as the formation is completed, it will immediately work. The magic array only needs to consume magic when it is constructed. As long as it is not destroyed after construction, it is equal to a perpetual inscription (and does not consume magic). All this is the common sense of magic! But now this has become a paradox. Kim looked at the old Locke with a puzzled look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't be surprised, young people, this is a curse, it can't be judged by common sense!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Forbidden? This is the curse, the legendary horror magic that is not allowed to use? What is the direct cause of the demise of the Holy Light Dynasty? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is clouded and lightning is on. But the lightning did not fall down, all the electric light gathered in midair, turned into a huge lightning ball, and the ball is getting bigger and bigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the power of the curse? Kim carefully understands the changes in the atmosphere with his own feelings. The original insignificant magic is constantly absorbing other forces to strengthen himself. It has now turned from a bug into a huge behemoth, and still The expansion of the end. Kim has never seen magic to proliferate itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When watching the lightning in the sky join the huge lightning ball, Kim suddenly felt very scared. He never heard of a lightning bolt. Manipulating the lightning in nature, the so-called lightning magic is actually the energy of lightning from the hands of the magician (power can not be compared with the natural lightning). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What should I do?" Kim asked Old Locke for his fearful voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hurry up and ask the god of nothingness to control this magic!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can control this magic? Can you control this horrible energy? Although Kim was very suspicious, he did it according to the words of Old Locke. He began to meditate on the prayers that demanded power from the God of Nothingness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two armies at the ends of the fire wall looked up at the terrible sky, one The huge lightning energy began to brew in the sky above the city, and this force made everyone feel scared. Neither humans nor half-orcs know what is going to happen, and those of them who are sincere believe that the punishment will come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a house, four people are looking at the sky through the window Their faces are all white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the lightning ball falls, the city will soon disappear in the world!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not an alarmist, the thunderbolt is constantly absorbing lightning and becoming more and more huge. If it falls, no life can be spared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Big Brother, let’s find a place to hide, and soon there will be The other half-orcs came!" The young man tried hard to support Wei, but this body with full body armor is too heavy! Only after a dozen meters, the teenager could not move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You go, don't worry about me!" Wei tried to sign a sign to the teenager, but his hanging hand couldn't lift it, let alone gestures. . At this time, screams and footsteps came from behind. It’s a half-orc, and a group of half-orcs are coming! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What to do, if you leave yourself, then he will be able to find a place to hide in time. Wei used all his strength to raise his head (poor) and told the boy with his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no way!" The young man said this while putting Wei on the side of the road, he ran away alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is right!" Wei Xinli thought, he really did not want this young man to accompany him to die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A stack, another stack, Wei's body was finally covered with straw, but the boy did not have time to escape, the half-orcs had come over, they found the man who was planning to escape. They immediately chased it and it was easy to catch the exhausted child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We clearly heard the screams of the half-orcs and the screams of the teenagers in the straw, and then the footsteps slowly left. Looking at the visions in the sky, the Orcs were also very flustered. They were rushing to plunder, and then sent the spoils to the military camp outside the city, not even noticed the strange pile of straw on the side of the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold is now in extreme pain, he is trying to work hard with all his strength Control that huge amount of energy. The god of nothingness responded to his call and gave him strength, but for Kim, controlling this power is a little higher than his ability. The whole body is like a fire, burning and numb to the ice, every cell is suffering, this feeling is simply hell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Young people, hold on, if you can't control this curse, then the city, including you and me, will be finished!" Old Locke loudly Give up the gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I really want to give up, even if it is dead, it is better than this! However, in the mind of Kim, the scene of the former village of Noor appeared. This time, it is no longer possible to repeat the same mistakes. When he thinks about the past, he has the courage to persevere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For the partners, you must also support it!" Kim is biting his teeth and working hard (in fact, controlling the curse does not require so much power, but Kim does not experience). If the lightning ball falls, the city becomes a historical term. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s finally succeeded, although it’s not completely controlled, but gold can finally partially control the energy that can’t be described by terror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the city, the power of the fire wall begins to decrease, no matter how much fuel When there is exhaustion, although people don't know what the lightning ball on the head is, the most important thing is to break through. Opposite them, the Orcs also put aside the threat on their heads, and the fire wall was not enough to form an insurmountable line of defense. The final battle came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 03<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire wall has now weakened a lot, and the heat wave is not so strong. Some half-orcs began to pour water on the fire wall (now accessible), speeding up the extinguishing of the flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, the two armies across the fire wall can see each other. No one is talking, everyone is quietly waiting for the flame to be completely extinguished (but it will take a while to completely extinguish). But they ignore the top of the head is a mistake, and now the lightning ball has changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The part of the lightning ball was separated, and the death of a whole squadron was killed in the battle of someone who drove the mind to the half-orc. The entire half-orc queue was turbulent for this accident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold’s gasp in the big mouth, he has tried his best to control it, but he can barely let it fall to the half-orc’s queue. Precise control of the placement. Although it caused confusion to the Orcs, he knew that the blow was not enough to shake the Orcs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another piece of lightning was separated from the thunderbolt and slammed into the queue of the Orcs. This time it happened that the drop was at the side of Geller. The young King of Tooth just managed to control the riots. He also began to pay attention to the things above his head. He saw how the lightning ball was controlled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God of Warrihart, guard your people!" Greg saw thunder and lightning, he did not escape with the beast - if he If you escape, the Guards around him can't run away either - but the hammer of the god of war in the high-lifted hand shouts loudly to the god he admires. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God of War feels his will, powerful power comes to the hammer of the god of war and his holder, the hammer of the god of war sends a beam of light toward the road The thunderbolt greeted, and the two forces collided in the air, giving off a dazzling light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold was forced by this light to open his eyes. After he opened his eyes, the thunder and the light column had disappeared. It seems that the two forces offset each other. He was trying to find out where the light beam came from, but the sound of the old Locke sounded in his ear. "Don't stop, the flame will disappear. This is the last chance!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thunderbolt fell together, although the gold could not control the precise landing point, but most of the lightning still fell into the half-orc, and the rest fell to the open space, and none fell on the human head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All people can see that this lightning ball is controlled. If someone in Dike can use such powerful magic, then there is only one person. - Grand Magister Raymond Sordo! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reinforcements are coming, Dick’s magician corps is coming! All humans (including the Czech generals) think so. The breakout plan was immediately cancelled and turned into a counterattack plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, the half-orc is in chaos, the thunder of death keeps falling on the head of the half-orc, and the half-orcs who died under the lightning have gone from a few hundred liters. To a few thousand, even an honorary warrior can't resist this level of lightning, although thousands of casualties are nothing to the half-orc army. (Gold's control is limited, only one thunder can be controlled at a time, and a thunderbolt is also Only dozens of half-orcs can be killed.) But the confusion and panic caused by the half-orcs is very strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gerler is powerless, although the hammer of the god of war can protect him, but it is impossible to protect the soldiers. He was red-eyed looking for the one who controlled the lightning ball, and the other half-orcs were the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;finally found, just on the wall! The Orcs and humans clearly saw a magician standing on the wall, although it was too far away to see clearly, but it must be that he was not wrong. His body is surrounded by strange brilliance, and powerful energy is radiated from his body. As soon as he waved his hand, a thunderbolt immediately separated from the huge lightning ball and landed on the head of the half-orc. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s him, hurry up and kill the magician! Without a command, a group of half-orcs rushed to the wall. Kim saw a group of half-orcs rushing to himself, and he felt very flustered. The half-orcs are getting closer, and Kim can't think of any way to deal with them (controlling this magic has exhausted all his power, he can no longer distract). In panic, his control of the curse Weakened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty lightnings fall from the sky, hit the city, the control of the uncontrollable curse exerts terrible power, in a blink of an eye, dozens of houses In order to fly smoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Orcs want to rush to kill this magician, now the body of gold is surrounded by terrible power, the closer it is, the stronger the lightning attack . The Orcs soon knew that it was impossible to attack this magician. Kim also found that half-orcs can not only come over, but even impossible to walk under the wall. He immediately understood that the power of the curse was now surrounded by himself, and he immediately gained control of the curse (not fully controlled). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greg knows that if he can't kill this powerful magician, he can't take down Hope City. He immediately rides the beast, using the fastest speed. Come to Jin Chong. As long as there is a hammer of the god of war in his hand, he has the confidence to fight against any enemy, even this terrible magician is no exception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Locke looked at Greg, who was constantly moving closer with an instant. Only he seemed to be immune to lightning, and he had no relationship with Kim. "This half-orc kid really doesn't know how to live and die. Don't he know the power limit of the God of War? Or does he still know the full power of the hammer of the god of war?" Old Locke said to himself, his voice is very big, But now that Kim has been concentrating on controlling the curse, he has not paid attention to what Old Locke is saying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thunder and lightning around the body is getting stronger and stronger, but the hammer of the god of war in the hand releases an energy protection field to protect the body of Geller. Just as he thought, the Quake Hammer can protect its holders. Now just get close to the magician. Because the air is full of frenzied energy flow, the beast has been unable to move instantly, it can only run over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Greer doesn’t know much about the power of the weapon in his hand, presumably because he has never fully exerted its power since he got the hammer of the god of war. opportunity. If the hammer of the god of war has endless power, then the king of the last tooth will not die in the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gerley rushed under the wall, he knew that it was not right, and the feeling of the hammer of the god of war in his hand clearly told him that it could not continue to resist this. The power of the air. Finished, if the protection field disappears, then this is his place of burial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the moment of crisis, Gölcher couldn’t care to kill the magician, and hammered it on the mount, the painful beast was desperate. Use instant movement - although it does not control the destination in this energy net. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's over!" Geller hated his thoughts. Now his army has completely fallen into chaos. The panic caused by thunder and lightning has completely lost the order of the Orcs. Human beings are now in the enthusiasm of the arrival of the reinforcements. If you go on, you can only cause more casualties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this time there was no plan to capture this city, this time it was just an exercise to check the combat effectiveness of the mad beasts and to use victory to consolidate him. Status and prestige. The real battle has not yet begun, and the mad beasts have only three components (rhinocero cavalry, wolf cavalry, honorary warriors, and gryphon cavalry are not well trained), and there are opportunities in the future. But the complete victory that is about to be sneaked away in the hands is really unwilling! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gerler suppressed his heart and he gave orders to retreat. This lightning ball is only over the city of Hope. As long as it is out of town, it should be fine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orcs are evacuated from Hope City like the tides, and humans cannot pursue them because of the blockage of the fire wall. In addition to the gold that caused several lightning strikes on the head of the half-orc in the retreat, the Orcs had no other losses. Seeing more and more half-orcs outside the city, Kim couldn't help but want to attack them with lightning, but Old Locke stopped him: "Young people, don't be impulsive, you still have no ability to completely control this squad, don't Do things you can't do, otherwise there will be accidents that you don't want to see."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold stopped the plan to strike the city outside, but now it has appeared again A new question, how can we make the lightning ball disappear from the top of the head? Now there are only human beings in the city. Can he always drop the lightning into the city? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greg knows that it is necessary to retreat as soon as possible (who knows if the thunder will extend to the suburbs?), the loose military discipline that he hated now brings meaning Unexpected results - the Orcs have gained a lot of spoils. Under the command of Geller, only half an hour later, the half-orcs along with their military camps and flags disappeared from the perspective of Old Locke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no way to support it anymore, the fire wall has weakened to the point where it can no longer threaten people (some places have been completely extinguished), but the lightning ball on the top of the head is still presence. People are watching this terrible energy, fearing that it will suddenly fall out of control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold is desperately trying to make the lightning ball not fall, but this can't make the huge energy of the lightning ball disappear, he is struggling, even There is no way to ask the old Locke how to get rid of this damn curse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Locke did not pay attention to gold, he has been watching the army of half-orcs, after he determined that the half-orc was completely retreating, he turned around and watched It’s time for gold that is already fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Young, what are you doing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What am I doing? The idiot also looked out, I was letting the damn curse not fall on the city! Don't talk nonsense, tell me how to make this huge lightning ball disappear? Unfortunately, I have been unable to speak, otherwise I will be called out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't stick to it, let this curse be awesome? By the way, you can see how terrible the curse is without control!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 04<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What! Let this lightning ball fall freely? Kim knows that the power of the lightning ball is now saturated. If it is not controlled, it will fall, and the city will be finished! What is the heart of old Locke? Does he want to destroy this city? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I’m exhausted and can’t continue to control the horrible power of this curse, even though I’m not willing, but the flesh still betrays the mind, with the limit When it arrived, Kim finally lost control of the squad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the dark clouds in the sky are no longer lightning, and the size of the lightning ball is also the largest. After losing any restraint, the huge lightning ball falls. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A loud bang, the lightning ball fell on the uncapable peak after Hope City (previously, Hope City is in the mountains Built), but with a blink of an eye, the mountain lost one-fifth of his volume and all the trees above it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the true power of the curse? Kim looked at this terrible scene. He rubbed his hand on the sweat on his head. The face was sticky and it looked like it. It was because he couldn’t bear the powerful magic. The capillaries on his hand had broken. Now, his hands are all blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the horror of the curse! The scene just now was repeated in the mind of Kim, what a terrible magic! This is a complete destruction of magic, which is born in the mind of what kind of madness and genius! When the mind is still in shock, a voice floats into the golden ear: "In all races, only humans use this magic to destroy the enemy together with themselves! We cast a sword with hatred, with Cruelty gathers into magic, and when it destroys others, it also pushes itself to the path of extinction. But this is humanity, and at the same time, the race is constructed with the two essences of sin and kindness. Young people, you remember, see all You must also see all the good at the same time. Otherwise, your strength will engulf you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold wants to look back at Old Locke, but the body The accumulation of fatigue in the brain came up, so that he could not even turn his neck. The god of nothingness gave him strength and deprived of physical strength and vitality from his body. Kim felt something in his throat. He began to spit out the stuff that was stuck in his throat. The smell that passed to his nose told him what it was—he was vomiting blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s an ordinary magician, he’s going to faint now, but Kim has a strong body that doesn’t belong to the magician’s profession, though he’s tired and Suffering in pain, but with his strong capital, he stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold sits on the wall, and now the dark clouds in the sky have completely dissipated, just as they appear suddenly, it is impossible to imagine the sound of thunder and lightning. . Kim looked up and saw several humans approaching him with care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several soldiers are approaching gold, this powerful magician is sitting on the ground now, he seems to have exhausted the magic, but anyway, It is better to be close to such a magician. If this magician is willing, then the city will disappear from the world. The officer of them spoke<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Respected magician...ah, no...respected great magister..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold looked around, Old Locke did not know when it had disappeared, and these soldiers apparently spoke to themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You...you just called me?" I didn't expect someone to call him a great magister, and Kim couldn't react - everyone else cursed this. Becoming his real power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To the right, the dear Master Magi, our commander sent us..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "I believe that you made a mistake, I am not a big magician, I am just a trainee magician..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We...wrong ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, that big magician has left!" This is not a lie, in the heart of Kim, he has regarded Old Locke as a big demon. Mentor - A person who studies such a curse is definitely not an ordinary magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faces of the soldiers immediately slackened. After all, it’s impossible to become a big magician after such a young age. This explanation is reasonable. Sitting on the ground. It was just an ordinary magician rescued by the Great Magister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you help me? I can't stand up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two soldiers The gold was given up, and Kim walked down the wall with their help. The officer kept asking Kim about the big magician, but Kim’s heart was completely occupied by other things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Great Magister! When will I really get this title? Right, who is Old Locke? He must be a hermit. Why did he want me to use this curse? Also, did he take us to the site, and let me and the god of nothingness deliberately make a contract? Or even knowing with us is pre-arranged? Is it... "Gold suddenly has a fever and the heart beats. "Does he want to accept me as a disciple? Then I am too lucky... impossible, even my teacher told me that although I work hard, my talent is just normal. ), a magician like this will never look at me..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not mentioning gold there, thinking about it, after seeing the half-orc evacuated, Under the command of the Czech general, mankind began to extinguish the fire and rescue the wounded. The casualties were very heavy. At least 70,000 people were taken by the Orcs in the city (plus the death of the war), and the destroyed property was countless, but with the help of the unknown big magister. Repelled the half-orc, otherwise, I can't imagine the consequences. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is happy with the safety of others. Because Elna is a therapist, she is now temporarily recruited by the army to treat the wounded. Everyone must stay in the city for a while (they really need time to recuperate). ). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Czech Republic immediately arranged all the things, and immediately let the Pegasus listen to the five cities (fortresses) nearby, but as expected, half The orcs have already captured the five cities with the airborne of the Griffin. According to the survivors, the Orcs started the attack on Hope City after they captured the five cities. Fortunately, Hope City has not been lost, otherwise the vast and rich plains in the back will be threatened by the half-orcs all the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, the news reached the city of ice and snow, and Dicky knew the half-orc Offensive news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond Sordo returns home without any smile on his face . He is really not happy today. This morning, the king was furious at the meeting. The six northern cities were captured by the half-orcs, and the king won the news after the half-orcs retreated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You said, what is this? The Czech general said that he did send the emergency military situation to Wangcheng two weeks ago, but why do I know now? Raymond did not speak. He had a great responsibility for this matter. He was an important supporter of the Magic Corps withdrawing from the peaceful Hope City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We must have spies inside! I think it is strange that a guard is suddenly killed by the roof of the corrugated. Now I think the guard must have received a letter of assistance, that In order to prevent this from spreading, the murder of the guard! If it were not for the blessing of the gods, this time Dicco would be finished."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Raymond Sir, go back and ask your apprentice carefully. He was the first to arrive at the scene where the guard died. Ask him if there is something wrong at the time. We must catch the spy anyway!" Two things just happened to come together, but he only promised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why didn't you receive the letter? No man in the world will betray his compatriots for the half-orcs! It must be a deductive guy who forgot to report this important letter in time, and then he was afraid of being responsible, so he secretly disposed of the letter. This is a reasonable inference. Five cities in the north were broken, and nearly half a million people were killed and taken away, just because of such a damn dereliction of duty. But when I said that I couldn’t blame myself, I originally inferred that the half-orc’s civil war (the half-orcs didn’t have a south attack and a civil war) probably lasted for decades, which was a big mistake. I didn’t think of the legend. The hammer of the god of war was found again, and now the half-orcs will unite and become a huge threat to humanity. In the future, we must strengthen the military power of the North, and we must not relax in any way. However, speaking, who is that big magister? Judging from his magical description, he seems to use the curse called "Lei Bin", but this is impossible! The curse is uncontrollable, and the magician can obviously control that magic - is there a magic in the world that controls natural lightning? It seems that my knowledge is still very shallow! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the King’s judgment was not taken for granted, Raymond called Brette, his youngest apprentice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bright, you recall, the day you saw the unexpectedly killed guard, is there anything strange about the scene?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright’s face has changed a bit. Why does the teacher track down an accident that would never attract attention? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 05<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher, today...what happened today?" There is no positive answer from Leite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You still don't know? The Orcs invaded again and broke five of the six cities guarding the North. Fortunately, Hope City kept it, otherwise, Deco has another catastrophe!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hop City holds! That damn gold won't be so lucky to survive... half-orc The most hated is the magician..." Brett was a little panicked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But, teacher, what does this have to do with that accident?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher, is it possible that the letter was not sent at all..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Impossible! The adventurers who sent the letter later returned to Hope. City - there is the one who came last time, your classmate Jin! I heard that he also escaped this time..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright I can't hear the following words. When it's over, the gold is not dead. If he comes back, everything will be clear... What should I do... I can only find ways to kill him... But how do I get it? He killed it, he still has a group of friends... Yes, with poison... No, there is a therapist among his friends... Please killer... but this may be detected...<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond noticed that Brett was flustered, and with his many years of experience he immediately guessed a probable one - a protagonist that he would not even know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have any doubt that the death of the guard is a bit suspicious?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Having... ...no, really no..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then leave first!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Ok...good...teacher..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brett with anxiety and uneasiness and a little regret - remorse for his plans is too inconspicuous - - Turned around and planned to leave. But as soon as he turned his body, Raymond immediately began a "reading mind." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic clearly conveys the inner thoughts of Brett’s current chaos to Raymond’s heart, although it is very unwilling, but Raymond must face reality – though The King’s guess is not very correct, but it is indeed the director of Brett. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s really hateful, I didn’t think that my apprentice was like this, for a little bit of private hatred – in fact, this is not a deep hatred – in fact, not at all Counting hatred - even disregarding the security of the country. If the aid letter is sent in time, the magic corps can move in an instant (the magic squad's magician ranks high, the number is large, there is enough power to move instantly to those cities that are attacked) to the cities, maybe You can save more cities, but...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bright!" Raymond's tone is full of sternness and anger that is different from the previous one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher, what?" Brent turned his body, he saw his teacher full of anger, and - he was using a magic, from Inferred from the energy of his body, it is "reading the mind" - when it's over, everything is over, nothing can't hold it - when you think of the terrible power of the teacher and the punishment he might punish himself, Brett is all over the body. trembling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher, you listen to me..." When you say it, Brett discovers his stupidity. The teacher has already learned everything through mind reading. He can still Any explanation? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bu Lai Te, do you know what the crime is? You will be burned alive in the square, no one can save you!! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher..." When he thought that he would be burned to death, Brett’s line of defense collapsed and his legs were uncontrollable. Come down and ask Raymond for mercy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright took his simple baggage out of Raymond’s house. After he came out, the magic door fell immediately, and Raymond’s magic also played a role—the spell that opened the door completely disappeared from his mind—he had been ousted by Raymond Door, this house is no longer his residence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he is still wearing a magician gown, he is no longer a magician, he is nothing - Raymond added to him Some kind of bondage, he can never use magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frustration, remorse, and annoyance are full of Brett’s heart, but he should be thankful that Raymond was finally greeted by his pleading Impressed, he couldn't bear to send his disciples who had been with him for many years to the firearms (Dike's law, treason is to be fired), he just sealed the ability of Brett to use magic (this is actually quite cruel, It is better for some people to use magic than to kill him, but Brett is obviously not one of them, and he is driven out of the division. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sitting on the carriage leaving the city of ice and snow, Brett’s mood was dark, his desperate curse, cursing gold, cursing his damn companions, cursing Raymond who had spared his life, and cursing the country (that is Did not think of myself). But now he is just a useless waste, and his curse is nothing but an empty threat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What should I do now? Only go home! I have been back home several times in the past few years, and every time I go back to the wind, but now I have to go back in vain. Brett is not the eldest son, so he cannot inherit the status of the Marquis. At that time, his father (Brett was born in the home of a Marquis of the Reiter Empire) tried every means to buy the invigilator of the School of Magic, and he got the first place in the graduation exam to get the recommendation of the college to become Raymond Sordo. disciple. His father thought that his future was no problem (and later explained this), and now everything is over. Although Raymond can train him from a lame magician to a great magician, he can't change the essence of a narrow-minded villain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What will happen in the future? Brett almost dared not imagine, mixed with his father at home, and later lived by the big brother's charity? Is this the future of a once-respected great magician? No, it is not reconciled, but what can he do? He can now say that he has no skills, he will not do anything but magic, and his teacher's bondage is so powerful, unless there is a magician who is stronger than his teacher to help him - this is almost no Possibly, his teacher is the first magician in the mainland, and why is that powerful magician helping him? - His life is probably over, and it is destroyed in the hands of the damn victim, Kim Kali. (Author's Note: From here, when Breit is safe and will become this virtue immediately, it can be seen that Raymond's compassion is completely unnecessary, and Breit has no meaning of repentance.)<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician of the capital sent a large number of people and supplies with an instant move, and now this almost was destroyed The city has finally begun to recover. At the moment in Hope City, six adventurers are negotiating their luggage and are planning to leave. It can be said that it is a very lucky thing that no one died in this catastrophe, but at this moment, six people are not lucky for this, and they have a little bit of things in their hearts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold: What is the exciting name of the Great Magister! If that name really means how good it is! Unfortunately, I really can't match this title now! Old Locke must have a deep meaning to cast his curse. He must have tested me. (Gold has already seen that it is useful for Old Locke to bring him to that place. If he can’t control the curse, then the curse is also Just falling to the mountains, there will be no major damage. Old Locke is a veteran, and has long considered all kinds of possibilities.) If this is the case, then there must be a chance to meet, then you can learn magic from him... ...Yes, now I’m going to study the magical formation on the piece of paper left by the old Locke. If you meet next time, please ask him...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei : The boy doesn't know what happened now? If it weren't for saving me, he wouldn't be caught. I really didn't use it. I didn't protect my loved ones before. I still can't protect others. I hope he can escape from the half-orcs. No, I must save him, even if I will be killed, even the people in front of me can't protect and talk about what is revenge for the family...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;column Husband: The magical creature called the baby is too dangerous. It is just so small. It has a deadly power when it is spit. If it grows up, what if it grows up? In the event of a beastly animal, we are in danger. And I heard that this magical creature is very long, and it is necessary to throw it away now. But I have to think about what reason to convince others...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elna: It’s weird, what is the person who calls himself Locke? Old Locke told his companions. Why did he pretend to be a weird old man? What is his purpose in approaching us? He seems to have a very strong power, but why can't I feel it at all? Now think about it, let us come to the city, take us to the site, let us know that the dark road is his intentional arrangement, this is ok! Is he just picking a few people just for someone to save the city, just pick us? Or for another reason, we don't know why. I don't like the feeling of being played, I have to figure out the next time I will meet - if there is another time...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behan: The poor fat uncle I don't know how! Hey, at that time, it’s a fierce servant to go out and iron. It’s a loyal servant! For the young man, even his life is not taken care of - he said, he is like my old housekeeper Uncle John, do not know whether his body is healthy in recent years, if I am in danger, he will save me from life. - I hope he can be safe. I don't know what kind of thing the young master is. It should be just an ordinary aristocratic master...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
