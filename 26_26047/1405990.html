			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 01<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold is surrounded by powerful forces, and he is familiar with this feeling. In the School of Magic, he did not know how many experiences he experienced. This is a unique feeling when contracting with the gods. It seems that this room was specially made to communicate with a certain god. The words that Kim just read started the magical array built in this room, and now the gods have signed a contract with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A brain that flows far beyond the powerful will of human beings into the brain, directly communicates with the gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I accept your request and allow you to use my power."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This powerful Will will print a prayer directly in the mind of Kim, and answer all the questions that Kim has in his head. The light disappeared, and the forces that made everyone unable to move were disappeared. Everyone slipped from the wall. They saw Kim standing in the middle of the room with an incredible expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contract with Jin just turned out to be the god of nothingness among the three chaos gods. It is impossible for human beings to use the power of chaos and the power of death! In the magical study of gold for more than ten years, this concept has been firmly rooted in his heart, and now he is even pulled up, he will of course be shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The God of Chaos represents all the unconventional, abnormal, and uncontrolled forces in the world, and the god of nothingness has given gold a qualification, one can control The qualification of the curse, all the magicians think that the curse is uncontrollable, because the curse uses an uncontrollable power, but this is a wrong conclusion, because once you exchange the contract with the god of chaos, you can borrow The power of the god of chaos to control the curse. Kim is no longer an ordinary magician. He became a cursed mage. (But it's useless before he learns to curse.)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone came to Kim with concern, and soon everyone knew it was What happened? Kim just set a contract with a new god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No wonder," said Old Locke. "Only God can have such a powerful force. I thought I thought something on this stone tablet?" It turned out to be a mantra that exchanged contracts with the gods!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone walked out of this room and began to explore in this abandoned palace. After two hours of activity, hunger finally defeated curiosity. Babe suggested that he should start eating lunch. This proposal was immediately passed. Everyone started looking for a suitable room for lunch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the time, seven people (including a pet) started enjoying their late lunch in the original restaurant of the palace (the current time for dinner) )). Everyone was sitting in a luxurious chair, eating around a table that was previously only qualified for use by nobles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, Father!" Lev was suddenly drawn to attention by something. "Look," he pointed his finger at the ceiling of the restaurant. Huge crystal ball, "What is that thing, hanging on the restaurant?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Locke is drinking, along the way, he has already drunk a lot of wine, Now he is trying hard to make the bottle empty, but his goal has not yet been achieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That," Old Locke drank the liquid in his mouth and replied casually. "That is the stone of the distance, used to see the ground. In the case, you can use it with a little magical energy.” He suddenly found himself saying too much, nervously looking at the people around him, but everyone did not find his flaws, everyone’s attention It was attracted by the stone of the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gold, give it a try!" Everyone said this to the magician, Kim actually wants to try it, he sends a magical energy to the far Inside the stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crystal ball immediately reacted, and some blurry scenes appeared on it, and then it became more and more clear, and finally the scene above the palace was completely displayed. Out. Wasteland, windy, weathered rocks, it is a scene of the half-orc wilderness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that everyone is eating and watching the situation outside, this distant stone is really amazing, it can monitor the situation of a large piece of land outside, I really don't know how the ancient magician made this thing. Suddenly, all seven people stopped eating, their eyes were staring at the stone of the distance, and they almost did not believe their eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stone of Yuanyuan faithfully casts all the scenery on the ground onto it. This is indeed a large army of half-orcs. The whole army is neatly tidy. Although it has traveled long distances, it still has high morale, like a long snake. I can't see the side, a rough estimate, at least a hundred thousand troops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I almost don’t believe my eyes, this is unquestionable. The half-orcs that have not appeared in the past ten years have to attack the city of Hope! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, now Hope City has no preparations, long-lasting peace has paralyzed the nerves of mankind, once the Orcs launch a sneak attack at night, that Hope The city is almost destined to fall. (Even if you don't fall, you have a good time.) Kim immediately stood up. Now is not the time to explore. Go back immediately and go back to the police. Everyone has the same idea, stop eating all, and stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go back, go back now!" The words of Kim represent the meaning of all the players, except for the old Locke - he is still drinking - everyone will start to clean up, ready to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leif suddenly thought of one thing. "Well, if you follow the original road and wander in the maze, it will take at least six hours, six hours to Hope City! I am afraid that the Orcs have already captured Hope City, it is too late! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is stunned. "Damn, can we only look at it but can't do anything?" Kim beat it on the table. All the players are silent, everyone is trying to find a way, but what can be done? Even if you come outside and fly back to Hope City with flying magic, it will take at least four hours. Four hours is enough for the Orc army to reach the city of Hope, so there is no alarm at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Locke slowly took the last bite of liquid, then stood up and said to everyone: "Why are you so anxious, is it time to go back?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When we go back, I am afraid I can catch up with the scene of Hope City!" The gold in anxiousness did not have any good mood and chatted with old Locke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? Can you see the speed of these guys marching to Hope City in an hour?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One hour? Father, you mean... can we get back to Hope City in an hour?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course, maybe It doesn't work for an hour!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You mean..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"here Hope City has a quick and secret way to go back from the secret road, and it only takes one hour!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Father!" Lev rushed to the face of Old Locke. "Why is there such a thing not to say earlier, but also to take such a long road?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Locke shook the empty bottle without hesitation. Cheeky replies: "If you don't go far, how can I have time to finish these bottles of wine?" (Leif is almost crazy)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Father, let's go!" Kim knows can't Wrong time, a little earlier back on more than a little time to prepare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This secret road is really fast, it took about 50 minutes to come to the exit Everyone climbed out from the narrow cave one by one. This exit is under an unobtrusive small mound outside Hope City. If you don't see it, 10,000 Jiangyang thieves can't find this secret passage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone almost rushed into the house of the Czech general, and even the guards at the door could not stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Czech General," Kim’s voice sat in the Czech Republic, which had not yet fallen asleep, and then he saw the young man rushing in like a whirlwind, bringing A message that immediately made him sleepy, "The Orcs attacked here!" Without any explanation, the general would understand immediately, because he was wondering for a patrol in the past few days. He got up at the fastest speed and then rushed to the military camp next to his home. The soldiers in the barracks are now just lying down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge bells of the alarm floated over Hope City, evoking people from the calm before going to sleep, and all locals knew it was an alarm for war. The Orc came to attack! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the human defense work was basically completed, the army of half-orcs finally appeared in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Czech stood on the wall, six adventurers stood by his side (the old man didn’t know where to go), they looked at the Orcs together The army is gradually approaching. Finally, the Orcs found that humans are fully prepared. They stopped moving forward and began to camp in the sight of humanity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A young military officer in armor ran to the Czech Republic. "General, why don't you fight?" he asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before you know the enemy, you should not be dispatched!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You Just look at these dirty half-orcs camping under our city?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s already dark, it’s bad for us, we can’t understand the enemy’s The situation is not as good as sticking to the city wall, so it is a foolproof practice!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't say it again, I am the commander here, obey the order!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Yes" after the other party lifted the official title The young officer finally gave in, but it can be seen from his eyes that he is absolutely dissatisfied with this order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, these are..." The young officer finally noticed the adventurers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are my friends, and this is the person who informed me of this information in time. It’s a great deal! Tell me about it, this is gold, this The position is Lev...” The Czech Republic introduced, and now everyone knows that this young officer is the son of Rom, the deputy commander of the army, Rom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 02<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day is finally bright, at night, the Orcs have no action, human The same is true, but the soldiers on the wall are not afraid to relax, and the sentinels of the Orcs are the same. Every warrior knows that this day will be the day of Pluto's harvest, because today there will be a lot of life to die under the sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day is just bright, the Orcs are challenged in the following teams in the city. They wave flags of various colors and call the humans on the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the lookout, the Czech Republic is carefully observing the enemy. From the size of the enemy’s military camp and the size of the battlefield, he judges that the enemy is about 11 to 130,000. There are not many enemies, because there are only 180,000 people in the city of Hope. Although the number of human beings predominates, the Czech general is still carefully observing the enemy and carefully analyzing whether there is a conspiracy here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orcs are almost the same as they were ten years ago, or they are lined up in a loose formation, or the kind of ugly, they are still waving The weapon screams at humanity and is still a chaotic army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the combat power of the half-orcs can not be ignored, they are stronger fighters than humans, talents and hard life have created their embarrassing character, their single The combat effectiveness of the soldiers is higher than that of human beings, and they are not afraid of death when they fight, and they are rushing forward. Although they are loosely disciplined, they are still terrible enemies. Humans do not know how many times they collapsed under the madness of their madness, and then they were ruthlessly pursued. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The biggest problem now is that the magician is not enough. Magic is the nemesis of the half-orc. As long as there is a strong fire cover of the magician, it is absolutely not a problem to defeat the half-orc. In the eyes of humans, the Orcs are a dirty, bloodthirsty, stupid and arrogant inferior race. They are stupid and can't master the esoteric technique of magic. Although they are a bit resistant to magic, being resistant doesn't mean they are not afraid of magic. In fact, the most feared by the Orcs is magic. As long as there are enough magicians to cooperate with the soldiers' attack, the half-orcs are invincible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Hope City is not a magician now, although Dike has a powerful magician regiment, but now in the capital city of ice and snow, due to ten years of peace, There aren't many military magicians in Hope City. There are only fifty magicians in the city. Fifty magicians are meaningless to 100,000 orcs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Czechs were thinking, Rom rushed over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everything must be careful, then watch for a while!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After observing for a while, we have to wait until they take us outside the city. Everything, and then when the big model left, obviously? We are dominant, why not play."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..."The Czech Republic knows that there is nothing wrong with this, half When the orcs wait until they are impatient, they will rob all the houses outside the city (although everyone has already entered the city) and then return home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This guy, old, has no courage. Well, you dare not go out, then I am going to fight, as long as I beat the Orcs, the news spread to the capital, see if you can continue to be the commander-in-chief. At that time, the entire Hope City was ours, and it was no longer disturbed by your old things. Isn't it a half-orc? Anything that is so scary, look at their appearance of a rabble, I can beat them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Czech Republic certainly does not know the idea of ​​the deputy, he is thinking of a good way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, if you must, I will send you to fight. How many troops do you think can defeat these dirty guys?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"80,000 is enough!" Although eager to fight, but Rom is indeed a good talent, he quickly judged the total amount of combat effectiveness of both sides, and then got a correct The conclusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait a minute!" Kim just came in from outside, and he quickly stopped the troops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two, please listen to my opinion, I believe this is a trap for the half-orcs. I saw that they were very neat when marching, before and after the army. Orderly, it’s not like this mess now, there must be fraud.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little Roma’s mouth is tilted with a scornful smile, he Write his meaning clearly to his face. "There are more people who don't know the military!" He ignored the gold and went down to prepare for the city battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Czech General! Why don't you stop him?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reassured, Kim, I The idea is the same as you, I also think that the Orcs have a conspiracy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "But, however, I want to eat 80,000 troops in a single bite. The Orcs still don't have such good teeth and appetite. My plan is to let Rom infer the trap and then retreat to the range of the bows on the wall." Inside, and then use the bows and arrows on the wall as a cover, under the city as much as possible to consume the orc's combat power, with the support of the arrow on the wall, no matter what, Rom can support a long period of time. It is possible to consume the half-orc's physical strength and spirit. Then I can use the main force to attack and defeat the half-orc. Even if the half-orc does not catch up - of course, this is only a possibility, the half-orc is impossible to not catch up - I can also know The trap arrangement of the half-orcs determines that the war is a defensive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p; The Czechs stood up and said in a heroic tone, "No matter what happens, as long as there are 30,000 soldiers on Hope City, the half-orcs will never be able to attack. And I will be on the wall no matter what the circumstances. Leave 30,000 soldiers just in case."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold does not speak, the words of the Czech general are impeccable, whether it is victory or failure, he is ready The worst plan, even if defeated, will never fail completely. As long as you can defend the city, the Orcs will be helpless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Czech General," Kim suddenly raised a question. "I have heard that the half-orcs in history have captured this city. How did they succeed?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The siege! Three years of siege! The grain is cut off!" The Czech general said as he walked out, "There is no need to save the soldiers, there is no city to defend!" This scene will not repeat itself!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Outside the city, in a humble position in the Orc's army, a young half-orc is standing there. His dress is almost the same as the ordinary half-orc warrior, but his side is surrounded by ten very powerful warriors, who all look at the figure in front of them with respect, they are his guards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A scout ran fast, and he ran to the young half-orc with the fastest speed, then squatted: "Glory, those Humans have acted!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!" All the half-orcs bowed their heads and they quickly spread the orders throughout the army. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gates of Hope City are opened, and a human army flows out of the city and into the battlefield. (Hope City is built on the hill, the city walls Build an arc, there is only one gate in the whole city.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two armies are now confrontation on the battlefield. Although it is very confusing, it can be recognized that the orcs are arranged in In the triple battle, they waved all kinds of flags, and insulted the opposite human beings with the most vicious words. The flags were so great that the gold on the wall could not see their Chinese army and the army. In his eyes. It’s just a sea of ​​flags.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Human is ranked as the most common, minimally flawed ordinary circular array, although they have no more enemies, but the armor is bright (half The orc's armor is all kinds of), the military capacity is strict, the soldiers are arranged in order, and they are neatly marching under the command of the commander, which is particularly powerful and powerful.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The human front finally began to move forward, and the Orc striker also greeted The two armies began to come into contact.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the wall, human officers and soldiers are carefully watching the battle, including six people including Kim and the Czech general.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-orc is really powerful. In the earliest contact with the left wing, the human circular array is like a watermelon cut into a knife, and it is broken through a big gap, and humans stop moving forward. Under the fierce attack of the Orcs, the circular array began to turn.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But humans did not collapse under this terrible attack, and as the circular array turned, they broke into the enemy. The half-orcs in the array began to lose contact with the team and were pushed to the human flanks separately. The sides of the broken gap began to compress into the sides. These half-orcs are now surrounded by human beings and are eliminated bit by bit. After the enemy was removed, the circular array was broken through a gap, and then began to turn again, and the enemies that had entered the enemy were taken away from the brigade, and then the enemies that were invaded were again eaten under the superior force.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone in the city, including six The adventurers are all amazed by the superb commanding skills of Rom. This level of control and command can be attributed to the genius, and everyone believes that humans have won.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The human warfare repeats this scene. A batch of half-orcs are swallowed and disappeared by this rotating death vortex. The half-orcs can't support it. The striker begins to retreat and closes with the Chinese army. The Chinese army also seemed to be shocked by this terrible vortex, and they began to retreat. The front line began to push to the limit of the city wall view, the half-orcs began to stop retreating, and they began to fight back and forth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the powerful offensive of the enemy, mankind began to retreat. Although the half-orc’s individual combat capability is stronger than that of human beings, the battlefield can be won by one person alone. The advantages of human collective cooperation began to appear. Although it was swooped, the arc of human beings began to flatten under strong pressure, but the half-orcs also paid a huge price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fierce attack stopped, the Orcs began to retreat, and humans began to advance to the enemy’s army, this time the Chinese army did not move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When all the spectators thought that the victory was in the grip, the situation suddenly changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 03<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without any omen, the half-orc blew the horn and was fighting The Orcs began to recede like the tide, revealing the reef behind. In an instant, the Orcs put down all the flags, and the original flag of the sea suddenly disappeared in front of humans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the enemy who is fighting is suddenly retreating, Rom is very strange, he is strictly not allowed to pursue, want to know what the other side is doing. The enemy in front of him receded, and Romly saw clearly what was behind these miscellaneous soldiers - a terrible army was arranging this strict queue in front of humans, when the soldiers saw the enemies in front of them, everyone Can't help but suck a cold air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gold on the wall only saw the half-orc suddenly put all the flags away. He was very strange and turned to ask the Czech Republic. "God! God!" Kim just saw the Czech general whispering in despair, because he recognized the only flag that was still flying, that is the flag of the King of Tooth, and the flag of the Wild Bet Corps! ! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Author's Note: The Orcs are said to be races created by God of War, although in the eyes of humans they are stupid and dirty, but they are also the best fighters on the continent, all half-orcs can fight, including women and Children. This race is deeply loved by the God of War. In addition to giving them strong flesh and many special strengths, God of War also gave them extremely militant customs. Their society is very different from human beings. On the one hand, the highest leader of the Orcs - The king of the tooth commanded all the half-orcs. On the other hand, according to living habits and blood, the half-orcs were divided into eighteen tribes. The tribal chiefs were hereditary. Although the chiefs must obey the king of teeth, the king of the teeth has no power. Replace the chieftain. The king of the half-orc is not caused by blood. Whenever the king of the last tooth is aging, he will take the inheritance of the king of teeth as "the hammer of the god of war" (in legend, this weapon is The God of War is not only a powerful weapon but also a proof of being the king of the tooth. It is given to the heir chosen by him. The heir will be in front of the public. Bring the Hammer of the God of War, indicating that it has become the king of new teeth. The Orcs have a mad beast that is only loyal to the King of the Tooth. They are the most elite of the Orcs, with the terrible fighting power of the Wild Bet Corps, the Orcs. I have been engaged in tug-of-war with the high-level goblins for 50 years (but in the end they surrendered in the long-term siege of the high-level goblins). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the war of liberation, the King of Tooth killed the battlefield, and the Wild Bet Corps was also wiped out, but the High Fairy also paid a terrible price for this victory. Their losses are almost no less than their opponents. In this fierce battle, the hammer of the god of war was lost with the death of the king of teeth, and it was not found for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the war, the Orcs demanded that the human beings promised their land, but humans believe that the Orcs did not play any role and refused (the decisive victory is human gain) of). With this as the fuse, the contradiction between the two races has finally broken out. Although there is no king of teeth, in the presence of the common enemy, the chiefs of the 18 tribes of the Orcs are united. They form an army and intend to fight with humans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shengguang is not only a good commander, but also a wise politician. He knows that human victory is a triumph, even though the Orcs have lost the mad beasts and teeth. The king, but its military strength is still stronger than the current human beings. Nowadays, human beings are in desperate need of rest and recuperation. He immediately seeks peace with the half-orcs and gives the half-orcs a lot of promised land. Not only a lot, but he also allowed humans close to the Orc territory to migrate out of their original land, leaving a large unmanned area for the Orcs (and only the Holy Light has this prestige to do so without opposition) ). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-orcs do not know what to count, they see humans have migrated from this land, of course, the natural zhan has this land of no ownership. Then, under the ingenious provocation of the Holy Light, the tribes of the Orcs began to quarrel for the biggest gain in this unexpected wealth, and finally evolved into a full-scale civil war, with 18 tribes fighting each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the recovery of humanity, the half-orcs became weak and chaotic in the civil war. Under the command of the Holy Light, humans used their half-orcs to occupy their land ( To add sin, why not have words) as an excuse to fight the Orcs. The half-orcs have no power to fight back and are defeated by human beings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the goal of the Holy Light is not only to recapture the land, he knows that only half-orcs on the lost continent may also pose a threat to human rule, he wants to be a descendant of future generations. Eliminate this threat. Humans have implemented a "three light" policy on half-orcs, killing every half-orc that they can find. Under the threat of human blood and fire, the half-orcs were forced to migrate northward, but the human army has been pursuing them firmly, and countless half-orcs have fallen under the bloody blade and terrible magic of humans. The half-orcs had no choice. In order to escape the human massacre, they fled their homes (now the Kingdom of Dicco), escaped the wilderness of the half-orcs in the north, and fled to the extreme north, which is called the bitter cold of mankind. On the land. This big migration has caused the half-orcs to lose two-thirds of the population, and it has also allowed humans and half-orcs to form irresistible hatred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Holy Light had intended to wipe out the Orcs from the lost continent, at the crucial moment, the gods intervened to intervene in this matter. They recognize that mankind gains the dominion of this continent, but does not allow them to root another race (the half-orcs are, after all, the creations of the gods). The gods of the gods stopped humanity from chasing. The Holy Light built a city (the city of ice and snow) in the center of the original Orc land to strengthen human rule, and later built six seats on the side of the Orc Wilderness. The fortress city acts as a defense against the half-orcs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next thousand years, the Orcs have been in the midst of division, and the 18 tribes sometimes have alliances sometimes wars, when they form a short-term alliance internally, they Attacking humans in the south, and fighting each other when the alliance breaks down. The biggest ideal of a half-orc is to find the hammer of the god of war, to become the king of teeth, and to unite all the orcs together under one banner, but no one has succeeded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the flag of the King of Tooth, even the Czech general was shocked. He didn't need to say that he knew what was going to happen. He immediately sent someone to let Rom retreat, but everything was too late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The terrible rhinoceros heavy armored assault cavalry appeared in front of humans. (The rhinoceros heavy armored cavalry is the elite assault force of the mad beasts. These half-orcs can't shoot through the heavy armor with their bows and arrows. They hold a sword with both hands and ride the woolly rhinoceros with the chain mail. They don't use them. Riding a gun, because the rhinoceros on the head of the rhinoceros - of course, with a sharp edge - completely replaced the use of the rifle, without any battle can be banned from the impact of this terrible army.)<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gele stood on a small hillside and looked at this scene. He felt that his eyes were a little moist. The scene in front of him was his long-cherished dream. He is now commanding the heroic mad beasts. Fight against the despicable human beings. He waved his hand hard, and the drums immediately rang, and when he heard the drums marching into the army, the rhinoceros heavy armored cavalry began to advance forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the sound of the drums, the tens of thousands of hooves were shaking, and the rhinoceros cavalry rushed over to the humans. The terrible momentum shocked all The humans, after they rushed over, only the brave fighters could resist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In just five minutes, the iron hoof of the rhinoceros heavy armored cavalry crushed all the insignificant resistance, and the entire human army was in a panic, but they Has been doomed to return to his hometown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two-winged Orc Wolf Cavalry (Wolf Cavalry is a fast force, they are not only fierce, but also lightly equipped, fast, bloodthirsty), although they are fighting The endurance of the wolves is not comparable to that of the horses, but in a short distance they are faster than the horses. They form a pliers that enclose the fleeing human beings. The wolf cavalry ruthlessly falls the wolf's teeth and the swords in their hands. Panicked humans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After understanding that they can’t escape, humans are reorganized, they have heroic resistance, and Rom is refreshing, and the governor is fighting, all his hopes are The Czech Republic can dispatch troops in time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Czech Republic organized a rescue force with his fastest speed, but Gölcher had already taken countermeasures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A half-orc infantry rushed over, they are the main force of the mad beasts - honorary fighters. The honorary warriors are the most powerful warriors in the mad beasts. They wear armor, the soldiers hold their hands with giant swords, and the officers are wielding a warhammer modeled after the hammer of the god of war. This unit has a steel-like will and a storm-like destructive power. It can be said that there is nothing to compete with them except the barbarian. Because of the blessings of the God of War, they are extremely resistant to magic, and the general magic is ineffective against them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The honorary fighters rushed into the battlefield, and the double-edged swords in their hands were shining with glare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 30,000-man rescuer of human beings was blocked by honorary soldiers. This is not a battle of the same level. It is simply a unilateral massacre. Human beings are mass-produced like straw. The cut of the Orc's weapon is stained with human blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 04<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Czech Republic knows that everything is useless, he ordered the retreat, 30,000 soldiers Beginning to fight back and forth, after entering the bow and arrow range of the city wall, the honor soldiers stopped chasing and they withdrew. Watching humans return to the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little Roma’s troops are in despair, they are completely in enemy positions and cannot break through. In desperation, humans evoke extraordinary courage and strength, and they carry out the defense of death, even the elite mad beasts can not break through their intensive battles and the fleshy walls of swords and armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gerle looked at it all, the rhinoceros cavalry was hacking humans in batches, killing them with rhinoceros horns, smashing them with iron hooves, humans The resistance in front of this terrible enemy is very weak. However, the wolf cavalry has suffered a lot of casualties under human resistance. Geller felt that this situation could not continue. He immediately ordered the mobilization of the remote troops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the wall of Hope City, everyone can only watch Rom is tightly surrounded but unable to do anything. After seeing the terrible fighting power of the Wild Bet Corps, every Individuals know that there is no difference between leaving the city and sending death. Kim and his companions were watching this scene. Kim suddenly asked Wei, who was dignified: "Like this kind of enemy," he pointed to the honorary warrior who was still glory in the city. "How much can you deal with?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The resistance of Rom is finally over. The archer of the Orc shoots the dense arrow rain on the human head that is squeezed into a pile. The blood fills the earth like water, and the dead body covers the ground, in the Orcs. Under the attack, the 80,000-strong army of the whole army was wiped out. The small Roma himself was also in the middle of the arrow and fell on the battlefield. On the walls of Hope City, humans prayed to the gods with fear and anger, praying that their compatriots could rest in peace. The news outside the city has spread throughout the city, and many women have taken to the streets to grieve for their dead husband or son, and to worry about their future destiny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now is not an enemy that Hope City can deal with. The Czech general has already let the pigeons of the emergency military take off, but Geller has already let the falcon fly. Above the city of Hope, in the sight of people, the flying pigeons have become victims of the eagle's claws. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to cope with the immediate emergency, all the young and middle-aged people in the city are mobilized. Everyone knows what it means to break through the city. There is no choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You must immediately ask the capital for help. Immediately, although there are still 100,000 regular troops in the city, but the horrible mad beasts under the city, no one can say that they must stick to it. live. But how can we spread the news? (If no one sends a letter, the capital will get at least three months.) The pigeons that had passed the military have all been killed. The wolf cavalry is swinging down the city. It is impossible to send someone to send a letter. Is there no other way? The Czech Republic is eager to walk around the headquarters. Although he has been through many battles, he is unable to do anything at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orcs did not continue to attack the city after winning the victory. Today’s fierce battle also made them a bit tired. This victory is so brilliant, human beings are absolutely not afraid. Once again, I went to the city to fight. In addition to cleaning the battlefield and wandering to monitor the human wolf cavalry, the half-orcs returned to the military camp to recharge their tomorrow's total attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There must be someone to ask for help, the Czech general made up his mind, at dusk, he issued an order to collect the death squad, and he intends to send the death squad to break through the enemy camp this evening. As long as there is a person who can break out, it will be fine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What should we do?" Kim broke the silence between the six people in the hotel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Everyone did not answer. Today they have seen the terrible fighting power of the Wild Bet Corps. It is impossible to win by the power of this city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only Babe is still very happy, she is using her fingers to tease the baby. She is at a carefree age and it is easy to forget all the unhappiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What we have to do! If the Orcs win, the city is over!" Although they have encountered some hateful guys in this city, But also met a good man like the Czech general. Moreover, if the city breaks, they will not be spared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You must go out to the city to ask for reinforcements!" Lev said that everyone knows the answer, this answer is easy to come by, but it is too difficult to achieve. Now! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But it’s almost impossible to rush out of the enemy front!" Behan said, the daytime battle gave everyone the conclusion that "other methods must be used." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have an idea," Elna said, letting everyone turn their eyes to her. "I think, Kim, can you fly out of the city and fly?" Go to a safe place to land, so you can send a message!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard this, Wei shook his head and he retorted Elna in sign language. Opinions: "There are a lot of enemies outside the city. They will definitely notice that some people fly out of the city. They will follow at the foot of Kim until he runs out of magic and kills him. A person flying in the sky is too Obviously, can't be hidden!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you can fly out at night!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s useless. Since the half-orcs use the eagle to attack our pigeons during the day, they will definitely prepare the owls in the evening. I heard that the half-orcs can be tamed. All the beasts, even World of Warcraft, are no exception. Moreover, even if the owl does not attack gold, the mounts of the wolf cavalry will certainly find gold, and the wolf has animals with night vision ability!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;金 stands up: "But I have to try it anyway, this is almost the only promising way!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No!" Also stand up, "I can't see you go to death!" He gestured to express his meaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a minute!" Babe also found that the situation was wrong. The atmosphere between Kim and Wei became very tense. She quickly stopped. "I have a way!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Everyone, including Kim and Wei, turned their faces to the little girl. In these days, Babe’s performance was excellent. Sometimes everyone even forgets that she is a little girl, treating her as a real adventurer, a real Companion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's like this,...it's like this..." Actually, Babe didn't have a good idea. She just blurted it out. She tried hard to start her brain. Think of a ready-made approach, "Yes," Babe suddenly flashed in his head. "We can avoid the half-orc through the dark path of the grandfather!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Yeah! Why didn't I think about it!" Lev shot his head. "From that dark path, everything is solved, and we don't have to go through the maze. I remember there are several in the middle of the dark passage. Export, as long as you sneak into the entrance outside the city at night without causing the enemy to detect..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is easy, just cover it with magic!" Kim interrupted, he has absolute confidence to bring everyone so close to the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, it’s so decided! Let a person go to the Czech general to ask for a letter of assistance. The other people will clean up and prepare to leave!" Arouse the confidence of all, the adventurers acted with the fastest speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day is finally dark, when the death squad rushes out of the city, the six adventurers under the cover of magic, to the dark passage, they also hold five Ma, these horses are sent by the Czech Republic. With the horse's foot strength and the therapist returning the horse to fatigue, they can send the emergency military situation within a week. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adventurers are marching underground, and the sounds are coming from time to time. Everyone knows that the battle has begun, but they can only bless the warriors in their hearts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long walk in silence, the adventurers walked up the ground in a safe place and they immediately rode on horses (Babe and Ai Erna rides a ride, flying towards the city of ice and snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the way, everyone tried their best to speed up, whether it is eating and sleeping, they are desperately saving time. When the horse is tired, let Elna use the treatment. Recovery, after six days of rushing, everyone finally arrived at the destination. On the sixth day of the dark, everyone arrived at the city of ice and snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s dark, all the tricks are closed, but the adventurers are anxious to give the letter to the king of Dike, knowing that there is more than one In the evening, Hope City is in danger of falling more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unscrupulously, Jin remembered the great magician Raymond, yes, there must be no mistake to find him. After letting everyone go to rest (everyone is exhausted, especially Babe and Elna, one is a little girl, one all the way to use healing), Kim alone took the letter to find Raymond. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond’s family gold is already very familiar, and he soon came to the magic door, just in front of a magician opening the door, his back view It is very familiar, it seems to be one of Raymond’s apprentices. Kim Daxi was over-looking. He yelled "Let's wait!" and ran over. When he reached the distance that could see the face, Kim found out who the person was in front of him. The magician in front turned around and he turned out to be Brett. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 05<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright also saw gold, and he was taken aback. How is this damn guy still in the city? He clearly has gone? But as Kim approaches, he can also see the exhaustion portrayed in the golden face, and something must happen! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright stopped the spell he was reading. The magic door that had not been fully opened immediately fell, and the two former students fell into a silent confrontation. . But Kim is now in a hurry, and he breaks the silence between two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bright, open the door, I am in a hurry to find Mr. Raymond!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's the matter? The teacher has rested, you can't bother him, let's talk tomorrow! And you don't need me to open this door?" Some people say that the enemy's pain is their own joy. This sentence is in Bulai. The special body was reflected - he felt very anxious when he saw the golden anxious appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh?" Brett was dubious. After all, there were no half-orcs in the North for ten years, and even the original magician troops were withdrawn to the capital. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's true! You see, I have a letter written by the Czech general!" Kim knows that this is really hard to believe, he broke the letter. Let Bright clearly see the seal above. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that moment, there were countless sparks in Breit’s mind, each spark representing a different approach, but the last spark was burning, Overshadowed all the same kind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't go in, come with me," said Brett. "This is too urgent. We don't have to go to see the teacher. I am also a royal family." One member, I have the right to enter the palace directly!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold followed by cloth Come to the entrance to the palace, the guards on the outside clearly knew Brett, and they let Brette walked through the sentry with a stranger. But the internal (Palace Gate) sentinel blocked two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr.Bright," the guard was very polite. "It’s already late. You can’t bring a stranger to the palace. This is Violation of the rules."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My friend has something important!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry I don't doubt you, but, you know, we have to comply with the regulations. Unfortunately, I can only allow you to go in alone. Your friend can only wait here before dawn."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about it? Kim gave the letter to Brett, and Brett disappeared into the palace with a hurry. After about half an hour, the figure of Brett finally reappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The King took the letter and immediately ordered the call. Important ministers, they are ready to save the army, it is estimated that they can leave after four days, and they can reach Hope City in fourteen days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Four days!!!???"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, the transfer, organization, appointment, and logistics of the military, these are not completed in one day or two. Things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This way..." Kim was a bit disappointed, but he knew that the supplies in Hope City could definitely support more than two months. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, His Majesty the King hopes that you can return to Hope City to inform this matter. If you can break out, you can definitely go back and report!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will definitely go back as soon as possible!" Brett looked at the back of Kim with a vicious eye. This idiot didn’t know how much it would cost to see the sleeping king. Time, only half an hour, how can I call the minister to have a meeting! After he determined that Kim had gone away, he took out a letter from his arms and lit the paper with magic. There was not much time, and there was a little more ash at the foot of Brett. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Orc attacked Hope City, it was the death of this idiot. Blatant thought so eagerly. He looked back at the guard. This person just witnessed it. Everything, his face has a doubtful expression. Breit looked at the tiles on the roof of the palace. A piece of tile accidentally fell down and killed a person who would not be suspicious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold and friends are sitting in the tunnel, they are waiting for the dark, The half-orc still surrounds the city, and it seems that the city has not fallen. After insisting on ten days of reinforcements, Kim came to think. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is very tired, Babe is sitting and falling asleep. But everyone else is insisting that the sky is already dark, but there are still half-orc wolf cavalry in the vicinity, and after a while, the wolf cavalry will leave and they can return to the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gold! Do you feel very strange?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is weird?"< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This seems to be too smooth, we just found out that the Orc attack, just come back to the police, just use the dark road to ask for help, everything is too strange, it seems to be arranged The same is good!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Old Locke is suspicious! He seems to be deliberately letting us come to Hope City, deliberately taking us to the site, deliberately letting us know this dark passage so that we can save the city!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Impossible? This should just be a coincidence!" Kim remembered the old-fashioned look of the old Locke, and he thought that he could not be the arranger of all this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is thinking about Lev’s question, the more I want to be more and more like this, at this time, Behan came from the exit, and his words interrupted everyone. The idea: "You can leave, those damn wolf cavalry have left."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Czechs met with six adventurers. He was very happy with the news they brought. In his estimation, the reinforcements will arrive in about ten to fifteen days, because they will inevitably be blocked by the Orcs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How are these days?" Kim asked the Czech general. "Is there any behavior for the half-orcs?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "No, since the time you left, the Orcs did not have any changes, but the siege devices in their camps have been shipped in batches!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The evening, the adventurers slept for the first time in a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, everyone once again walked onto the city wall, and the Orcs were arrogantly placing the siege devices close to the city wall, trying to induce humans out of the city. Attacking these devices, and they only sent a small number of people to protect these devices, their main force is a long way from these devices. But the veteran Czechs see through this trap, and the Orc's wolf cavalry is at a good distance (looks far, but actually just), and will surely arrive in time when humans attack these devices. So even though the Orcs did this, he did not send anyone to attack the city, but to firmly guard the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are half-orcs who have not attacked the city, but the tension in the city is more than one day a day. Everyone knows that once the orcs attack, it must be exhausted. Intensively, looking at the siege devices that are more than a day, anyone will have the feeling of "quiet before the storm." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The storm finally arrived on the seventh day of their arrival, the day was just bright, the sentinel on the wall blew the alarm, and the soldiers who had been nervous were immediately Everyone, six adventurers also took to the top of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today is indeed the day of the total attack. Under Hope City, the Orcs set up a neat battle, and the original plus the support force, the total number is no less than 200,000. . The 200,000 orcs did not make a little noise, and the land that was about to become a battlefield is now filled with the silence of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elite mad beasts are lined up in front of the gates of Hope City, on their heads, flying their flag high, Humans can clearly see the flag that is called "the flag of God of War" by humans. This flag is said to be given to the half-orcs by the god of war. The four corners of the flag are painted with four weapons: spear, sword, bow and axe. In the center is the hammer of the god of the tooth, symbolizing the command of the king of the tooth. All the half orcs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Human is also prepared for resistance, the entire wall is covered with human archers, and the slinger behind the wall is ready, once the orcs When they launch a storm, they will suffer huge casualties. Residents near the city wall have already withdrawn, and humans have prepared a large amount of burning materials in these houses as a defensive line after the city wall was broken. The Czech general saw that the Orcs put all the siege weapons in the east of the city, and it seems that they intend to break through there. Although the enemy's elite force, the Wild Bet Corps, was placed on the front of the gate, he transferred the most elite troops to the east. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time is slowly passing in silence, half-orc. There has been no movement, they seem to be waiting for anything. The humans did not relax at all. They all looked nervously at the enemies under the city. Everyone knew that this silence would not last long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is that?" I don’t know who made the cry, all humans looked up to the horizon, and there was something black and pressed on the horizon, as if It is a dark cloud. But the strange thing is that there is no wind at present, but the cloud has drifted to this side at a very fast speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This strange cloud attracts everyone’s attention, and the six adventurers are also watching the cloud that is getting closer and closer, that strange black The cloud finally reached the human eye and could clearly see what distance it was. When humans saw what it was, they all made a frightening cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
