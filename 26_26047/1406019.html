			<div id="content">The dragon group is surrounded here and communicates with each other in a way that is unique to them, but no matter who they are, even the elders themselves, they are helpless. This matter is beyond their ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the huge body of the dragons, the red dragon is lying, its fire of life is very weak, in fact, in addition to still At the very least, there are no other signs of life on the body of the baby. Its fellows can only watch this little dragon, which has not yet differentiated from rationality, slowly weaken, but they can't do anything about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragons have a very strong vitality, their bodies can withstand almost all the damage, and the fatal damage to other races is not for them. What is a serious problem, and because of this, the dragon does not know how to treat it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere is unusually silent, although there are so many powerful dragons here, they can't do anything. They have sought help from the therapists, but the condition of this baby is beyond the knowledge of all, and healing can only be a temporary effect in it - and then everything is restored to its original state. Look like. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long elder suddenly raised his head, his senses alerted him, something powerful has approached Long Island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His feelings are not wrong, very quickly, all the dragons feel this extraordinary power, they have made a guardful posture. Then, under the attention of the dragon group, a figure appeared in this giant cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is a human body that is many times smaller than these giants. In fact, in humans, she is also very small - because she only But it is a little girl in her teens. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bebe ignoring the surrounding dragons - the smallest of them, the thinnest paws are bigger than her - go straight to the baby, use One hand picked up the baby dragon that was almost as big as the dog, and then turned to face the elders of the dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to take it away!" Babe announced loudly, "It has belonged to the category of death, it belongs to me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elder Long did not answer. He kept his eyes on this uninvited guest and projected his will directly into the other's mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bebe did not resist the invasion of this idea, and then they launched a communication at the spiritual level that is unclear whether it is contest or communication. After the end, the elder Long took back his sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can take it away!" Long elder answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Continental Empire in February 998, the main force of the Leite Empire in the plains of Mazzar and The Red Alliance army battle, the result of this battle is that no one expected, with the help of a cavalry suspected of being undead, the Leiter army won an astonishing victory, the main force of the Alliance Army was defeated, then The main military base of the Red Alliance besieged the Red Alliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But before the battle, the Red Alliance had split a force to attack the city of Berek, and the team immediately heard the news of the main failure. Back to the game, successfully returned to Izumo City before the enemy's siege, plus the other remnants of the defeated army, the combat power has exceeded the enemy's load, so that the Rite army did not be able to attack this strong fortress as planned. After a period of meaningless confrontation, the Red Alliance’s governing body, the Caravan Federation, succumbed and summoned the Emperor Victor, and Victor knew that he did not have the strength to attack the city and get a complete Victory, so in the case of preservation of the face, the military stopped the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this compromise of name does not mean that the war is over, because the alliance itself is a relatively loose combination, and their army is basically used Mercenaries hired by money. Although most of the big businessmen decided to give in, the most serious damage to some of the interests decided to resist. This is why, although the war has ended in name now, the atmosphere in the border is actually more tense than at any other time. The Ritter army was constantly harassed, and the supply line was constantly hit by elite mercenaries. Any small units that were placed on the order could hardly reach their destination, and they lacked the means to deal with this unusually flexible guerrilla warfare. Although the Leite Empire occupied a large area of ​​the Red Alliance in the victory, it is a place that is sparsely populated and cannot effectively block the penetration and sneak attack of the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behan faced his companions with a very awkward gesture, because the girl who claimed to be his fiancee insisted on sitting in his arms, and his attitude was firm, and he refused to give in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You said that Behan was a deputy head before?" Lev looked at the man who revealed the reality to him with an unbelievable expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Behan was our deputy head four years ago." The old mercenary was laid back on the fire with the kettle on it. Adding a firewood and answering it casually, "And it is the commando captain before Miss Lis! He will fight and use his brain, right, he will also make girls happy, no matter how old. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last sentence is a satirical effect, because anyone can see that the girl named Lisi is still very young, should be still four years ago. Can only be regarded as a child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Four years ago?" Lev was unceremoniously mentioning the key points that would otherwise not be picked up by others. "At that time, Lisi Miss..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thirteen years old! What's the matter?" The girl who leaned on Behan did not disguise her answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thirteen years old?" At this moment, Lev simply put the devil's horns and tails on his body. He didn't say anything, just use his deep meaning. The eyes looked at each of their companions, and the reactions of the three people were different. Wei Lu slightly wrinkled his brow, and Jin turned his face a little, as if he didn't hear it, and Elna's face showed a little contemptuous look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't be like this, Lisi!" Behan reached out and pushed the girl away. "You are no longer a child!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What does it matter? I am your fiancee!" Liz immediately glued back, and the attitude of her relatives made her smile in the belly of the next. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't talk, there is nothing between us!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's your own Promise to marry me!" Liss said in a spoiled tone that only the wife can be in front of her husband or the child can show in front of her parents. "And, you swear before the gods, ten witnesses have witnessed your vows!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That was just playing with the kids! Because at that time you I love crying too much, and the head of the team always throws you to take care of me... I really have no way to come up with these ways to make you happy..." Behan said as he turned his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you ever liked me?" Liz suddenly changed her tone. She stretched out her hands and forcibly turned Behan over to face her face, and both eyes looked at Behan's eyes without hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I like you, but not the kind of men and women..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now don't want me Is it because of this sister?" Lisi interrupted Behan’s words and said that her beautiful eyes suddenly revealed a murder from the depths, reminding Behan that this beautiful girl is now a mercenary commando captain. identity of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere suddenly became tense, and Lisi looked at the therapist in front of him. No matter from her expression and her gaze, she is hostile, no, it is simply killing, and it makes the people who are present feel clear. The magician unconsciously started a new prayer in his heart, and Wei also put his hand on the hilt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The leader of this sinister situation, Lev, is now in a state of stunned. He didn't think that things would actually develop to this point. He just wanted to take this opportunity to blow down Behan, but things suddenly exceeded his expectations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha..." Erna suddenly laughed, and it was hard to show a charming smile. "You really laugh, Miss Lis, I and Bay." Han is just a companion who is adventurous. Apart from this, there is no other relationship between us. Moreover, "She gently held Lev's arm with one hand - this action caused the thieves to resemble paralysis. Consequences - make a relative gesture, "He is my boyfriend!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gold on one side has already determined that Elna definitely has the talent for acting. Lev obviously lacks this ability. The scene of a man who is completely stiff and a woman leaning against his arm can not be said to be convincing, although it has diluted the murderousness emanating from the girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Right, how come you come here? Head of the team? How have I never seen it?" Behan quickly slammed the subject. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course you can't see it, because this time I led the army!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You ?......The battle was just directed by you?" Behan didn't believe his ears. Although she was the daughter of the head of the team, she was only seventeen years old, so she led her army to the enemy... How could the headmaster do it? Out of this judgment? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yeah... don't you believe it?" Liz said proudly, and then she couldn't help herself, and began to giggling. "In fact, it is totally different from what you think. I don't have this skill... In fact, it depends on another person to command the battle?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He!" Lisi Xiang Pointed at the top of the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five people raised their heads in unison. Under the blue sky, there seems to be nothing but white clouds, but the eyes of the adventurers noticed the little shadow in the sky - it was an eagle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He is coming down!" said Liss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadow slowly grows bigger and begins to clear. It is indeed an eagle, and it is unusually large. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Use the eagle to scout..." Behan said to himself. This is indeed a good idea. However, it is too difficult to domesticate an eagle that can perform reconnaissance missions. Moreover, the eagle can easily confuse things that are artificially set. Just relying on such an animal will dare to go deep into the enemy. Adventure, this is not the style of the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge air waves generated by the eagle flaps began to hit the dust on the ground. This eagle is really big, beyond the common sense of the average person, it seems to make The man sat on its back. But Behan also knows that this is not possible, even if it can really carry a person, it can't be loaded for too long, and the human eye itself is not suitable for observing the ground at high altitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eagle fell to the ground, a long half-length boy like a boy jumped from the back of the eagle with a light movement, he first touched his hand Animal companion, then began to face Lisi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can sleep peacefully tonight, without any enemies moving, I will go see it later in the middle of the night!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several soldiers made a cheer, which is definitely good news, indicating that their battle today is so good that no enemy has escaped. Otherwise, the enemy will definitely send troops to search for the band. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Half...body?!" The magician screamed out loud, this race he has seen many times in the book, but really See it for the first time. The Forest Alliance is known for its mystery, and few halflings leave their homes to human land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in spite of this, the halflings are not particularly ethnically hostile to humans - because humans are almost hostile to all other races - they have little to do with humans, But it is recognized as a race of peace and courtesy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!" Liz did not avoid the suspicion of sticking to Behan. "He is our scout! With him, we can go all the way." We have ambushed four groups of enemies this week, and their total is almost one and a half times ours!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good dear!" The halfling I found these strangers who I didn't know. He took off his hat and took a look at "Busch is working for you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello "The magician hurriedly stood up and returned. The courtesy of the halfling made him feel a little embarrassed. "My name is Kim Cali, everyone calls me gold!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "...a halfling?" Behan finally recovered from his surprise at this time. He couldn't believe the girl who leaned on him. All the questions now have an answer. A halfling rides an eagle, and their talented vision can observe everything on the ground from a high altitude. With such a scout, it really turns into a war without risk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, what's so strange?" Liz showed a flattering gesture. "Without his words, how could Dad make this choice?" We are now alone in the enemy's territory... Yes, Bush said hello to you, don't you answer?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dinner is over soon, and Bush and Liz use the five of them together. Although the halflings are only half of them, they must not eat less or even more than them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, what are you going to do?" Lisi asked, "Behane brother is of course going with us. What are you going to do?" Now the border of the Leite Empire is very tight, suspicious people will be immediately detained, and all private departures are not arrested or killed! It is difficult to sneak through the border!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But we have to go to the temple..." Alna was interrupted when she said half of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait a minute, I haven't said that I want to be with you..." Behan was a little anxious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You refuse to come back with me? Where can I make you angry? Don't you love me?... I thought this meeting was The arrangement of fate... I didn't think of it..." The girl looked at the man around her with a charming look, and let Behan suddenly plug it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't be like this, Lisi... I said, I have always been only a little sister..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you really have any feelings for me? I like you so much... don't go..." Liz didn't relax at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, okay... Anyway, we are all going through the border, we will be together before that!" Behan finally analyzed in reality. And succumbed to the soft language of women. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that our team of mercenaries is the only choice." Behan turned his face to look at other people. "I think that what we did in the city that never sleeps may be discovered. The attack of the soldiers of the Leites during the day is proof. Otherwise, they will not suddenly attack such a group of adventurers on the road. I have escaped, but I may not have such good luck next time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone exchanged opinions with each other and it seems that this is the most appropriate choice. Everyone remembers during the day, and the Reiter empire has clearly imposed a killing order on them. Acting with this mercenary group may be the least risky method. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is dark, very fast, except for a few points that are not attractive Attention to the fire, all the bonfires were extinguished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This team has a total of eight magicians, plus gold, make up nine. Nine people certainly cannot provide strong combat support, and their mission is simply to provide counter-measures against the enemy's reconnaissance magic. In general, the number of magicians in mercenaries is extremely small, and there are actually eight magicians in two thousand people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since other magicians simply met a face, Kim hurriedly left the tent and began looking for other partners. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because they joined the mercenary group, they were assigned to different places. After determining their position, Kim began to look for other people. What he really worried about was Wei, the dumb guy, and Erna, who suddenly came to this totally unfamiliar environment, and if something went wrong, it would be troublesome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A strong wind blew over, letting gold suddenly feel a cool cool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't move!" A voice came from one side, fast but clear, "You have a scorpion at your feet!" Before Kim reacted, that person It has already rushed up. The blade whizzed through the air, and the danger was wiped in front of the magician's nose, accurately falling to the front of his foot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ground is uploaded with a clear crack of the carapace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden turned and saw this person who came to help. The girl's body was hidden by the darkness, and the night was so thick that the sword in his hand looked like a bolt of lightning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is you, Lisi?" The magician illuminates a bright ball and recognizes the female mercenary captain in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yeah, you are called Kim, be careful, walk and look at your feet!" Lisi said indifferently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another strong wind blew through, and the long hair that the girl had covered was stunned. Kim suddenly stopped, and he looked at Lisi’s face with a stunned look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You...you..." The magician took a step back and was surprised to say nothing. The bright ball on the top of the head is still emitting soft light. Under this light, Kim sees the girl's pointed ear wheel that is significantly different from the human circular auricle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are..." Kim took a step back, because Lisi had begun to smile at him, "You are..." The magician tried his best to reluctantly Swallowing this mouthful of water, finally made a sound, "...high leprechaun?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Half..." Lisi replied with a smile, she clearly felt gold This nervous look is ridiculous. "Only half, I am a hybrid of humans and high spirits!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is more appropriate to call me a semi-fairy!" Lisi answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Half...leprechaun...?" Kim calmed down a bit and his speech finally went smoothly. To be honest, he never thought that he had a chance to see a high-level goblin—no, just a semi-fairy, but that’s almost the same—the race has almost entered the realm of legend. After the humans defeated them, the two races never saw each other again. The high leprechaun retreats so thoroughly that after the war of liberation, all people only know this race closest to themselves through books. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't be so surprised! You are also a magician! Be careful, I am leaving!" Lisi turned and left, leaving nothing to return. Magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, you are here, Kim!" Behan is in this way. Gold greets. The magician just took a lot of work to find it, only to find that Behan and Wei and Lev and Elna are together. "Sit down and discuss together! We are discussing how to find you, you are not in your own tent!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Find me?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, we should talk about what to do in the future!" Lev replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician immediately understood what was going on, although he did not expect this time to come, but after all, this is inevitable. Since the return of Undead Island, the common goal of maintaining them together is actually to evade hunting. Now that this danger has passed, the dissolution of the team is inevitable. Probably everyone has the same idea, so they are gathered here. Since it is a matter of time, it is better to discuss it earlier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The current goal is of course to follow this mercenary group across the border line, reach the temple of the goddess, help Wei to lift the curse! Then... what do you do? "The magician spoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is silent, no one answers first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to continue my journey!" The warrior spoke first, and his expression made people doubt the authenticity of his words. "I am going to find a way to defeat the Eight-Eyed Devil. Unless I die or win, this journey will not end!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am the same." Lev squinted at the magician. "There is no purpose anyway - I can't stop until I accumulate enough property!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I...go go home! Behan lowered his head and put a cup in his hand to pretend to be a careless look. "I have been away from home for six years... I have been a mercenary for four years, and I have two years of adventure... It’s time to go home and see it... To be honest, I’ve been looking for a chance to go back! Go back and see if the idiot dad is worried about my son. Since I am going to the temple... already close to home, I should go back again!" He looked up and smiled. "But maybe I will run out again, and I can't be a traveler!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, there seems to be a giant hammer falling to the magician. In the heart, the things in his original heart were driven away without a trace. A lot of things that were forgotten—no, not forgotten, but deliberately concealed—suddenly rushed up and occupied his whole heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I...you should go home first and see it!" Kim said slowly. "I also want to see my family..." When he spoke, his name suddenly came up in his heart, but he did not let them out of his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The actions of the mercenaries are very efficient, in the eyes of the air Under the guidance, they quickly withdrew from the interlaced zone of the hills and plains and began to further penetrate into the territory of Leite. In other words, now five people are going back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold is mixed in the team of magicians, who are the most cared for in the entire army. All the people are walking around - in order to save the horse's physical strength, you can always fight, but the magicians can sit in a comfortable carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This journey is very easy for the magician, but this kind of relaxation is not the whole of this mercenary career. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sixth area! Kim has completed some tasks! For this coming battle, all the magicians must work hard to prepare for the ambushing soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a hillside by the lake. One side is the lake, the other side is the mountain, and the road is sandwiched between the two. It is really an ideal position for an ambush. This road is the place where the enemy’s heavy troops have to pass. The intelligence in the sky clearly tells them that a large enemy is going to pass through here, and the number of guards is large. Lisi decided to come back for another ambush! The past series of victories has made the entire army highly morale. If you miss this opportunity now, you may not be able to touch it again in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers have been assigned and the magicians are working hard to set a barrier for them to prevent the enemy from scouting magic. With the eyes of heaven, their battles are simply taking advantage of them, and everything is in their hands. In the invisible place, a huge trap is open to the enemy waiting to be sent to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enemy's striker is still about two hours away from here. The time is still sufficient. The anti-reconnaissance magic has been basically arranged, and all the soldiers have completed. Camouflage and check, it looks like everything is fine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Completed!" Kim wiped the sweat on his head. Anti-reconnaissance magic does not actually consume much magic, but it is consumed in such a region and area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without warning, the air elves suddenly turned from calm to excitement! The magician was surprised to find the root of this change and suddenly found that he could not see the lake over there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole area is filled with fog, the fog is so thick, and even less than three steps can not see others! This fog is so sudden that it is unlikely to be an ordinary natural phenomenon. But this shouldn't be magic, because if you want to cover the whole region with "fog", then at least the level of the big magician is possible. The elves in the air are so excited that they seem to be drawn by what power. The magician stumbled down the hill and tried to find the source of this strange power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fog is very strong, the road can't be seen clearly, but this does not prevent Kim from continuing to search! This power is very strange, it must come from a certain source, it cannot be produced out of thin air. The magician is completely following the feeling, walking along the source of this power, slowly groping forward from the hillside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here!" This strange source of power is in front, and the magician steps up. In order to prevent it, he begins to prepare a defensive magic... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Plop!" With an empty foot, the unsuspecting magician was planted in the lake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold struggled to sit up and look around to find that he had already arrived in the lake without knowing it. Fortunately, this place is relatively shallow, otherwise it is more subject to him, but even then, Kim is now very embarrassed - his entire body sat in the water, all over the body is soaked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hahahahaha..." Loud laughter came from the air, accompanied by laughter, and a half-fairy girl appeared in the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How are you here!" Lisi reluctantly held back and asked. But the magician did not answer, he just looked at each other with his eyes straight. correct! Absolutely not wrong, the power that prompted the elves to be so excited came from Lisi, because Kim clearly saw the elves flying around Liz's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go back, the enemy is coming soon!" Liz quickly returned to her usual appearance, saying, turning and leaving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait a minute!" The magician shouted out, and the half-fairy girl turned back and looked at Kim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...this fog...is it made by you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes... ..." The girl's strange answer, the natural nature of the tone makes people think that creating such a wide range of fog is just a small thing that is not worth mentioning at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Using Elf Magic?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you do this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the day, a loud whistle was heard, interrupting the conversation between the two people. Kim knows that this sound means the enemy is close. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's talk about it later, hurry to your own position!" Liz no longer cares about the magician, and turned away and quickly disappeared into the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;辚辚The sound of the wheel is uploaded from the already invisible road and seems to be vague You can see the human form that happens by chance in dense fog. No jealousy, no noise, everyone is holding their breath waiting for the enemy to enter the ambush circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold in the trenches specially prepared for the magician, looked at the rest uneasy, although in fact he could not see anything. He has never been so nervous. He just couldn't feel it when he tried to set up magic protection, but now, once he calms down, he realizes how powerful his heartbeat is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is just a battle, an ordinary battle, just a little bigger than the scale I have experienced in the past!" Kim kept using this self-deception The reason to convince yourself. Although this reason is theoretically speaking, it is another matter at the actual level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold has not seen blood, nor has he seen a large-scale battle, but the current situation is completely different from the previous one. He also attacked the bandits in the dark with Ken. He also fought a desperate battle with the Orcs on the city. But this does not explain anything. He is very nervous now, and he is very nervous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is surrounded by a group of unfamiliar companions. In fact, apart from each other’s first introduction to each other, he has barely said a few words. They always have an exclusive attitude towards him, and there seems to be no topic to talk about. They all know his power that is not very commensurate with his age. The trainee magicians have seen his wand many times carefully, even if it can't be said to be full of envy, at least it is an envious expression. . Kim even felt that he was left alone in this army and was completely separated from his companions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The upcoming battle is also something he has never experienced before. The magician still remembers the tragic battlefield situation seen a few days ago. The fallen horses, the broken weapon shields, and the bodies that can be stacked into mountains, together in the sunset at dusk, constitute the infernal scenery that the people who have seen can't forget. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, that scene - if all goes well - will appear again in front of the magician, and will come with more, bigger scenes appear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a battle of self-defense, nor a battle under the name of justice, just a simple killing for money - and all mercenaries The reason for the battle is the same, for the sake of money to kill humans who share the same appearance and have the same bright red blood. There was no hatred between them before, no matter from the individual to the general, the reason for the fight was for money. And Kim himself is mixing in such an army. Perhaps the unique snoring of his big car loaded with heavy objects is mixed with the sound of one or two sounds that slam the animals. The enemy seems to have not found hidden in the dark. Murder at the place. It is no wonder that they are still far from the danger zone on the border. Now they are on their own roads, what are they afraid of? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden machinery turned his head and looked at another magician in the visible range. He is a little older than Kim, but the level is just a magician. He seems to be indifferent. He just uses an indifferent sight to find a dance that can't be worn at all. For him, everything seems to be numb. But through his indifferent sight, Kim still found his inner excitement, and a feeling of being covered up by power was hidden in this seemingly indifferent gaze. Kim clearly found that the other's robes hem in the absence of the wind are actually shaking slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This moment may be just a few minutes, but it seems to be a long experience than a century, and the enemy has already entered the carefully arranged ambush circle. Kim looked up at the sky and erected his ears. On the one hand, he wanted to hear the signal that the end of this unbearable wait and hoped never to appear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the signal finally came, and the sharp, piercing sound of the arrow on the arrow that was thrown out of the special hole suddenly rang, mixed with the sound of the wheel It seems so prominent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the arrow is only a moment, then suddenly turned into a dense snoring mixed with the wailing of one after another. The following is like blasting a pot, messing up into a ball. The commanders screamed and screamed, the chaotic response of the soldiers, coupled with the sound of the frightened and uncontrollable cattle and horses and the pain of the injured and the dead. The confusion at this time was not distinguishable by the golden ears. Kim only knows how short it is, and does not know how many lives have passed away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost every mercenary has a bow. Everyone prepares thirty arrows before the battle begins. At this moment, the so-called arrows are like rain. This blow was so swift and terrifying that it immediately disintegrated the entire organization of the enemy. At this time, the fog has begun to fade, but the field of vision is still not very good, and the sound is still the best guide. Some people distinguish the shape of the fog in the fog, but more people are looking for the source of the sound, the following enemies can not organize effective resistance, can only rely on personal survival instinct and the god of luck I am struggling to survive this rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original dense fog is now suddenly disappearing at an abnormally high speed. At the end of the first wave of the bow and arrow, the fog is already faded. Everything about the enemy is exposed to the ambush's field of vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kill!" I don't know who is the first to scream, but this voice immediately began to expand rapidly, the whole battlefield is this hobby The shouts of blood, the mercenaries jumped out of the hidden position and plunged into a chaotic, enraging enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold climbed up and leaned down on the edge of the trench. Except for him, everyone else has already entered the battle, and the magicians have jumped out of the trenches and started to launch the magic to the enemy. Although it is a single-digit magician, it has even more impacted the enemy's confidence in further fighting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle is one-sided. When they walk into this ambush without warning, the outcome is actually decided. Although the number of the Leite army is still a lot, they are not able to organize effective resistance at the moment. They are surrounded by mercenaries and eliminated in batches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The damage caused by the bow and arrow hits was very heavy. Within the scope of Golden Vision, there were no injured Leite soldiers in a circle, struggling to resist attacks from all sides. They are very tenacious, but this resistance is just vain, because they simply don't have a chance to win. The mercenaries blocked the ends of the road and then oppressed the remaining enemies to retreat to the lake. Even the gold that does not know much about the military knows that the Leite army is completely ruined. They lose their organization and are in chaos. Although brave, they can only be a messy spontaneous resistance, and they cannot form a powerful resistance. The only strange thing is that the soldiers of Reiter are extremely tenacious, and even in this case no one surrenders. Unfortunately, this does not change anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a single battle, this ambush can be seen as a perfect example, with no trace of mistakes from head to toe, gold Seeing that now, Liss is directing the soldiers to compress from the two sides, completely cutting off the enemy's escape route. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following battles are meaningless, because both sides already know what the ending of the battle is, now only one side stimulates the bloodthirsty fanaticism, and the other side Make the final resistance for your own life. If there are paths behind the Leites to escape, then Kim believes that they have long left their weapons and fled, that is, this sinister environment forces them to have no choice but to fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A feeling suddenly rushed to the heart of Kim, I don’t know what it feels like. Suddenly he thought of helping the Leite soldiers who were seriously injured but still stubbornly resisting. Or are they moved by their tenacious spirit, or just their own pity for the weak, or for other reasons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last moment is coming. The remaining soldiers of Reiter are now completely surrounded by enemies, and although they are reunited, it is already too late. The Leiter army could not escape this strong encirclement, and the soldiers stood in the waist-deep water, facing the repeated charge of the elite hiring cavalry. One soldier after another fell on the enemy's sword and horseshoe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wall of flames rises in the middle of the remaining Leite soldiers, and is driven by magic to burn on the lake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This seems to be the last blow to the intensive enemy, but Kim’s efforts to avoid the intensive places of the enemy, the force of the flames. This magic exhausted all his energy, but he also successfully completed his plan. He put the fire wall on the front side of the Ritter army, mixed with the mercenaries' offensive routes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of the fire wall, the mercenaries have to retreat, the two armies The central part is now out of contact, and although the fire wall has not reached the position, the battle continues, but soon, these battles have also stopped, because the boiling water vapor caused by the contact between the flame and the lake began to spread, and the field of vision was white. I can't fight if I want to fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呜..." The last trace of magic was released with this powerful magic, and the whole person fell to the ground and began to gasp. The energy consumption was too great. This subtle and thorough control was something he had never done before. Even in the illusion training on the Undead Island, it was really hard to imagine that he actually did it. The whole magic was completely achieved according to his wishes, and there was no mistake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden effort to look up and look at the battlefield below. As he thought, the flame was quickly extinguished after losing the support of the magic, but the huge water vapor caused by the fire and water still existed. The Leite army seized this extremely valuable opportunity, reorganized the lineup, launched an attack under the cover of water vapor, and tried to break through. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold looked at the situation on the battlefield, and the smile quickly disappeared from his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the direction of the breakout of the Imperial Army, a figure he is familiar with is fighting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the last swoop of the beastly beast, the enemy’s attack at the moment is fierce, The tenacity of fighting is unprecedented. This damn water vapor masks the enemy's actions, allowing them to concentrate on the superior forces at this point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behan’s heart secretly complained, but everything was too late. He must stand before the reinforcements arrive, otherwise the entire front will collapse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic didn’t know which guy was released, maybe it’s the guy who didn’t have much judgment on the war. This magic power is indeed great, but unfortunately not only prevented our army's offensive but also caused such a large range of water vapor. But what is said now is useless and must be kept. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle of the Leite army is desperate, their frontal enemies are too few, can not withstand the constant onslaught, and finally opened a gap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behan waved the sword in his hand and tried to kill the enemy in front of him. This moment is no longer a personal Wu Yong can reverse, the Leite soldiers rushed over, he did not even have the opportunity to pull out the sword of the earth from the waist - because the light sword of the earth is not suitable for fighting on the battlefield So Beyhan didn't use it in the first place in the battle - if he could use the power of the magic sword, maybe he could stop this wave of swooping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shield doesn't know when it was knocked out, there are no other comrades around, only the enemy, a steady stream of enemies! A maneuver was flattened, but there was no gasping time, and another enemy rushed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behan slashed his sword, but his hand was already exhausted. The sword was too slow and was blocked by the enemy with a shield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two spears emerged from one side of the shield, pointing straight to the chest, Behan reluctantly turned to avoid, a spear pierced, but another But he couldn't hide, stabbing his left arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It hurts, the pain of the heart! But there is no time to feel pain! The enemy on the front slammed him against the shield, and the huge impact forced him to collide. I didn't know what was going on on my feet. It was soft and unstressed. As a result, I fell down at once. When I fell down, I saw that it was a corpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Reiter soldier with the sword and the shield rushed up, and the unrelenting sword was cut and pointed at the throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sharp whistling in the air, and in a moment, the long sword that was being cut together was divided into two halves together with his master! The Reiter soldier didn't even realize the change. His upper body was out of the lower half, and when he fell in the lake, he was surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Behan brother!" With a familiar voice, the sharp whistling sound just came, the air was full of screams, blazing In this case, inflammation exerts a terrible power, and where the whip-like sword is, no one can survive. At this point, at least ten soldiers were cut open, and shields and weapons simply could not withstand the hot weapon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behan held up and Liss had already rushed to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This cruel killing made the Leite soldiers who rushed up and couldn’t help but be scared. The crowds of the crowd just turned into a lake full of blood. The floating body fragments, this scene is all pleasant. This temporary retreat gave their enemies a chance, and the mercenaries of the two wings re-enacted and blocked them again. Although the front was only broken through this short few minutes, hundreds of soldiers have already rushed out of the encirclement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Beihan brother, are you okay?" The girl turned over and asked about the swordsman who had struggled to stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter!" Behan tried to show a smile, then pulled out the sword of the earth at the waist. I haven't fought for a few years, I feel strange, I used to use the light sword of the earth, and other weapons are not very easy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cavalry! Go chasing the enemy right away!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is coming, everything is over, there is no sound on the entire battlefield, because the cleaning of the battlefield is basically completed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way the mercenaries deal with the bodies of the dead are simple. To treat the enemy, just dig a few shallow graves and pile the enemy's bodies in random. It’s a little more solemn to yourself, and it’s buried as completely as possible, but it’s relatively speaking, it’s actually very rough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ambush battle is very good today, to be honest, when they know from a few prisoners that they are ambushing today, the Realt Empire is known for its elite When the main force of the Third Legion, everyone felt a little scared. The total number of enemies is 5,000, but less than one hundred enemies escape from the encirclement, and this is the consequence of that damn magic. Otherwise, they can't escape even ten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mercenary also paid the due price for the victory, with a total of more than 500 casualties. With the help of such a perfect trap, they still pay such a large number of casualties. If there is no such sudden fog as God helps, if there is no such good terrain, then this battle may be completely different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no Leite army nearby. According to the conclusion of the eyes of the sky, even if the escaped Leite soldiers report to the police, the enemy wants to arrive here, at least four days. time. Lisi decided to let the soldiers take a good rest in this area. After all, the wounded on the road will inevitably affect the speed - since there are therapists in the army, there is no need to use them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician sat next to a pile of bonfires, watching the beating flames daze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no feeling in the heart, just that it is not a taste. Is it right or wrong to do it yourself? Kim doesn't know. He didn't know why he suddenly jumped out of his thoughts to help Reiter. In which way did he fight? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behan was seriously injured, maybe it was a minor injury, but what does it matter? He was injured and his responsibilities were in his boring sympathy! The war was like this. Both sides have weapons in their hands to kill people. There is nothing to be blamed for anyone to be killed. After all, is this death or death, and there is no compassion or compassion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold suddenly felt stupid, it was a pig, or even a pig. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you called Kim?" A female voice rang, and the magician looked up and saw Liz standing beside him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician was surprised, but stood up and followed the half-fair girl. Liz’s attitude is a bit unusual, and Kim makes a vague feeling of some bad feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The fire magic of today is what you put!" Suddenly jumped into the ear of Kim without warning, and scared him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The flame magic, you put it, you did it on purpose, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Not..." The magician instinctively wanted to say this, but when the words disappeared, he silenced and then answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fist is sturdy in the unprepared belly of the magician The whole body that made him hurt bent. This shot by Liz may not be very powerful, but this unguarded punch is enough for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You bastard!" With a drink, another punch hit his face. The magician's strong body was shaken, and he slammed back to the side, but this did not allow him to get rid of the blow. Lisi's new attack fell on his chest and knocked him all over the ground. This punch is so good that the whole person falls to the ground on the ground. "Why do you do this? Because of compassion? For your boring pity, we lost at least one hundred people! Are you not very capable? What are you lying down? Stand up!!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician climbed up, wiped the blood on his lips, and stood up again. The strike was strong and fierce, but his strong body still ate! The pain in the abdomen, chest and face, and the kind of unwillingness caused by a girl's beatings and contempt, or something else, left the shadow of his original heart without a trace. Kim was angry, or said, getting angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A prayer immediately jumped into the head, but he had not had time to start, the girl had already rushed up, and did not give him the time to meditate on the prayer, let alone the spell. It is. The fist fell on his face and body one after another, ruthlessly interrupting every effort he tried to continue the prayer. He was like a live target and got a skunk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heavy fists fell on the temples, and he hit a star in front of him, and immediately fell on his chin, knocking down the huge body of gold again. Ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Use magic, powerful mage!" The ironic words stimulated the only remaining reason in the golden dizzy, and he stood up again. Another useless effort was made. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold chose the fastest prayer, which takes only ten seconds to complete, but for melee combat, ten seconds is too extravagant. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician was knocked down again and then climbed up again. It should be said that Lisi's physical strength is relatively insufficient. If this time is done by Erna, the magician will not climb up for the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although so much, even though the face is quickly becoming a panda, Kim’s combat consciousness is still there. When the semi-fairy girl rushed up, he no longer chose to use magic that was absolutely hopeless, but instead used a fist to fight back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Liss lightly flashed through the clumsy attack of the magician, and it was a fist and a fateful hit on his lower abdomen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two started a close fight and then one fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician squatted down on the floor, blood and foam coming down his mouth. Every inch of the whole body, every muscle is wailing, and it is telling the hurt. His consciousness suddenly thinks of the adventure that has passed through the half-orc wilderness. Only then can it be beaten with this one. ratio. This result is taken for granted. Although Kim’s body is strong, although the opponent is a woman, how can a magician who has never been subjected to any fighting training compete with a veteran mercenary? Not to mention the previous attack that was received. The magician couldn't hit each other, and he was beaten from head to toe. Kim’s fighting ability is only enough to deal with the Breit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even the most powerful magician can't resist a dagger that suddenly stabbed around him!" When he was awkward, he seemed to wear it in his ear. The voice of Noubis. The actual facts of the Necromancer are proved. If you have prepared in advance, if you prepare the prayer or a magical body, then the outcome of this battle may be different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gold!Gold!" A voice came, but it was as far away as the other side of the sky. The magician made a vague response, and then awakened him with a violent shaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shakes of the candle light illuminate Behan’s face, although I have known each other for so long, but I haven’t seen his face so close. Then, Jin closed his eyes again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes are open again, because the memory has returned to the brain. Kim looked to the left and right, and saw Behan and the half-fairy girl standing behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Get up! It’s fainting when it’s done, it’s really useless!” the girl said unceremoniously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold sits up, but this action brings an unbearable pain, reminding him of the beat that he just had - this is not a fight at all, it can only be beaten - Not a dream, he couldn't help but make a painful embarrassment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Enough, Lisi! Go out!" Behan shouted loudly, his voice full of anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Beihan brother, don't you be angry..." Lisi spit her tongue. "I just talked about it... He didn't really fight... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go out!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Know...you don't be angry..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You're okay...Gold?" Behan looked at the magician's eyes, and asked with some concern. The magician noticed that his left hand was wrapped in a white bandage and hung around his neck. After all, there is only one therapist in the military camp. Only the seriously wounded who have lost their ability to act can receive treatment first. The slight injury like Behan is not the shot of Elna. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing..." Kim shook his head and removed his eyes from the glaring red spots on the white bandage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be angry with Lisi! She is just a straight girl..." Behan went on, but his words were interrupted because the magician Trying to stand up, the elbow hit the companion's injured hand, and he hurt his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter..." Kim took care of Behan's hand, and now it is his turn to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing... a little hurt..." Behan smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician let go of his hand and walked outside, and when he walked to the door he looked back and looked at Behan’s face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do not worry... I am not angry. She did not make a mistake!" The magician showed a smile. "I suddenly hate myself - when you are all While struggling, I was using a bystander attitude to look at the war..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold out of the tent and see the half-pretty girl standing at the door , looking at myself with a look that is not very friendly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It looks like you are awake!" said Liss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s awake!" The magician touched the still sour nose and replied. He did not hesitate to look at the girl's eyes now, and now there is no dangerous feeling in the shining eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am still me..." After leaving Behan’s tent far away, Kim gently said to himself. On the Undead Island, Nubis gave him training for a short time, and it was not enough to change one's habits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the spell, a small bright ball appeared on the hand, and by the illumination of it, the magician fell back into his tent. . The bruises on the body hurt. I used to have a therapist around me. I almost forgot that the wound will become more and more painful as time goes by. Just like a group of trusted companions always can get enough use for him. The time of magic made him forget the fragility of his profession. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now nothing is gone, because it’s obviously stupid to want to compete with the seriously wounded for treatment. If you suddenly jump out of the darkness, you will be killed. The enemies of the intention will not have a group of companions in front of themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
