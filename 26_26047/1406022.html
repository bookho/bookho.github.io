Slowly recalling the teacher's teachings in the past, then he found out how useful these things were when they were skipped by themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation at the moment is not terribly bad. Although they have suffered defeat and suffered heavy losses, this is not the fault of anyone. Lev and Elna are just gone, relying on Lev's dexterity and Elna's flexibility, they will not be dangerous. Behan was injured, but this is not a fatal injury. Overall, although it was an unanticipated result, it was not bad enough to be completely ruined, and everything was fine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s really interesting, and the whole situation looks completely different. The magician walked around the small camp casually, noting that everyone else was still asleep and didn't get up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician walked over the edge of the camp, where the rest of their poorness was heavy. If you save money, this small unit will probably have ten days of food, and it should be able to support it completely out of the enemy's sphere of influence. Just next to this batch of weights is the only sentinel they had at night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gold!" Wei greeted him, his spirit looked good, but the swelling of his eyes was obvious - this means that he did not sleep yesterday, or It is not good to sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After greeting, Wei reopened his eyes halfway. He seems to be somewhat abnormal recently. He always seems to be absent-minded. He always thinks about something, but Kim doesn't know why, and he doesn't ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold left here and walked to the left edge of the camp. He remembered that Behan was here last night. The magician knows that his leg has been injured. Although he does not have the ability to directly treat like Erna, he can achieve magical effects like ice compress, swelling and pain relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gold that was moving forward suddenly stopped, and he quickly found a place to hide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the spartan tent of Behan, the semi-precious girl is coming out from inside, and even from such a long distance, she sees the scattered clothes. . When you see this, everyone knows what is going on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behan also came out of the tent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is already dawning, when dawn is like a shy bride When he took off his black coat and finally showed a bright and moving body, Behan had already woken up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Liss still sleeps beside him, she seems to sleep very heavy, on the charming face, long eyelashes seem to have a teardrop. The man couldn't help but bow his head, his lips close to her plump, seductive red lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the lips took the initiative to welcome him, and he kissed him before he even responded. The semi-fairy who was sleeping was lifting half of the body and giggling and looking at the surprised man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have to take responsibility!" The girl suddenly changed into a tone, completely different from the atmosphere of the joke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behan stunned, he didn’t answer, just showed a smile, but this one laugh made the semi-fairy go down her head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dad..." She suddenly said so low. The happy expression just disappeared from her face, and the girl remembered the reality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong, Lisi?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do we do now?" Liss Suddenly looked up and asked Behan. "Daddy is dead, after the pursuit of the Lei Te Army, what do we do now? Dissolve as Dad said before his life? Disbanded... Domir, Latsey... They are all dead, is it all the result? It’s destined...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behan slowly sighed, the world’s things are like this. Along with the largest employers of the soldiers on the mainland, the Red Alliance was defeated by the Leite Empire and gradually became a dependent country. The mercenary business was doomed to be lost. Countries may maintain the power of a mercenary, but the larger, self-employed mercenary group that constitutes a group is difficult to sustain. Even if there is no defeat this time, but a successful escape, then the situation will not change much in the end. In addition to gradually disbanding his troops, Gary had no other choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your home?" Liz turned her face and looked at Behan, a surprised expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, my home!" Behan sighed again, really didn't want to go back to see his father's face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original dark cave is now illuminated by magical light, the whole magic The arrays are all shining. On those strange symbols, the blue and red rays are like the fireworks, the energy is once and again gathered, and the dispersion is repeated again and again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the magic circle, it is the magic book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body wearing a huge black cloak is watching this scene, the defense on the magic book exceeds his expectations. This door is mastered by a key that he does not know. It takes a lot of time and magic to open it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Every page is guarded by different forces...It’s really a good thing...hehehehe" The sage looks at his magical futile operation, But he couldn't open the defense added by the maker of the magic book, but he did not have any impatient or unhappy expression. Because he has time, and isn't everything under his control? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A crystal ball is now on his palm with a cyan scale, and the sage looks up at his magical array, then looks down at the crystal ball . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crystal ball is the camp of the small army. The sages searched in this place and quickly found his goal. He stretched out some kind of spiritual tentacle, tempted it on the sleeping magician, and then retired before the other party made any possible reaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s so good... really good...hehehehe...” The laughter like the frog’s scream in the box is not very big. In the cave reverberating, in the laughter, the sages put away his crystal ball and walked to the side of the human figure standing in the corner, full of steel, with a paw - not just a hand, called a paw It's a good fit - gently rubbing the head that is completely wrapped in the helmet, with only a thin slit to reveal the eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He will be more suitable than you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laughter sounds again, Reverberate in every corner of the cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Continental Calendar, the first hundred after the victory of the Undead War In the eleven years, in the central part of the lost continent, in the temple of the goddess of life, which is worshipped by human beings, people are busy preparing for the upcoming ceremonies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ritual originated from the famous prayer in the Undead War, on the eve of the decisive battle, when all the human leaders gathered here, for that almost hopeless The battle prayed to the goddess. The goddess also responded to their call. In the final battle, the magic of the necromancers was suppressed to a minimum, and they could only fight with the overwhelming number of superiors. The result was easily defeated by the dragons who arrived midway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since then, this temple has had the habit of three years of ceremonies. But the reason why this ceremonies receive so much attention is not because of its origin, but its significance for ordinary people is that at the ceremonies, the therapists will treat people for free. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Temple of the Goddess of Life is one of the most beautiful buildings recognized on the mainland. This building, once destroyed by magic in the dynasty war, has long been re-established in the ruins, once again becoming a spectacle, sang for the poets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the magnificent building of the shrine, there is a vast grassland called "The Garden of Leica", which is blessed by the goddess Withered, the flowers are in full bloom. It used to be the battleground between humans and the undead army, but now flowers and beautiful scenery have long completely concealed the tragic war. This land belongs to the goddess. In other words, it belongs to the management of the temple. No country or power can brave the anger of the goddess and put their hands here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a geographical point of view, the temple of the goddess of life is located in the middle of the Red Alliance, Delante, and Leite. Specifically, it is located in the territory of the Red Alliance and is close to two other countries. But here neither nominal nor actual, it belongs to any country and is completely independent. So when the temple declared that it wanted to support Reiter at all costs, the Red League and Delante could do nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was simply that Leif did not think of it all the way. When they finally left the mountains, it was already several days for the Rett army to withdraw the blockade. It should be said that their encirclement is very strict. After winning the victory, the Rite army mobilized a group of magicians. With the help of magic, almost all the fleeing mercenaries were arrested. In those days of hunting, the bodies that died on the noose had dozens of daily. . Only a handful of people, with the help of luck, escaped the ruthless search of magic and escaped. Lev and Elna are just two of these very few lucky ones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The news that the temple is about to begin the ceremonies has already spread, and a large number of people who want to participate in the ceremonies are coming to the temple. This year, there are more people than in previous years. Many people of course have got those intractable diseases. Those who want to take this opportunity for free treatment, of course, some are coming for the sake of excitement. However, more is a special trip to the pilgrimage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this environment where the situation in the country is tense and the war is on the verge of death, people’s hearts have long been scared enough. If you pray to the goddess for devout prayers, you may be able to move her to use the power of God, so that the war is so invisible. People gathered here with such a wonderful dream, but did not think of whether war and politics were the right of Leica, or whether she had any reason to intervene in this world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Erna Therapist's Gown is simply the most visible pass, leaving the two without any trouble along the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's beautiful!" Lev looked at the endless grass on the side of the road and sent out emotions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is called "The Garden of Leica", which is similar to the literal meaning. It is a meadow with a lot of flowers growing here. But unlike ordinary grass, the flowers here don't grow wildly—that is, long as beautiful as the lawn of a noble garden maintained by someone—and there are no thorn plants in such a large meadow. Such a pleasing greenery is dotted with countless flowers, and it is no wonder that Lev will admire it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bluestone road continues on this grass, just like a few inadvertently on the green canvas, but reveals the artist's superb art skills. At the end of this continuation is the temple and the bustling market. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two followed a cart that transported goods into the market under the shrine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The market is very lively. Along with the flow of people in all directions, merchants have gathered a lot here. It is itself developed by the temple to accommodate patients seeking medical treatment and the sale of some holy waters of blessings. It provides some free accommodation for travellers. But on the eve of the festival, it became a bustling city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two people are struggling in the flow of people, there are a lot of people, and the street designers probably didn’t expect to have so many people one day. However, in general, everything is still very orderly. After all, at the foot of the temple, people have a little bit of awe. Although the bargaining sound is endless, there are no unpleasant disputes between people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alna is very anxious, there is no saying on the road, and it seems that there is some restlessness, and the design scale of this market is indeed Not big, after a while, they finished the street and came to the steps of the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "God..." Lev sneaked a word. When he came here, he really felt the feeling of a countryman entering the city. The steps of the Temple of the Goddess of Life are not so much a stone as a heap of gold. The ten-meter-high steps are made up of black and white marble, and it is obviously magically modified to eliminate all the gaps and make the whole steps open like carved from a stone. Lev knew that there was no marble in the vicinity, and that he wanted to make such a step to be the base of the temple. God knows how much it costs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one is close to here, the ritual has not yet begun, and no one dares to break into such a place. Elna headed up and Leif was a little cringe, but she kept up with her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temple door is open, but there are two guards at the door. Both of them were wearing a white robe with a black hem of the primary therapist's gown, and the head with the decorative effect far more than the actual effect engraved with the eagle's long rod. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop!" Seeing the arrival of two uninvited guests, the two therapists staggered their canes in front of Elna, which looked younger A loud shout. "There is a rule that no outsiders are allowed to come in before the ceremony! If you are coming back from outside to attend the festival, please wait for two days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a new rule. Any therapist who leaves the temple cannot enter before the ceremony - that is, when the priests pray - so as not to disturb the sacred ritual!" The young point therapist continued to speak loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alna turned her face to look at another person, and then she asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Roka? Is it you? Don't you know me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... ...the above rule..." The man who was called Rocca squirmed for a long time and finally spoke up. He looked more weak than his companion, and even slightly feared the young woman in front of him. "The therapist who has left the temple...no...you can't go in...you can't go before the ceremony..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't leave the temple!" Na put on a arrogant tone, and Lev looked at him from the side and saw that Erna’s expression had become arrogant. To be honest, Lev never thought that this was always with a smile and humility, always This expression can be seen on the face of Elna, who is very polite to treat everything. "I just went out for a while, now I am back. In the name of the goddess, I command you to let go! You have no right to stop me from entering!" Her tone is such a strong, has overwhelmed the guard in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rocca took a step back, the tiny sweat on his head, and his companion looked at the scene with astonishment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But...Irna...the above is prescribed...now no outsiders are allowed to enter..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "I am not an outsider!" Elna reached out and tried to push the stick that was in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...The above stipulates..." Rocca made the last futile effort to block Elna. But his weak resistance attracted Elna's terrible look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you dare to stop me?" Erna said slowly, her momentum is so strong, her opponent can not breathe . From Lev's point of view, Elna is clearly in the forefront of the attack, and in the eyes of Rocca, Erna's face has become terrible, like a demon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am a therapist, and I have not left the temple, just travel back! Why do you stop me?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roka sent a helpful look to his companions, but their opponents were so arrogant that they could not find a place to resist. Moreover, when Rocca called out the name of Erna, his companion who had not feared because he did not know it also shrank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long stick in front of him was taken back, and Erna won. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leif saw Elna go in, he wanted to follow, but was blocked by the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong? He is my companion!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He has weapons!" Rocca pointed to a dagger with the following husband hanging on his body and a knife on his belt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Give them a custody." Elna hesitated, then said to Lev. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the rule of the temple, no weapons can carry Into the temple," Elna explained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lev reluctantly solved the weapons and gave them to the two people, then followed Elna and went in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why are we coming to the temple? Can't you go outside?" Lev finally asked. Although it is a good thing to get into the temple and open your eyes, I feel that the atmosphere of Erna always feels weird. Moreover, after the weapons that have always been carried away, they always feel a sense of loss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to take you to see someone!" Erna said as she walked, and pulled a column of jadeite that was inlaid on the door. husband. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A person?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interior of the temple is large, and after passing through the gate, it is a broad front hall. It was originally used to receive patients, but now it is empty because of the relationship of the ceremonies. Lev watched around, and the sides of the front hall were carved with bottled maids. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The semi-naked girl holds the water bottle in a different posture, while the clear water flows down from the bottle and falls into the sink below. All the statues are made to life, and the gentleness and quietness of the women are described in the hands of the sculptor. Although I don't know what keeps these statues flowing – it may or may not be magic – but this luxurious decoration is really awesome enough to rival any royal garden in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A painful snoring came and broke the picture that was originally perfect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the map, there is a place in the northwestern part of the Reiter empire, at the same time as the Red Alliance and the Delante, and near the Temple of the Goddess of Life. Known as the medium town of Studdin. When the Red Alliance announced its independence from Reiter, the two countries fell into a state of war. However, because each other does not have the strength of the other party, the war has been stopped and stopped until both sides have consciously established the buffer zone of Berek City to bring the end of this inconclusive war. And this Studdin is the product of that long battle. Studdin was ruled by the empire of the Reiter empire, the hereditary Count of the Fate family, but also one of the alliance cities of the Red Alliance. From this perspective, it is both a member of the Red Alliance and the legal territory of the Reiter Empire. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the city has not been so important, and the Reiter empire did not interfere with the whereabouts of this territorial mountain that has little value. As long as he also praised the emperor and paid the royal tribute to the royal family, they were satisfied. This decision was later proved to be wise. When the Emperor Victor re-swallowed the city of Berwick and provoked a full-scale war with the Red Alliance, Studdin became the natural shield of Reiter against the Red Alliance commercial blockade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it is the land of two hostile countries at the same time, Studdin is wise to adopt a neutral policy. The result became the only safe commercial channel between the two warring countries. The biggest threat to the Red Alliance is the commercial blockade of the merchants. Although there are sea routes and north-south traffic, the east-west traffic line will be cut off. And the presence of Studdin made this danger disappear, and the Red Alliance could neither attack him—because he was a member of the Alliance—and could not ask him to also use commercial blockades—one of the terms of the agreement signed that year. , retaining autonomy. Even if several big chambers of commerce join forces to blockade, it will not prevent small businessmen from continuing their business through this route. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stodin has become a safe haven and a golden nest in the war, and the continuous commercial traffic has guaranteed that Leiter is not threatened by any blockade, but also The vitality and wealth that the city brings. It can be said that Stodding was the biggest beneficiary of this war. Moreover, when the two countries talked about peace, it was also the Count of Fatt who was pinning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now they are outside of Stodding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first they faced almost a battle. Stoddin sent an army to deal with such a cloak, which looked like a robber. If the leader is not recognized by Behan, this meaningless battle almost broke out. However, until Behan was called "the young master" by the leader, Kim knew that this swordsman who had been adventuring with them and did not have any aristocratic temperament - at least not in the golden eyes - was actually a nobleman. Although the nobility's concept of gold is like the concept of sharks for cats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next thing is going well. Everything was arranged very smoothly, and the mercenaries were taken to an air force battalion outside the city. Everyone had a good meal after a shower. And while others started their first peace of mind for many days, Behan came to the city with four other people to face the scenes that he didn't want to face but inevitably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Berhan brother, why have you never mentioned that you are actually an aristocrat?" Lisi asked as she walked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yeah, I have never seen you mentioned." Kim also asked curiously. An aristocratic child would actually go to be a mercenary and then be an adventurer... it’s really incredible. Although the aristocrats are very common in order to let their children increase their knowledge and let them go on a trip, it is rare to see them. The swordsmanship on the battlefield and the World of Warcraft in the adventure journey, but do not know the difference between the nobles' bloodlines and other people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behan’s face was very tweaked, and these questions made his face change for a while, and he finally answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The group soon came to the most luxurious building in the city, in front of the Earl's Mansion. The servants had received notifications and arranged in a row at the door to welcome the team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Beihan brother!" Liz asked a little bit softly and asked Behan "Your father will... will you accept me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!" Behan smiled a bit. "It will be... he will take this opportunity to laugh at me..." This sentence is very light, let Lisi fundamentally Can't hear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold is a little nervous looking at the servants around. Although they are servants, they wear all the uniforms. Gorgeous embroidery and fine silk were laid on the bodies of these respectful benders, so that they finally realized that their magician robe was dirty, old and broken, and they just wanted to find a hole to drill in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the clothes on their party add up, probably not as much as the value of the cuffs of any of these servants. But it’s just that these well-dressed people respectfully welcome these cloaks. This scene cannot be said to be not a satire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pedestrian walked into the house, a chunky, bald man who looked like he was about sixty years old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the count?" Kim looked at the man a little, but couldn't find any intersection between him and Behan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Young Master... You are finally back, Master!" The old man came over and opened his hands - but he hugged him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah!" The gold in surprise made an instinctive dodge action, letting the old man rush. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Uncle John, I am here!" Behan spoke up, and this voice made the old butler discover his own low-level mistakes. His presbyopia is more serious than before, so that he can't even recognize Behan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Young Master..." John hugged Behan, tears in his eyes. "You have been fine in these years. I have been worried about you all the time..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Uncle John, I am very good, rest assured!" Behan also Hold the old man, "How is his father?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The lord has always been very good. He has always cared about you."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Caring about me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, he is paying heavily to the adventurer's union to buy your situation... these years It’s always been like this...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Oh! Isn’t this a young master?” A voice rang and interrupted the conversation between Behan and the old housekeeper. Four people looked up to the source of the sound, and a woman in a bright red dress was walking down the design's cleverly rotating staircase. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This woman is about twenty-five and six years old, and she is very beautiful. It is a fascinating beauty. The red dress set off the enchanting figure, and the delicate and delicate facial features match the almost perfect makeup, so that the semi-fairy can't help but feel a little self-defeating. Her existence is like a magnet, and the tangible and invisible attracts the man's gaze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I haven’t seen a few years, and the young master has grown a lot!" The woman walked over to Behan and touched Behan with her hand. The breastplate then glanced at several of his fellow travelers. "Mature is much more!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't be like this, twelve! Is Dad upstairs?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes!" The woman walked past them, walked out, and answered inadvertently. "He is waiting for you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the woman disappeared at the door, Kim immediately asked Behan, "You just called her twelve.........here... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," Behan answered with a smile. "She is my father's twelfth wife... my father has a total of fifteen wives..." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah..." This exclamation was sent out by three people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master, the lord waited for a while!" John said to Behan, "It is better to go see him, your friend. Let me say..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behan went up the stairs alone, and there were some ups and downs in his heart. He didn't know how to face his father. The rumors that he said when he left home were still echoing in his ear, so that he could hardly afford the courage to face his father's ridicule. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it has been slowed down as much as possible, but this way is still very fast, he came to the front of the facade, smashed his heart and reached out Just go and pull the door handle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hand stopped when the hand touched the handle, and the woman’s slight laughter from the door—and more than one woman—clearly arrived at Behan Ear mask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Smelly old man!" I don't know where it suddenly rushed up to this anger, let Behan a foot - from here he, his feet recovered a lot, You can stand on one foot - open the innocent door. "In the daytime, what are you doing? Is this the attitude of waiting for the son to come back?" The sound of the voice probably spread throughout the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chair sitting in the middle of the room is indeed the Count of Fat, Owen Fart, the father of Behan. He is nearly 50 years old, but he still looks young. If you and Behan are standing in front of people you don't know, I believe that they are brothers more than people who believe they are fathers and sons. Of course, this also has the reason why Behan lived for so many years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Behan Gate entered, the Count of Fat was surrounded by four women. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing such an angry son coming in, these women all stood up and walked toward a side door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, little master is jealous...hehehehe" The last woman disappeared in the side door with this voice, and now there are only two fathers and sons in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Bad boy! It’s still so arrogant to come back after so many years!" The father’s voice was no less than his son, and the two were almost arrogant. “Don’t dare to blame me?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “I’ve never ignored me for so many years, what am I going to do?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "This is a mistake..." The father laughed. "I can tell you what you know about life. You see!" He reached for a pick up from the table. The paper that had been prepared for a long time shook it to Behan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The list of women you've worked on over the past few years! Very Long, a total of more than twenty-five... plus the one you brought back, a total of twenty-seven! It seems that except for the therapist who has been traveling with you for two years, you have gotten the other women who are in contact with you. "The count is proud of the declaration, let his son's face burst into red." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Smelly old man!" Behan rushed up and pressed his hands on the table in front of the count. "Don’t use this sloppy word to pull me and you. Together, your woman is at least twice as much as me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, my age is more than twice your age!" The look of his son. Although many wives are very common among the nobility, it is rare to have fifteen wives. No, it should be said to be unique. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You..." Behan’s anger ended, and he couldn’t say a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room was temporarily silent, and the father and son looked at each other and could not hear each other. But after all, it is the father and son, and the eyes of the cockroaches have slowly softened in this silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You look a lot, when you went out, it wasn't like this!" Father reached out and touched his son's face, Behan's weather-beaten face Let his age look a lot bigger than the actual one, and form a clear contrast with the well-maintained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't look really old at all!" Behan's tone is still ironic, but it is already very small. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't say... I'm ready for dinner... Go eat first..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"But...I have already eaten..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...well..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leif looked around in amazement I want to find out the source of the sound just now, and then the sound came again, let him clearly grasp it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned to look at Elna and found that she was also amazed, and it was clear that this uncoordinated voice came from this place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go and see!" Ellen had not spoken before, and Elna spoke first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people walked along the source of the sound. The voice came from a door, the door was wide open, and no one guarded it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A row of casualties are lying on the ground in an irregular queue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are all serious casualties, and the sound they hear is from the wounded mouths of these wounded people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How can anyone rule?" Elna said with surprise. It is not a strange thing to see so many wounded people in the temple. It is strange that although there are so many wounded people, no one therapist is treating them. Although it is the eve of the festival, it is not too busy to get to this point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the care of these wounded, only two children who did not wear a therapist’s gown looked fourteen and five years old. Their help to these wounded people can only be limited care, and it does not make any sense for such a serious injury - and two people take care of the fifty or sixty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alna went forward and asked the two busy children - they were obviously apprentices, and they were still far away from being a therapist. "What about people? Why didn't anyone give them treatment?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know..." The child who was pulled by Erna answered innocently "We are only responsible for taking care of them, others are not very clear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alna let go of her hand, she also saw it, from these young apprentices I can't ask anything. However, this is too unreasonable. So many wounded people have been placed here, and there is not even a person to treat them. What is wrong with the temple? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Alna!" Lev’s cry came. "Come and see, this person seems to know..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alna went over and looked at the man in front of Lev. He looks forty or fifty years old, is relatively thin, and his face is now extremely pale, but it is really vaguely revealing a familiar feeling. His injury was very serious. A huge and terrible wound from the chest to the lower abdomen was partially removed from the bandage, revealing the red muscles that had turned from the wound. Not only that, but his ribs also clearly broke a whole row, perhaps piercing the internal organs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I remembered! This guy is Dick's magician...that is the guy who was defeated by Wei at the contest!" Lev shouted Sounds come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice alarmed the man who had been tortured by the cavity. He turned his face and looked at the two men in front of him without a god. He tried his best to move a little and seemed to want to talk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't move!" said Erna, "You will be fine!" She reached out and untied the magical bandage technique. Bandage, then put your hand on his wound. Elna began to use healing, her hand was shimmering and slowly moving over the big wound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you..." The man tried to make this sound, but Leif immediately made a ban on him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief clearly looked at the whole change. Under the treatment of Elna, the original whitening wound turned red obviously, and the depth seemed to be slow. Slower and lighter. The pain has obviously eliminated a large part, because the wounded's face is already much more beautiful, and the eyes seem to glow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay!" After about half an hour, Erna retracted her hand, her face did not change, but some gasps slightly, and her forehead appeared. A little sweat. "It has temporarily stabilized, and it has already stopped the pain. Repeated treatment for 10 days should be fully restored."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are a magician... How is it here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We were defeated..." The wounded showed a bitter smile, "Dico's The Northern Expeditionary Army was completely annihilated... The Orcs and the Dwarf Coalition defeated us completely... Only our magicians escaped, and all others..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is defeated? How come back?" Lev almost cried out, and he still remembers that the news he got was that humans had a successful victory in the first battle and they are marching smoothly! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...It’s terrible... After two consecutive harassment of the damn half-orcs, we finally met their main force. They are The northern part of the wilderness meets us... We have an advantage. The number of their goddess pastors is too small. There is no way to protect the whole army. We will take the opportunity to attack their rear... Everyone, from top to bottom, thinks we are winning. But the land behind us suddenly collapsed... The dwarf army rushed from there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dwarf?" Lev immediately remembered that night. Locke did not say goodbye... Old Locke lied to them! He took the gems but did not return them to the dwarf! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes...the giants first rushed out of the tunnel, they were all draped, waving a terrible hammer in their hands...you can put one The cavalry was smashed into patties... and our soldiers’ weapons could not cut the thick and outrageous armor! Then the damn lions... These winged guys flew over to us, let us take care of ourselves, there was no way to support them. The soldiers who were beaten by the giants...and then the dwarf infantry in the sacred silver armor...and their terrible war tools...the victory was reversed..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man said and said, actually began to cry out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The land under the feet is constantly collapsing...we are completely confused...no one can care for others...there is chaos everywhere...the generals... Uh... I watched him surrounded by the Orc King and his Guard... but we can't do anything... oh... those half-orcs riding monsters suddenly appeared next to us, and I squatted a few times. ...we repelled them...but nothing is too late...our army has been completely disintegrated, surrounded by all the enemies...we can't save ourselves except one..." he said while sobbing, Crying is as sad as a child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So how are you here?" Lev asked after his mood stabilized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who is! Dare to listen to the order!" An angry voice came from outside, accompanied by cluttered footsteps. A group of people rushed here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The place where the wounded were placed was a group of therapists, led by an old man wearing a white robes in Phnom Penh. He looks dry and thin, and his anger makes the face that is otherwise unflattering even more ugly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who is using therapies!" The man yelled and saw Elna. Suddenly, a gloomy hatred enveloped his face, but he was immediately hidden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's me!" Elna stood up and looked at the old man. Even Lev, who knows nothing about the relationship between the two, has already seen from the expressions of both sides that there is absolutely no happy past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why is there a wounded person who does not treat it?" Erna asked aloud. "Even if there is not enough manpower before the ceremony, you can’t let the injured person This lies here! This is contrary to the will of the goddess!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The goddess also warned us not to forcibly retain the life destined to die!" The old man Loudly retorted, "These wounded people have not been saved, treating them is just a pure waste of power..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who said!" Elna pointed The wounded person who has recovered after him, "Look! How can this kind of injury be said to be saved?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man walked forward and went to love In front of Erna. He is half a head lower than Elna, but the release of the eyes is a superior light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What qualifications do you have to question my judgment?" The old man held out a finger and pointed hard at the primary therapist in front of him. "What is your qualification for this primary therapist to question me!" He no longer relies on the fact that it is obviously untenable, but directly lifts the disparity between the two sides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elna stared at the old man in front of him. From the perspective of Lev, the eyes of Elna had turned into a burning fire. Under such a gaze, the old man unconsciously took a step back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It looks like you are not convinced..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are too much... Lev couldn't stand it anymore. It was a naked slap in the face, even if a casual punk on the street was ten times better than the old man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alna clenched her fist and relaxed again. She reached out and made a posture that prevented Lev from speaking, then grabbed her robes. In the eyes of all the people, she tore the black side of the robe, revealing the original Phnom Penh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alna’s movements are very fast, not much time, the black side of the whole piece of clothes is torn down, and now she is the same gold side as the old man in front of him. White robe symbolizes her same status as her opponent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now? I am now qualified to raise my doubts! Now I ask, why are these wounded untreated?!!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alna proudly raised her lips and looked at the old man who was shaking with shyness in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are the devil's daughter!" A vicious curse flowed out of the old man's mouth, making Alna's face instantly become white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You..." Elna clenched her fists, but the man brought by the old man came up from both sides and formed a siege of the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two sides are so stunned, the atmosphere is very tight. The therapists in the temple are almost all boxing fighters. Although they are bare-handed, the danger is not much better than the sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened?" A majestic voice sounded at the right time, interrupting the smelly scene of the gunpowder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An old man wearing a white robes in Phnom Penh came in from the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This senior therapist is about sixty years old, tall and well-rounded. There is a kind of kindness that is unique to this age, which is made up of white hair and wrinkles, and there is a kind of majesty that is full of maze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There was such a noisy before the ceremonies? What happened?" The old man glanced at the film. "What happened to so many wounded people? Brado, I remember you told me that the wounded in the front hall had all the treatments completed... Also, I wish I was wrong, and several therapists actually had to fight in the temple!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When his eyes swept, all the people in contact with his eyes bowed his head and dared not face it, including Elna. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Auxiliary ancestor...this is for a reason, you listen to me..." The old man whispered, not daring to face this newcomer Eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait a moment to explain, treat the wounded first well!" The old man who was a supplementary sacrifice came over and said in a sly tone. He didn't look at the old man and went straight to Erna. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am very disappointed, Erna!" He slowly said to Erna, "I always thought that you are a smart, excellent, self-restraint Girl, but I actually saw today that you want to use the power that the goddess gave you in this sacred place to swear to the goddess... I am really disappointed!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I'm sorry... the teacher of the law..." Elna whispered softly, but Lev on the side could not stand it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a minute! How can you blame her? You have to see clearly who it is..." Lev’s words were not said to be half played by Elna. broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don’t say, Lev! This is indeed my fault!... This is the temple, the temple of the goddess of life... The conflict here is equal to The goddess of the goddess...especially the therapist who should be observing the goddess of dogma..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come with me, Elna." The tone of the law is relaxed. A little, turned and left, Elna and the overwhelmed Lev followed her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
