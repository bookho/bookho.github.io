Wei called the name of each of his partners in turn with his inaccurate voice. Now he is beginning to have a sense of reality that can speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Young warrior, what is your name?" Xiu asked Wei Fa, and he knew that he had succeeded from Wei’s reaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wei! My name is Wei!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Really called Wei? The old magician was taken aback. He thought that he could not speak because he called the wrong name. Xiu Ke has a lot of knowledge, he knows what the name Wei means. When Kim introduced him to this warrior, he thought it was a similar pronunciation, and did not think that he really called Wei. Later, after discovering that he could not speak, he took it for granted that this was an error in sign language (Wei's sign language is really not very clever). But now, Wei confirmed his name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name Wei is a taboo name in the barbarians. No one will give this name to the child because the name has a special meaning. Only those who swear to revenge for the professed themselves, those who want to avenge their loved ones, in order to strengthen their convictions, he will abandon his original name and rename it Wei. The old magician knew this, and he also knew how much hatred of a dark continent would abandon the name he was proud of. This young man has more things to carry than they think. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not your real name!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes! My original name is... I have forgotten that I can't remember it until I avenge my loved ones!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sure!" the old magician secretly said. This is the second time he saw a person named Wei. The last time I jumped into the magma and attacked the burning lizard that was sleeping. Although a sword cut the head of the flame lizard, it also disappeared into the thousands of degrees of magma. But the old magician couldn't forget the expression of his reassuring satisfaction that he finally showed. Until now, Xiu Ke still did not know whether this behavior is brave or crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Young people!" The old magician said to Wei, "You'd better take a break now. The magic is eliminated, but the effect will still exist. First, talk as little as possible. After four or five hours, there is no problem at all!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We nodded and repaired and knocked with the wand in my hand. The crystal ball, Wei's body immediately disappeared in this room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden eyes widened: "Teacher, this..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You thought I was this Didn’t there be any new discoveries at that time?” repaired with a smile and answered, “This is—if I am not mistaken—the space manipulation ball used to carry out traffic during the Holy Light Dynasty can be transmitted freely within a short distance. The distance can be located and transmitted. The only drawback is that it is too easy to be disturbed, just use a magic to make this thing useless."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Na Wei..." Lev’s words were not finished, and the old magician interrupted him. “He is now in the lounge I have prepared for the guests! Rest assured!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Grandpa, I... can I visit this place?" Babe looked up and said, for her, came to the tower - obviously there are a lot of fun things - but only Sitting at this table and drinking juice is really a bad thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, Babe. I am not the legendary evil wizard, there is no harm in my tower! (Except for the door and one Outside the magical statue of the building) Just pay attention not to break my book when you go to play!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the babe jumping outside the room When I ran, the old magician said to other people: "Everyone, although it is not very good here, I believe that you are all here for the first time! Please visit me casually. I have something to do, let me go! Please feel free! Come with me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two magicians stand up and walk upstairs, others are curious to slowly visit this legendary tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher, what?" Kim asked as he walked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes! This time we think of Undead Island, take the boat through here, so I want to bring everyone to see you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go to Undead Island?" The old magician frowned and his face sank. To be honest, even if he is, he dare not go to the ghost place. What is the necromancer? He is familiar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How much confidence do you have?" Asked in a serious tone, he knew that his apprentice might not be able to return. But before Kim answered, he went on to say, "Forget it, let me try your level. If your strength is not much better than when you leave here, I won't let you go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You should know where Undead Island is, if there is not enough strength, Going is nothing but death in vain, adding a few soldiers to them! Well, we are here, this is what I want to show you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In front of Kim, it is a very complicated magical array, emitting a kind of power. Kim looks at this magical array. He feels very familiar. He remembers where he saw this thing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This...this is a magical array of different spaces?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes! I It took a long time to find this stable alien space... How do you recognize this magical array?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I visited Raymond Sol More, in him, I have seen this magical array!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Raymond?...no wonder. He did not expect that he has found a stable space crack ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Space crack? Is this magic array not making alien spaces?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Made? Do you think that you can do this kind of thing with the power of people? Ah, I understand! The luck of Raymond is really good! I met a stable alien space at the beginning, so he misunderstood this magic. Make magic in different spaces! Hahaha, Kim, you listen to me, making things like a space, has been separated from the human ability, only God can do it! This magic The power of the array is to connect an existing space crack. I tried more than 30 times before I found a stable space crack. And Raymond probably succeeded once and again. Well, let's not say, let's go in. "!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold followed the repair into the crack of this space, although there has been similar experience, but Kim is still amazed by this strange world. They are there in the void at the moment, nothing, except for the two of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Seeing no, I decided to use this as magic Driving range! Very good!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“A driving range as a magic?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now let me test your strength and see if you have the possibility to come back from Undead Island! If you are not qualified, I will not let you and your companions die!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two magicians stood face to face at a certain distance, although for Kim, this is not the first time to compare with the teacher, but at this moment he is still nervous. Old Locke once told him that as long as he can master the magic control ability, he can play twice as much combat power, but can he really get the teacher's approval? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Begin!" Although this is said, there is no movement in the repair, he has to wait for Kim to start. As far as the true strength is concerned, the difference between the two masters is the same as that of the ants and the buffalo. If the magic is applied at the same time, then the gold has no chance at all, so every time the test is done, Kim can first recite the mantra. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold while thinking hard about the strategy of fighting, began to meditate on the prayers. If he wants to pass this test, he must do what Old Locke taught him! He sent a fireball to repair it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Old set!" After the fireball was issued, the big magician began to construct defensive magic, he used a "defense of the star" ordinary defensive magic (this magic The characteristic is that almost all of the attack magic is more or less defensive. After repeated repairs, it can withstand almost all the attack magic that Kim is good at. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The repair had to end his magic, but he had already completed four overlaps, and the fireball exploded in front of the protective wall. Although the gold attack was excellent, it was impossible to play a substance on his teacher by a double-overlapping fireball. Sexual threats. As soon as the flame burning on the protective wall is extinguished, the repair will immediately counterattack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great Magister prepares a "binding" when the flame burns on the protective wall (the action of the other party is forbidden at the spatial level, the dark wind uses this Magic), although this magic is a little scary for Kim, but if there is no way to resist even the advanced magic, then go to Undead Island to die! Because the flame blocked the line of sight, it is impossible for Kim to see his movements, and he will not be wary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the flame burning on the protective wall has not been extinguished, the young magician has condensed almost all his power before the trap of gold is understood. When he got up, he knew that it would not work in the face of a long-term battle in front of the teacher. Instead of slowly consuming the power on the defensive magic and then failing (as it used to be), it is better to try it with all the strength. His first magic was just to gain time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s really good to combine the heat in the fireball! It’s really good!” Knowing the gold tactics, he first made himself unexpected and could not build enough defense walls. Then mix the coke wave into the fireball (the pyro wave is a fire column with a magical energy itself, the flame will not go out before the magic energy is consumed, it is suitable for setting fire), then, gather A powerful magic to break the defensive wall of your own strength. "But there is a mistake. If the magic wall is weak, I don't have to fear that my magic is blocked by my own wall. I can attack it directly without first removing the wall!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;第02节<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Electric coil gust dragon" Jin called, this is a mixture that Old Locke mentioned - no, it is fusion magic. Although Old Locke did not elaborate on this magic, Kim has mastered this magic with his own research. (Fusion and blending magic are fundamentally different. Mixed magic, such as the previous gold put the coke and the fireball together, actually want to read two spells. And the fusion magic has the power of two magic, but it has It's a new magic, just use a spell, just like the thunder of God.) This magic is very powerful, with the strongest tornado of the wind system and the power of the electric shock illusion of the electric system, but consumed The magic is also amazing. With the magic that Kim now possesses, the power he uses to use this magic is less than half the power of this magic. This is all based on the teachings of Old Locke. Kim now not only enhances the power of magic, but also reduces the power of magic to reduce the consumption of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the two hands of Kim, there is a tornado with electric light. The rotating tornado, which is about two meters in diameter, tightens the lightning that should have been shot everywhere. Surrounded by tightness, forming a lightning column. This magic uses a tornado to bring together the scattered power of lightning, which can penetrate any magical defense with insufficient power at one point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isolated by the flame, I can't see what magic is used in gold, but he has already launched the attack with his prepared "binding". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tornado wildly swept over, and it could have played terrible destructive power, rolled up everything it touched, and sent them all to destruction. In the lightning column, fortunately there is nothing in this space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the four-fold "Guardian of the Stars" can't resist the powerful electric shock that gathers at one point, even if it is ten heavy, it can't resist, then the lightning is like a piece of lightning. The electric snake, which spoke the first letter, broke through the obstacle and rushed to the old magician. The three other defensive magics that the old magician prepared in advance for safety were all broken. The repairer who was a big magician couldn't resist it under this sudden blow. The flame that burned on the protective wall isolated his sight and made him underestimate his disciple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thunderbolt slammed into the body of Xiu Ke, the entire body of the old magician was immediately swallowed by lightning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge explosion happened and the old magician floated out like a piece of paper. When he stood up, his magician gown had almost become a cloth hanging on his body. But there is no time to feel bad about his clothes. This dress is made in the same process as the one on the gold hand. He has a lingering memory of what he has just experienced. Without this robes, he would definitely die under the terrible magic of the apprentice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the opposite of the repair, Kim has been completely unable to move, and even his eyes can not turn, his teacher’s attack just arrived when he magically. Originally, he did not leave the power of defense, not to mention the magical time when a magician was weakest. His teacher hit the hand and completely subdued the gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kim felt that the power to suppress himself had disappeared, and he can now see the consequences of his own magic - the repaired clothes and the burnt belt tears have been ruined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher! Are you okay?" Kim hurriedly stepped over to help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing! Older, not arrogant! How do you use such a strong magic in this kid? Want to take my old bones apart?" This is said to be done, but there is no anger on his face, but instead a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will help you to go back and take a break!" Kim also saw that the impact of the electric gust dragon on the teacher was not small. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No need!" The old magician patted the shoulder of gold. "You have performed very well. I now agree to go to Undead Island! However, in Before you go, you have to learn this first! See clearly!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cultivate your right hand and burn a magical flame on his palm, gold I can't understand the very common flame of this group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You see it clearly!" With the sound of the repair, the flame began to change gradually, and the original red flame began to slowly turn white. Slowly, it turned into a transparent pure white, as if it were a burning light. Exudes a sacred flame of light, people instinctively feel that which bears some kind of divine power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is called Holy Flame! It is special for the undead. flame magic! What spell does not need to read, as long as the power of the gods of light to focus in any fire spells can be generated, but need to focus a lot of attention to be successful, but also superb ability to control magic to reconcile two forces The conflict. When the Holy Light Dynasty, the human magician used this to expel the Necromancer and drove them to Undead Island! Try it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold Effort I want to produce holy inflammation, but he has almost no magic now, and there is no way to concentrate even one of the most common flames. The repair saw this and put a hand on his shoulder and passed the power he needed into his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Close your eyes and imagine controlling your power with an invisible hand!" This is how Old Locke taught him to control his magic. Now Kim also It was because of this that when he opened his eyes, he had already formed a group of holy inflammation on his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold surprisely looked at the things on the hand, the face of the repair also showed a gratifying expression, his disciple’s performance is indeed enough to satisfy him, he himself It took three or four days to control the holy inflammation, but Kim was mastered so quickly. (This is the difference between teaching and self-exploration)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You listen, try not to encounter the Necromancer. If you can't escape, you should be careful. If it is a ghost mage, it will be attacked by Holy Inflammation. If it is a mage master, it must first break his outer defense by other companions, and then burn his body with holy inflammation, but if you encounter a zombie mage, then you must escape. With your current strength, it is impossible to confront the zombie mage!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(The human magician will be transformed into a necromancer because of the level of magic Become a different Necromancer. Ghost Master is the weakest, they will lose the whole body, leaving only a similar and dark shadow. The Ghost Master looks like a black mist. The power of the Master is stronger. They can partially retain their flesh, but usually only leave the skeleton. The mage looks like a sergeant with a surface that is covered with faint light. The zombie mage is the strongest because of them. The great power, their bodies are completely preserved, and they don't seem to differ much from an ordinary human being, except that there is a layer of obvious black gas on the surface. Most of the ghost wizards are converted into great magicians, while the zombie mage is All are the formation of the big magician.)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When lunch, everyone regroups Together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How about this tower, is it fun?" asked Beibei, who was very happy, he paid considerable attention to this little girl, not only because of the cute Beibei. And he can feel the powerful mysterious power that Babe has on his body that he can't judge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well! Very fun!" Babe replied. She originally wanted to say that there was nothing surprising, but her father taught her to be polite to the old man, so she only lied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wei! What do you think? Is it comfortable?" Jin asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Very good, there is still some pain in the beginning, but now it is completely gone!" Wei put down the tableware and remembered his own when he wanted to gesture. The sound has recovered. Because the dumb is too long, he can't speak very smoothly, although the pronunciation is already very accurate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Young warrior!" Xiu also noticed Wei’s performance. He suddenly said, “Is it willing to talk about your past? I can see what you are carrying. Say it will make your burden lighter..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher!" Kim said loudly. He knows that Wei has always been reluctant to mention his past, and Kim knows that it is cruel to let a person recollect what he is unwilling to think of (although it has been a long time, he has been reluctant to think about the village of Noor). . The vague vague know that Wei lost all his loved ones in that misfortune, and suffered much more than himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't matter!" Wei said with a gesture. "As Master Shukke said, maybe I will say it will be better!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 03<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone put down the tableware in their hands and began to listen carefully to Wei’s story. Wei slowly said that his pronunciation is very clear, but the whole sentence is not very good, often intermittent. Even so, as time went by, everyone's heart was slowly invested in what he said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When I was five years old, it was 975 years to convert to the lost continent. In the dark continent of my hometown, humans have gained a great significance. Victory succeeded in defeating the invading rat. This victory has enabled humanity to lift the threat of the rat since then, and has gained a peaceful life of nearly fourteen years. Most of my life is in this rare life. I spent the peace.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In my ten years of age, my teacher walked into my life. He is a lost soldier in the mainland. I don't know why I came to us and I plan to spend the rest of my life in our tribe. He is very powerful and can even beat my uncle easily. At that time, all the boys in our tribe worshipped him as a teacher and studied martial arts. However, after three years, I will only be able to stick to it. Maybe it is talent, the teacher once told me that people like me have nothing in the world. Only I have endured all his tests, and others who have been with me have withdrawn from study.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my seventeen years, new threats are coming again. On the head of human beings. A large number of Warcraft suddenly gathered in close proximity to the human domain, and an unconventional long-term occupation of a fixed site. They quickly caused a very large threat to humans, and many villages adjacent to the Warcraft area were attacked, and several tribes were completely destroyed. The king understood the threat he was facing, and he decided to summon the army to destroy the Warcraft. In addition to leaving the necessary warriors to defend themselves, all the adult men are concentrated in Wangcheng. In my village, all the young people are collecting! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At that time, I was too young, I didn't even think about what would happen in the future!" I have bid farewell to my mother and my teachers and all my loved ones with my dream of making a success. Together with those of my age, I am elated to go to Black Cloud City. At that time, I saw my future very simple, or returned from victory, with all the honors and pride of a warrior and reunion with relatives; or killed the battlefield, sacrificed for the country, at least will not humiliate the reputation of our family. People in my hometown think that I will be their pride, and my teacher is full of confidence in me. He told me that I am already the best fighter. In the whole world, there are only a handful of people who can overcome me! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We stopped, he seems to have fallen into deeper memories, as if to relive the best life of that life, recalling the ambitions of the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We have a group of people who came to Wangcheng. We are not too early to come. There are already many first comers. But among all the people, I am the strangest one, because I am wearing the armor that the teacher gave me! Because the king will give us uniform weapons and armor, no one except me will wear heavy armor to hurry. Everyone looks at me with strange eyes. Soon, my dress will bring me trouble. ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We stand on the square outside the city, for more than ten years Peace has increased the number of human beings. At this moment, this square is too crowded with people from all over the place. People are so much, Wei and his partners are simply unable to squeeze in. They I had to be like the other latecomers, and now I walked around the square.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to do?" Wei's words are very welcome. In his hometown, no one of his peers dared to talk to him like this. Everyone knows the power of Wei. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing to do! Grandpa just can't get used to wearing this, I want to give you a lesson! If you know each other, take this armor off! Otherwise let You see the greatness of the uncle!" A tall guy stood in front of Wei, although Wei's man is quite tall, but the guy in front of him is at least two meters tall and very strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Want to fight?" Wei did not move for the other person's body. The people on both sides stood in a circle around their leader, and both sides had confidence in the strength of the leader. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a great!" A heavy punch slammed into Wei’s face, but Wei caught the other’s hand and the two started to work harder. I want to push the other hand down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strength of the big man is not small, but as the teacher said, Wei’s power has reached the limit of the human race. His companions knew that Wei once dragged a six-ton ​​Warcraft back home (although with the help of the slopes), and he could immediately go up the mountain to cut the firewood used to burn World of Warcraft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei Lili pulls - a young man like him will of course be happy to show the limelight - just like pulling a piece of wood and letting the other's arm bones pass Out of the crack, he opened the opponent's already weak hand, a boxing hit the opponent's lower abdomen, let the big man squat on the ground like a mud in the eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe I am too young, I am very proud to watch The amazing and awe-inspiring eyes around me! Now I want to come, I was really stupid at the time! The family of the guy who was seriously injured by me was very background. They kicked me out of the stormtroopers in retaliation. I ended up being the most ordinary soldier. I felt very lost at the time, because an ordinary soldier meant to me to be insulated from merit and glory. With my skill, let alone be a member of the stormtroopers. It’s not a strange thing to be the captain!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “After a few days, after the army’s formation is complete, we’re going to start! Before the departure, the king gave a speech. He announced a promise that all young people were excited. He wanted to marry his second daughter, Carol, to the soldier who built the greatest feat in this battle. Although I didn’t know Kairol at all, even what she grew up with. I don't know, but, just her princess's identity, I can form an irresistible temptation for me who is full of vanity! I will go home with the princess in everyone's cheers - this is probably all the young people who can't help the world. The common dream, not to mention my vanity is much stronger than the average person!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I am just an ordinary soldier, I know that I don't have much chance Express yourself, I can only lament the injustice of fate!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After a week of marching, we arrived at the edge of the Warcraft infested area. The news that everyone has guessed is that a demon is manipulating these Warcraft - this is the most normal reason for Warcraft to violate conventional activities - the demon has been seen, he has scales and has eight eyes. Everyone calls him an eight-eyed demon! He lives in the center of the World of Warcraft area, inside a cave called the Devil's Nest!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although the front The stormtrooper team has opened Divided into small teams to attack World of Warcraft, but we soldiers can only watch behind. The King fears that Warcraft will suddenly launch a large-scale attack, so command all the troops except the stormtroopers to defend. I can see those fundamentals every night. It’s not like my guy is bragging about how much Warcraft he solved today, but I can only spend time in the camp without doing anything. The desire for honor has stunned my mind, I made the most wrong Decided, I want to kill the Eight-Eyed Devil by myself! I simply think that even if I fail, it is just a death, but I forget that the demon is a race with intelligence higher than human beings, and it is a cruel race that is fun of killing... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We used the silent footsteps to climb down from the rock, he was in a downwind, So those who are sensitive to smell do not find a human climbed down on their heads. Wei Ping’s training was also the reason why he could succeed without alarming Warcraft. Even in this dangerous terrain, he still could not make any noise. The night masked most of his whereabouts, and he finally circumvented the Warcraft that blocked the road and sneaked into this huge cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cave should have gone darker and darker, but the deeper the Wei found, the brighter the cave. He finally saw the reason for this strange phenomenon. In the deepest part of the cave, three huge crystals are emitting stronger than the sun. Light, and the figure he is looking for, is now at the center of these three huge light sources, he seems to be doing rituals! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hiding in the hidden place Wei observed it for a while, this light is very bad for him, he is obviously exposed to the outside, if you immediately rushed up, then The odds are really small. Instead of launching a courageous and positive attack, it is not as effective as a disgraceful sneak attack. Wei quickly found the right place, which is a stone hole in the center of the rock wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are hiding in the cave of the stone. He clasps the sword left by his father with both hands, nervously waiting for the demon to pass under him. According to everyone's statement, the power of the devil comes from his eyes. If his sudden sneak attack can't kill the devil, at least he must lick his eyes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 04<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The Eight-Eyed Devil is staring at Wei with his remaining four eyes, and the remaining four eyes are left with only four eyelids dripping blood – this is the result of Wei’s first round of attacks. Wei never knew that the demon blood and human beings were the same red. Just now, Wei flashed the attack of the devil's blade-like claws, but the devil hit the head with his tail. Although it was wiped, it was enough to make him feel dizzy. Of course, Wei’s long sword added a scar to the devil’s tail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One person and one devil have been fighting for five hours. The current situation seems to be very beneficial to Wei. There is not much wound in Wei, and the size of the devil. There are already hundreds of wounds. But the devil did not seem to care about the wounds on his body. He gave a scream, and Wei Quan was alert, because he knew that the devil would launch the next round of attacks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demon rushed over with the roar and opened his arms to Wei. He did not seem to fear Wei’s sword and vindictiveness. Unprepared swooping, but Wei also knows that as long as he is hugged by him, it must be fierce. Wei Xiangchong, after sending the sword to the chest of the demon king - the position of the human heart - after passing under the right arm of the demon king, the sword was pulled out and brought a wave of blood. But the tail of the demon king swept away again, and Wei forced a roll on the ground to stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil is approaching Wei, although the huge wound that Wei just caused to him is berthing, but he doesn’t care at all, he doesn’t seem to have Pain, it seems that the blood is not flowing at all, so many wounds, so much blood, did not affect his agility and strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why don't you fall?" Wei screams desperately, although Wei's physical fitness is superhuman, but after five hours of life and death, he is already exhausted at this moment. But the speed of the Eight-Eyed Devil in front of him seems to have not slowed down any more, even faster than the beginning. Everyone told him that the source of his eight-eye demon is his eyes, so when the demon king is not ready to launch a sneak attack, Wei focuses the attack on his eyes, but now the devil who lost four eyes has no exhaustion. Signs, on the contrary, losing the eyes only increases the wrath of the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where is the deadly point of the Eight-Eyed Devil? All possible parts of his body were baptized by Wei Na's vindictive sword, from the most inconspicuous tail to the most conspicuous head, all possible places have been tried. The neck was opened halfway, and the three sword holes on the head were still bleeding. The more than ten sword wounds in the chest dyed the cyan's cyan scales red, and the lower abdomen's eyes were smashed. Although the demon has a strong vitality, this kind of injury is enough to kill him three times, but the eight-eyed demon in front of him is still alive, and where is the deadly part? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil rushed again, the speed was much faster than before, and the extra movements were much less. Obviously, after such a long time, he came The more accustomed to hand-to-hand combat, backed by infinite physical strength and incredible vitality, the devil is rapidly learning and progressing in battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei retreats, now there is only one place in the devil's body and there is a whole piece of flesh. He knows he must take risks, his vindictiveness is almost gone, and If the long sword does not add vindictiveness, it will not open the skin of the magic king full of magic scales. He condensed the last vindictiveness on the sword and prepared for this final blow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Front, tumbling, passing through the devil's armpits, the demon king is too big, and has not turned back to swing the sword to the devil The backbone. The long sword broke, and in a flash Wei felt that the devil did not move! "Successful!" The ecstasy came up. In the short-term paralysis caused by joy, Wei did not come and escaped the tail swept by the devil. The power of this sweep can knock a cow to the ground, and Wei is just lucky to have broken a few bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei saw in the middle of the demon that the devil aligned himself with one claw and read two words: "corrosion", and then a black gas sprayed himself from his claws. This is the first and last time magic in the battle of the Eight Eyes Devil! This black gas immediately entered Wei's body, which can slowly devour Wei's flesh and blood, let him die in extreme pain. Wei felt the pain coming from all the weak places in the body, and the pain that seemed like a knife and a knife smashed his semi-conscious mind into a complete coma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know what happened, when I woke up, I found myself lying on the ground, the last blow of the devil did not kill me, but I lost the ability to speak, and the joints of the body also became particularly stiff, especially the knee joint, hard and almost no way to bend However, as far as the situation is concerned, I am already very lucky. After all, I survived."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I go out if this time When I met a Warcraft, I was dead, but I didn't touch anything. When I got to the military camp, I realized that the Warcraft group had migrated to the West under our attack. I was still in a coma in the Devil's Nest. In two days, the war has ended in victory!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After being injured, and for three days without reason, they took me Out of the army - I know that my sign language is very bad now, but at the time my sign language was even worse, no People can understand my explanation, and even if I understand it, I don't think they will believe it - I have no choice but to go home without honor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "But, when I finally arrived at my hometown, I realized why the Devil did not kill me! Because he wants to retaliate in the most cruel way! When I arrived at my village, the devil just ended his killing. What? There are no people left..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei’s fist grips tightly, and the eyes flash with the light that makes the observer feel scared, his breath Short-term, the words have not been able to continue. After a dozen seconds, Wei’s emotions were calmed down. The following content is no longer needed. Guess can guess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let me help you! Wei! Let me help you destroy the eight-eyed demon!" Kim now understands why Wei’s usual is like this, if the most important If all the family members are lost, anyone will become like this! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will help you too!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am the same!" Everyone makes the same Representation! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a minute!" repair interrupted everyone. "You said that you attacked almost all the monsters with the Elf Repellent method. He still has nothing to do?" For the old magician who has lived for more than 80 years, the pain in the world has already seen too much. He did not think of the young people, but carefully considered the demon in Wei’s account. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elf exclusion method????"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is what he calls vindictiveness! The accumulated life energy discharges all the existing elves to achieve the purpose of immune immunity! It is almost the same as when moving instantly! As far as I know, the Elf Repellent method is an effective killing method for any creature, because it is excluded. The elf can also exclude the other's life composition (even the demon's ability to recover, there is no way to recover quickly when attacked by vindictiveness), the demon is no exception! It is absolutely impossible for any demon to do this unless..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, this is impossible!" Shuo gently said to himself, he said the voice of this sentence is very light, no one can listen to . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher! What are you talking about?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No! Nothing! Maybe the demon uses a certain One way to concentrate life, as long as there is no attack on that point, there is no way to give him a fatal blow!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the lunch, the old magician took everyone to his library and asked everyone to flip through the information about the Necromancer. This adventure is too dangerous, let everyone know that their opponent's information is always good! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the Necromancer, everyone knows that it was in the Light of the Holy Light, but with the dynasty war, almost all the early information has been lost! The most recorded now is the record of the Necromancer in the Undead War. However, this kind of record is too one-sided, so although you have been looking for a long time in the books collected, you can't find much useful information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You should go find the dragon! The dragons came to the world in the midst of the Holy Light Dynasty, and the dragons played with the necromancers in the Undead War. They must be very clear about the weaknesses of the Necromancer!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dragon? But how do we go to find the dragon? The Dragon Island is too far away from here!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "You are very fortunate, just in the north of the town, there is a dragon! He was hired by a businessman four days ago, and now he is waiting for someone to take him back! And, you can fly directly on him. Go to your destination! This is much faster than taking a boat!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Six people hurried to the north of the town together. After listening to the words of repair, everyone thought that it was not too late, to go to the dragon earlier, and he was hired by someone earlier. So everyone said goodbye to the old magician and rushed to the place where the dragon was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 05<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragons are a special race on the lost continent, they are the only A race not made by the gods of this world, but from a different world. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the 326th year of the human dynasty dynasty, it was the heyday of mankind, the rapid development of magical civilization, the maturity and stability of the political system, and the unprecedented power of mankind. In the north, the interior of the half-orcs separated by the half-orc wilderness is still slain. In the south, all the land has been incorporated into human rule. In the West, the Forest Alliance has surrendered to humanity. Except for the dwarves hidden under the earth and the high-level goblins who are alone, the entire lost continent is human. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this time a very important thing happened, just one day in 326 (the specific time is not testable), a magician (the specific name is no longer available) The test suddenly found a distorted phenomenon in the space above a city on the east side of the mainland. After this matter was announced, it attracted the interest of the government. They sent people to investigate. But the results of the investigation have caused panic, and some power is coming from the unknown world to the world. That is, there is some kind of powerful force (perhaps a creature) trying to come to this world, and In the near future, this power will come to this world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the face of this unexpected thing, the whole human beings acted, they gathered all the power, determined to fight with the invaders of the outside world. Just as humans and their allies are waiting, the dragons emerge from the passage of time and space, and more than 1,400 dragons have come to the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world of the original life of the dragons has perished, and only a handful of dragons have used their powerful power to open the boundaries of time and space under the leadership of the elders, and they have embarked on a long journey. On the journey, try to find a world where you can live. However, they did not expect to have a wise race in this world that has been painstakingly discovered, and they are looking at their survivors with hostile eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a limited amount of contact, humans certainly couldn’t dispel their hostility (this, any race is the same) and they launched an attack. However, after a long journey of time and space, the hunger is exhausted, the weak and weak dragons have no way to fight, and they are forced to surrender to humanity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After capturing all the dragons, there were two kinds of opinions in human beings. One was to kill all the dragons and to eliminate all the troubles in one fell swoop; the other was Leave them behind, because such a race should have value for use. Finally, the decision was made by the Holy Light (all the kings of the Holy Light dynasty were called the Holy Light). He took a fancy to the dragon's enormous body and flying ability and decided to leave them behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The human and the dragon have set up the "Dragon Covenant", the covenant is unilateral, the dragon must obey the command of the Holy Light dynasty unconditionally (note: it is the light The dynasty, not humans, was then placed on a desolate island that was later called the "Island of the Dragon." However, fortunately, the dragon is very much in line with the life here. They live in the huge caves of the island and feed on the fish in the sea. In the Holy Light dynasty, although the original purpose of the magician to leave the dragon is to use them as means of transportation, but with the invention of the "space manipulation ball", the dragons rarely come in handy. This situation continues. It was the demise of the Holy Light Dynasty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the demise of the Holy Light, with the deep contact between the two races, humans gradually realized the power of the dragons and began to fear this race (in fact, not the dragons, But humans are weakened, and the Dragons have always maintained a position of not engaging in any disputes (unless they are called by the Covenant of the Dragon). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to their love for illuminating objects, the dragons often use labor and fish for gold and gems. Merchants often hire dragons to help them transport goods and people. In general, the dragon will not attack humans unless you have violated the following: 1 Try to attack a dragon. 2 trying to steal a dragon's collection. 3 Try to get close to the baby dragon or dragon egg. 4 trying to violate the agreement reached with the dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold meditation on the side of the "Healing Notes for the Dragon" Quickly ran to the valley where the dragon is located, but in fact he is not necessary at all because the dragon he is looking for is now sleeping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a black dragon with a black-gray agate-like scale. When Kim saw him, he felt where he had seen this sleeping position - the dragon was rolled into a ring, four claws were placed under the belly, the wings were attached to the back, and the head was just buried under the tail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before, the adventurers discovered the dragon's hugeness - the dragon's body length is at least forty meters (including the tail), and the weight is small. There are also thirty tons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!" Kim doesn't know how to wake up the dragon, but he knows that the dragon's senses are very sensitive, he should have his own voice. The reaction "wake up!". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long Hao opened a small eyelid - he is now sleeping. Although he has been waiting for the people who hired him to wait for the anxiety, but once he finds someone coming, he immediately pretends to sleep, so that you can put on a look that doesn't care very much, in the upcoming price negotiations. Get more bargaining capital (this is all about the fire) - he looks at this human with one eye, and he decides when he wants to sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!" Gold shouted, "Wake up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What, You woke me up!" Black Dragon gracefully removed his tail and raised his huge head, facing the gold. He deliberately yawned, revealing a lazy spirit. Black Dragon is trying hard to pretend that he hasn’t slept enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said! You should be hired here?" Lev took a step and said loudly to Black Dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes! But I am not in a hurry, I have not rested enough!" It should be said that the performance of this dragon is very good, but Lev I used to deal with the most treacherous animals in the world, so I intuitively knew that Black Dragon was too artificial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have something to look for, I want to know something about the Necromancer!" Kim said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Necromancer?" Black Dragon is interested. The reason people come to find dragons is mostly to transport goods and people, and to need some special magic processing, rarely for What information to find a dragon to discuss, not to mention the fact that this person actually wants to know the situation of the necromancer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why do you want to know about the Necromancer?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because we are going to find some The information of the Necromancer, and the Dragons should know more in detail, after all, you have fought against the Necromancer!" Lev staggered the topic, he did not want the dragon to know that they were going to the undead island to take risks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have lived for five hundred years, I have participated in that war! But, I don't know much about the situation of the Necromancer, about them, I I don’t know much more than you! If you want to know about them, you should go to the oldest dragons. Right, you should go to our elders! He should know the things of the Necromancer, and know it in great detail! "Black Turtle said to the people in front of him that he was a little disappointed. The other party did not seem to hire him. However, he is trying to change this." When they spoke, the adventurers had all come to the dragon, and the last one was Babe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon glanced at them and tried to find a breakthrough, let them answer the money and ride him to the Dragon Island, but this is the eye, his eyes are fixed a place! That's the baby behind Bebe (this is why Babe is slow)! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The calm and happy bargaining sentiment was swept away, and the fury rushed into the dragon's head. A human being dared to abuse (????) his younger family. In a different world, the dragons know the necessity of unity, no matter which dragon will not look at a young dragon. The black dragon made a murderous battle. His wings began to thrash, and his body was supported by four claws from the pile of golden stones under his belly. He was about to start fighting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
