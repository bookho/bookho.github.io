			<div id="content">“Where have you been hiding in the past year?” The emperor deliberately used “you” instead of “you” to talk to his daughter. In fact, you don’t have to think about it. together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Always with him!" Melia sees through her father's word game (after all, father and daughter), she does not make a positive answer, but put this The problem was pushed to her husband. In any case, the two most important men in her life always had to face-to-face communication once, which could not be avoided anyway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor stunned the man next to his daughter. Before the couple came to see him as a father, he was first sent a certificate of their marriage. The ten signatures prove that the couple's combination is legal, even if it is not moral (elopement), at least legal. Even the emperor himself had to admit this reality - that is, the two men in front of him are already a couple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, we have been in the suburbs, oh... ah... no, the father!" After being slammed by Melia, Edward finally revised it. A language error that almost appeared. Although the husband has already had mental preparation in advance, but after all, it is still a little nervous, and almost went wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is your father called?" The emperor replied unceremoniously. The man abducted his important daughter, and now appears in front of himself, and shamelessly calls his father. This wandering mercenary, this low-status person, has become his own son-in-law! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why not?" Melia stepped forward and looked at her father without fear. "He is my husband, you are my father." He said that you are wrong with your father? Or are you not thinking of me as your daughter? If that is the case, we will leave here immediately! The purpose of our visit is to let you be inside my stomach. The child takes the name, if you don't want it, then forget it!" She spoke neatly and said everything she wanted to say in one go. Although she is a princess, the wildness inherited from Melia's blood and the education of the princess she received are far from each other, and even can be said to be contradictory, although she used to try to cover up this in the palace. Rebellious character, but in the emotional impulse, her nature will be exposed. Now that she has passed outside this time, her nature has grown further. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything went very smoothly, three people circled next to the military camp, in magic Under the impetus created by the division, the pale yellow powder was sent to the big house from an open window. Soon, the powder was silently filled with every room in the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It should be ok!" Lev estimated the time. The effect of these powders was personally tried by himself. If you suck this kind of thing, even if you Just a little bit, I will immediately be called by the sleeper, and I won’t even wake up. But for the sake of safety, he took out a piece of damp cloth and put it on his nose, slowly slipping into the barracks, while his two companions were waiting outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without much effort, Lev came out from the inside, far less careful when he entered, and Behan and Kim knew they had succeeded! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let’s let those janitor fall asleep!" Lev said excitedly, but Kim poured a cold water "How do you let them sleep?" "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Use this!" Lev shook the bottle inside his hand, there was a small half bottle of powder, and four people plus two dogs. It is absolutely enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But there are two dogs, we can't rely too close... If you use the wind to send the past, then you can't do it. The space is too big. The powder can't be there at all!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...What should I do? It’s here, I can’t just forget it!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't matter!" Behan spoke. He had pulled out the sword of the earth. "They have only four people after all. If it doesn't work, we can also use force." Solve!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have not previously disregarded the distinction between status and status, Have you married your mother? You don’t often boast about this in front of me? But the same thing has been transferred to your own body, but the character has changed, but you can’t accept it. You can’t understand that others are bound by rules. But you use the same thing to bind your daughter!" Melia said all the words in her heart, if A year ago, she was definitely not for Nicholas so to speak! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's go! How do you say something about me and your mother!" The emperor stood up, as if the anger was about to erupt, but then he sat down like a leaky ball. Like all fathers with similar experiences, the emperor finally admitted that he had failed. The girl’s foreign minister, Melia’s heart has been placed on this stinky boy, even if it is too late to break up! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait a minute, we can't use force!" The magician made a block Gesture, "Once they give an alarm, the alarm must be more than the soldiers in the military camp. Other guards will arrive soon. In that case, our plan will be finished!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What should I do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have a good idea!" The magician replied, the idea suddenly appeared in In his mind, he took the bottle with the remaining half a bottle of powder from Lev's hand. "In fact, we don't need to approach, as long as the bottle is close!" He said, he put the bottle inside the handle on the ground. "It's okay to blow the bottle to the maximum distance that can be reached with the wind!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Under the waves of the wind, the bottle slowly rolled to the door of the warehouse, the magician concentrated all the spirit carefully Control the spirit of the wind, and his two companions looked nervous bottle slowly approaching the four guards. "This distance should be ok!" Lev said softly to Kim. Although a bottle is a very inconspicuous thing, if the distance is very close, it will still attract the attention of the guards. The magician stops the manipulation of the wind. He has sweated on his head. On the one hand, the wind can blow the bottle. On the other hand, the guy who is watching the door will not be suspicious of the strength of the wind. This wire is really hard to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A vacuum blade is silently close to the ground, easily cut the bottle that is not strong, and then another wind blows, hypnotize those The powder roll is for those who have no feeling at all...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man and the dog are slowly falling down and falling into a sweet dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four people came to the front door of the warehouse with ease. The door was lined with a total of four keyholes. This is obviously the kind of four keys that must be simultaneously The type of door that the work can open. But the adventurers did not spend any effort on the door they couldn't handle. With the power of the sword of the earth, a passage from the underground to the interior of the warehouse was quickly formed. This is actually the biggest reason Lev brought Behan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three people are divided into two groups, two people drilled in from the ground, and the other one re-hidden in the darkness outside, quietly observing the outside situation. Behan held the sword of the earth in his hand. Whenever someone came, he used the power of the sword to signal the people inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then we will leave! Father!" Edward bent over, With the guidance of Melia, he knows a little about the court's etiquette. Although his tone was calm, his heart was full of ecstasy at the moment. Everything was better than two people expected in advance. The bad things in those expected did not appear. Nikolay acknowledged their relationship and did not raise any martyrdom. The problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay!" The emperor waved his hand weakly, but when the couple returned and took a few steps, the emperor suddenly remembered what it was like. A cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Melia, let me stay, I have something to talk to you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Two people turned their heads. Edward looked at Nikolay on the throne and looked at his wife. Melia gave him a head, so he went out first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miliya..." The emperor stepped down to the throne and walked to the front of her daughter. She had not seen each other for a year, but her daughter looked very good. The face is ruddy and the eyes are fascinating. "I have been worried about you all the time. I really didn't think you actually stunned the two guards to escape!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is God who gives me courage and strength! "Miliya remembered the situation of the escape at the time. Now I think that I am really bold, and I can figure out that way to escape." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Servant?" Melia showed a look of horror, but then she smiled. "Father, I am your daughter, no matter where I am, I will have a good time! If there is nothing else, will I retire?" Saying, did not wait for the emperor to make a clear statement, The skirt rushed to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor reached out and made a gesture to pull his daughter, but it was recovered midway. At this moment, his heart suddenly felt a sense of emptiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The hateful stinky boy actually took my most important pearl from my hand! Wait a minute, I want you to give me a lifetime of life. Repay!” The emperor held his hand and issued a threat that was not a threat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people drilled out of the hole in tandem, Jin Xian Climb up, then stretch the hand below Lev! A heavy punch hit a magician who was bending over and unprepared, his body was directly flew out, and the magical statue that made this punch was chased forward at the speed unmatched by the same kind. Every action made a loud noise, enough to wake up the deepest guards sleeping in the military camp outside - of course, sleep under normal conditions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s an ordinary magician, this punch can almost kill him, but Kim’s time can’t climb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜...I didn’t think there was this last layer of guards...but there’s no time to think about it, the magic statue stepped over with its semi-metal half The weight of the body of the stone, this foot is on the ground, and Kim is not losing half of his life. Lev rushed up from behind, and he slammed his shoulders against the body of the statue. The magical statue of one foot and the ground could not be well balanced, so he was lost by the human being who did not have the weight of one tenth of it. Focus on this foot is right next to the magician. However, Lev also smashed enough, although he saved the magician, but one of his arms could not be lifted for a while, and he also turned the attention of this magical guard to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold finally got up, he still feels dizzy, this treasure It is two layers inside and outside. The exit of Behan’s cave is in this middle layer, and the statue soldier patrols in this mezzanine. Lev is making a thrilling hide-and-seek with this guard in this narrow mezzanine. Obviously, this statue is specially made, and its speed and flexibility are much larger than ordinary goods, but there is still a gap compared with people. Unless it is forced to a dead end, Lev will not be hit for the time being. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Magic Statue... Use magic to bring together a large number of elves into a well-formed body to make it actionable, irrational, slow-moving... as long as Destroying part of the body will stop the action...but the defense and attack power are very strong and it is difficult to be destroyed..." This is recorded in the current magic books, and it is also the usual understanding, only with heavy weapons or powerful Magic can destroy them, but now two people don't have heavy weapons, and it's impossible to use powerful magic. In such a small space, if the thief hits, it will be finished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't fight against forces that you can't compete with... What you have to do is interfere with the direction of the power, minimize the damage!... The power of magic To be flexible, if you can't judge and control it freely, you don't need to use magic at all!" The swearing in the illusion training was passed to the mind, and the magician suddenly thought of a bold thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical statue is still chasing the thieves who are hiding from the west. Didn’t find gold rushing from behind, the magician approached from behind, and put it on the hand without any difficulty. The back of the magic statue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Middle the movement of the elves...the statue should lose its ability to move! Ordinary interference is useless, but if it directly affects the inner elves..." He did not use any magic, he just whispered a few prayers, let the elves blended in the statue be influenced by him...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright took back consciousness from this hexagonal crystal, and in his meditation, part of the memory and knowledge entered his mind. Integrated with his memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a magical thing, the sage called it a memory crystal, but Brett can be sure that this thing is just a similar appearance to the crystal, definitely not he Any mineral you know may not be a mineral at all! There seems to be boundless knowledge and strength. Every time I concentrate my thoughts on the surface of the crystal, I will enter a state of ecstasy. Then in this shackle, I can feel some unprecedented feelings and know a lot of new ones. Know how! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don't have this crystal, when will you be able to get the power of the present? The answer is not certain, but it is certain that it is absolutely impossible for you to increase your strength to this point in such a short period of time! It was a very hard thing to study magic under Raymond's door. Every day, I practiced hard and studied hard. The increase in magic was very slow, not like now. Since the Lord has given himself this memory crystal, he only needs to spend ten minutes a day, and he can clearly feel his ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright is thinking about it while walking out of this luxurious room. This is his mansion, he has been given the title of the count, and replaced the status of the court magician of the sorcerer, York is now his deputy - the nominal deputy, in fact he also knows that the sage passes this 傀儡Also monitor him and Victor two people! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cockroach was standing still at the door and didn’t know what he was doing, but Brett did not pay attention to him and went straight outside, oh Hey, I’m standing there in a daze! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be honest, before I got this memory crystal, I never knew that power could be obtained in such a simple and easy way. Sometimes I can’t believe it. At first, I was actually fighting for a battle between a magic book and the damn gold, the head of the family that was born in the student era. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he thought of the strong magician like a cow, Brett felt an anger, and he was annoyed every time he thought of the gold, though There are so many benefits in the hand of the Sayādaw, but the heart of Brett keeps telling himself that he has become a demon. Every time I think about this fact, Brett has an unusual anger. Brett now has enough confidence to beat the gold with magic in any one-on-one battle, if he can still meet with Kim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think of gold, think of the root of everything, think of the battle for the legendary magic book, between the two magicians The hand-to-hand combat is a memory of the shame that Brett can never forget. He was defeated by the kind of person who was born in a civilian school and could not afford the tuition at the School of Magic, and was knocked down by so many people in front of his audience with his fist. of! If there wasn't that thing at the beginning, I am afraid that I am still at the door of Raymond, and the mentor and the gang will study the magic book of the legendary strongest magician together! Speaking of it, there is still a point to look at this magic book, but forget it, there is nothing to behold about it, and it is convenient to study the magic book where you can use memory crystal! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two servants walked past the corridor in front, laughing and talking while walking, which allowed Brett to turn his mind to the woman, last night That woman is really good. If it wasn’t for me, I decided to change one every day. It’s good to let her spend more than a few nights... Thinking of it, Brett couldn’t help but turn around and look at the human figure, but Seeing that he was looking at himself, his eyes looked at himself without hesitation! Brett felt uncomfortable for a while, and turned and walked away from this awkward sight! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The legendary magic book? It’s so interesting! Let me see humans. Can write something that has something level!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some places, the sorcerer whispered, just now, his loyal use The information obtained by the heart is transmitted to him! After all, Brett is too short to get along with this embarrassment. I don’t know the power of this embarrassment... The Emperor Victor always used his spiritual power to build a defense line of mind to resist the invasion of mind reading. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The action of the magical statue stopped, and the power of its ability to act was disturbed No matter how hard the outside is, it is a sophisticated machine made with magic. As long as the internal interference is enough, it is enough to make it lose its ability to move! The more precise, the more so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good insurance! Ah... really hurts!" Seeing that Kim finally subdued the last guard of the treasure house, Lev took a breath, he While rubbing his shoulder, he said, but this does not prevent him from striding forward to the inner layer of the treasure house. Lev had noticed from the beginning that the inner door of this treasure house was not locked and could be opened easily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is really a treasure house! Rows of rows of shelves are placed there, with one treasure after another - no need to think about it, where ordinary things will be placed in such places, protected so tightly! As the magician looked around, Lev took his pocket from the waist - a large leather pocket that could hold a lot of things! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing?" Kim grabbed a gold crown that Lev was planning to throw into his pocket. Come here, although it came in with very disgraceful means, in order to get back what it should be, so the magician came in all the way, and never thought of himself as a thief (strictly speaking Called the thief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are here to get back our own things, not to steal things!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Don't die! It's easy to come in, you are going to go out with your hands? Do you know how much money I gave to the adventurer's union in order to get the information from this treasure house?" Lev slammed the crown, but the gold pinch was tight. Can't pull it. "We are adventurers, not thieves!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't forget the three thousand magic crystal coins we should get! We just take something to replace this It’s just a matter of money! The god of justice also judges what we have done without sin!” Lev spoke in the most arrogant tone, and his words could not be refuted! Kim let go of his hand and Lev took the gold crown into his pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold looks at Leif to quickly add something to his pocket, he I feel a little helpless at the side, I don't know what to do. As far as the personal character of Kim is concerned, he will never steal anything (normally), and he will never think of taking something that is not his own, but he also feels bad to stop Lev, because the latter is only Take away the replacement of the three thousand magic crystal coins. He stood there for a while and finally decided to find something that should belong to him, regardless of the actions of the thief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This warehouse is very big, no matter how big Leif’s pocket is, he can’t take one percent of the things arranged here, I want to find some specific ones. Things are very time consuming. The magician looked around, there were a lot of magic items, and they were all powerful magic items, but now Kim is not interested in seeing what he was interested in. The book, he is looking for the one he once had. After the magic book of the edge of the edge, once the magic of the above protection is broken, what is inside? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leif’s movements are fast, there is not much time, and the whole pocket is almost full! Although Lev especially found this pocket before coming here, but now he still regrets that the pocket is too small, so it is full. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician who is looking for it suddenly feels a strange look! The elf in the air suddenly had no reason to stir up, although the eyes could not see it, but the magician knew that there must be a force being transmitted here. The elves are affected by this power. In the frenzied flying, there is no need to distinguish anything. Kim knows that only the space magic can make the elf react so violently. There is something or someone who is coming here! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lev! Hurry up, someone is coming!" Kim grabbed his companion and ran towards the corner cabinet. The back of these cabinets was probably The only place to hide! Lev stretched out his hand and tried to grab his pocket, but Kim grabbed the inconvenient thing and handed his big pocket to the bottom of a shelf, dragging Lev to hide behind the cabinet. Two people hid behind the cupboard. Lev saw the serious look of the magician. He knew that he was not joking. He immediately pulled out the short sword with his left hand and two flying knives on his right hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who is it? At this time use the moment to move to this place? There are only two possibilities for using instant movement, either familiar with this place or setting up a summoning array. This should be the former - the one who is very familiar with this place must be the magician in the court! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden nervously looking through the cupboard, after a long time, people have not appeared... Is it not a person, just send something in magic? Impossible, if you want to send something, there is no need to pay so much effort, it is not good to open the door directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the speed of the show is really incredible, but this is space magic but there is nothing wrong! The reaction of the elves is getting more and more intense, and it is definitely not an illusion! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leif also looked nervously at the front, but he couldn’t see anything because he didn’t know the magic, and secondly he couldn’t feel the activity of the elf! Having said that, the thieves are not afraid to relax at all. The look of Kim is getting more and more tense, and it must be something that feels wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A black body like a phantom suddenly appeared, and then became an entity, Lev nervously looked at the huge body wrapped in this black robe, but Kim already recognized this The identity of the uninvited guest - in the half-orc wilderness, on the Dragon Island, they have seen several times! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter from which angle to analyze, Kim knows that he can't fight this demon! Although I have promised to go with him to deal with the Sayādaw after the Wei, but if there is a conflict now, the failure must be gold! Moreover, there is almost no chance of escape, and it will definitely be killed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Complete!" The magician had a cold sweat on his hand. The only hope was that the Lord would not find them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief did not notice the change of his companion, he just stared nervously at the every move of the sturdy guy wrapped in a black cloak. This guy's action reveals a strange feeling that makes Lev feel uncomfortable. However, from the appearance, this guy should not be a court magician, it may be the same purpose as them! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lord walked straight up a shelf and picked up a scorpion from the height of the shelf under the eyes of four eyes. He placed the scorpion on his hand, and the lid opened automatically, and the book inside floated out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Magic book..." Gold almost shouted out the voice, and the magic book that the sage is now in his hand is exactly what he is looking for. This legendary magic book, the most important legacy of the Holy Light Dynasty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sayādaw opened the magic book! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold stares at the reaction of the Supreme, but the demon seems to have not been affected by any of the defensive magic set on the book, and the reading is relished. In the same way, he turned the book a few pages in a row and then closed the magic book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't take it away, put the book down, then leave..." Kim's heart is crying desperately, but the desire is different from reality. The book was taken into the cloak, then turned around, facing the cabinet where two people were hiding! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The game of hide and seek is over, come out...hehehe" The frog's scream in the box rang. Two people came out from both sides of the cabinet. The magician tried his best to control his breathing and kept himself calm. Lev kept his alert posture. He placed the right hand holding the two flying knives behind the body, and the hand holding the short sword hanged down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? Is it you? It seems that we have a lot of fate...hehehe!" The shrill laughter of the singer rang again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know?" The thief was puzzled to see the gold, but he inferred from the nervousness of the magician that this is an enemy... and It is a terrible enemy... Could it be that the eight-eyed demon who claimed to be the sage of the elders of the dragon? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course...hehe, and it’s an old friend. There are not many people who can see me three times in a hostile identity with me...hehehehe..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The laughter was interrupted, and Lev took advantage of the opportunity of the sage to laugh, step forward and then wave his right hand, two cold light shot together The tall body of the sage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two flying knives hit the target, one shot into the shadow under the hood of the cloak, leaving only the shank exposed outside the chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh..." The laughter rang again, and the sage extended a hand full of cyan scales and pulled the two knives together - Lev saw that the blades of the two knives were not contaminated with any blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s not feasible to deal with me with this kind of toy!" The big hand forced it, and the pieces of steel fell from the crack in the hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to do?" The magician replied while looking for the magic that could deal with the demon from the deepest point of thought. But it seems that nothing can be done. As long as the sages are vindictive, all the magic will disappear immediately. If there is only one person, there may be a chance to escape, but now, no matter what, he can't leave the following husband to escape by himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mind of a hammered hammer hits the spirit of an unsuspecting thief, Lev makes a painful embarrassment, falls to the ground, and the body curls up . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing to do..." The same hammer hit, but the magician did not respond. Kim just felt a sudden shock and then returned to normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Really good..." I didn't think that this human spirit was so tough, and the tone of the Sayādaw was a bit surprising. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to say?" The magician replied, he had made a decision. The opponent was a demon. To defeat this enemy, he had to concentrate all his magic in one magic to have a chance to succeed. You must use a fast and powerful magic, and you must seize the opportunity to let the Supreme have no chance to use the vindictiveness... Although it is impossible to kill him, it is enough to get a chance to escape for yourself! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hehehe... I don't have the help of people now, and you are a very suitable candidate... If you are willing to help me, I can give you your own Unexpected rewards..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't need anything!" The magician tried hard to calm down his nervousness. The more he used the big magic, the more he used it. It is to keep the peace of mind, otherwise, once the magic is lost in the control of magic, the consequences are unimaginable! He bent down and helped Lev. The attack just made the thief suffer no small damage. When Jin Yi let go, he slammed back and went back until he put it on the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't want to get the ultimate knowledge and power of magic quickly? I can give you... For example, if you want to know why I can use space magic To this place that has never been here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With space magic Where did you go to places you haven't been to? How is this possible?" Kim was immediately attracted to interest. Isn't this thing actually, in fact, even theoretically impossible? But... Jin suddenly remembered that when the Sayādaw appeared, the time was long, and I never heard that the momentary movement was going to take so much time! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh...this is actually very simple! You should know that the world is made up of four layers, the lower level, our world, the top, the spirit, the top three The above is overlapping in a certain sense, the spiritual world is a kind of mapping relationship with the world...using the characteristics of overlapping worlds, that is, any point in the world is connected to the entire lower-level world, and the lower-level world Any point of the world is along with the whole world... As long as you can go to the lower world first, then use the connected characteristics to find the target you want to go to. Once you have determined the target, you can go directly to the target from the lower world..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But...this is impossible...the structure of the lower world is completely different from this world...the creatures of this world should not exist in that world..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh... do you humans have a profession called a summoner? Are they not the creatures that summon the lower worlds fighting? Since the creatures of the lower world can Exist in this world, then why can't the world's things exist in that world?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What exactly do you do?" The magician refused Living and asking, his thoughts have begun to immerse himself in this academic debate, almost forgetting who is in front of him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as you are willing to help me, I will naturally teach you the mystery of the whole process..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"呜..." The snoring from behind interrupted the devil's words. During the time of conversation between the two men, the thief had recovered from the previous mental attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lev!" Kim turned and looked at the thief leaning against the wall. At that moment, there was a gap in his closed mental protection, which allowed a will to invade. Although Kim immediately felt it, and immediately expelled the will, the Sayādaw already knew that he wanted to know. Things! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's your answer?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Similar to the mind-reading attack, but Kim still does not think that the Sayādaw has fully understood his inner thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where! Young people like you who are full of dreams, always believe in things like justice, it seems that nothing is useless. Let me teach you the real magic! "The things you get from the heart are not deceiving. The sages know the plan of Kim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...?" Kim looked at the sorrower and held out a hand, not knowing what the other party wanted to do! He had hoped to drag a little more time, waiting for Lev to fully recover, and then use the light bomb (a simplified version of the Thunder of God) to attack the ground where the Sayādaw is located, and then escape a distance and Behan round under the cover of smoke. Finally, escape with an instant move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But now, you can have the good fortune to look at the four hundred times of explosive balls... even with very common attacking magic, but after such a degree of compression, the power will become very strong...although your defensive magic is used Let it be good to let you understand the limits of power and then die..." With the words, the ball of light in the hand of the lord once again flourished and became a dazzling big light group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leif!" The magician rushed over and hugged the thief who was dizzy and ran out. Four hundred times the explosion of the ball! This is not something that ordinary magic can resist... The magician ran and tried to recite the magic spell of absolute magic protection, but even with this magic, he knew that he could not resist the explosion of four hundred times. If you don't think of a way right away, this time is really dead! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Run, see how far you can run... It’s not working to move magic with an instant, the building itself is protected by magic, huh... ...haha..." The side of the sage became translucent and then disappeared, leaving only an unusually expanding ball of light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behan started a little impatient outside! The defense of this place is so complete, there will be no other people coming in this middle of the night! Although it is necessary to leave a look at the outside, it is really boring to hide in this dark corner! I really want to know what is in this warehouse, it should be a treasure pile, otherwise, it will not set such a complete guard! However, the guys haven’t come out for so long... Didn’t they find the prize? I really don't know the workaround, just take some and bring it back...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sudden burst of light, Behan slammed his head and saw the big one. The warehouse was like a piece of paper, and it was broken into pieces by the power of the explosion. The sound that came out of it was not the whole palace, but even the whole city was clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A huge piece of construction flew over half a meter above the head of Behan, but this time Behan did not consider these flying The debris, after the blast of the explosion, he immediately ran to the warehouse - the place that should have been the warehouse - the two guys still did not come out inside... maybe the thief is finished, but the magician should still No death...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the explosion is really amazing, the roof of the entire warehouse with magical reinforcement and all four walls are completely flattened, even a corner There is nothing left, let alone the things or people inside. In front of Behan is a piece of white land, nothing, except for some fragments that don’t know what it was, nothing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gold, Lev!" Behan tried to shout the name of his companion, hoping that a voice would answer, but to be honest, after seeing this piece of white land He didn't actually have much hope! In this explosion, even the body can not be found! However, the magician may be able to survive with any protective magic - this is also the only hope of Behan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original fire and torches for lighting have disappeared. Now only a few light balls in the distance are still providing illumination, and the air is full of smoke and Dust, all this has become a hindrance to the line of sight, and it has become a hope for Behan to continue searching. Without these things, he can see that there is nothing in this place, or that there is nothing like human beings. Exist, I will give up the search immediately, and flee away before the guards arrive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leif! Kim!" Behan almost screamed with despair, three people went out, one came back, how would he go to the other two? Personally explain this thing? In the distance, the sound of running on the iron boots continued to pass. This huge explosion has alarmed the guards who are patrolling elsewhere, and they are coming here. Time is tight. If you can't find it again, you can only give up. Besides, in this explosion of power, the chances of surviving are really too few. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just two meters from Behan, one hand stretched out from the ground. Then, a body was drilled out of the soil. The magician's body is covered with a thick layer of soil, almost integrated with the surrounding environment, no wonder Behan can not find. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gold!" Behan’s surprise ran over. The magician was covered in dirt, but it looked good. "You have nothing!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can't die..." Kim wants to show a smile, although his face is now full of gray and earth! But there was a voice under his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What kind of organization did you touch? I have already told you that before you take things, you must first use magic to detect if there is a trap..." Behan helped the two companions and said that he did not Know what's going on inside the warehouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have such a trap mechanism?" Jin smiled and replied, the thing just happened is a fluke, if the Sayādaw immediately issued a four hundred times overlapping explosions, and If you don't delay and release it first, unless his strength is ten times bigger than now, otherwise, there is no bones! It was this time that gave them a chance to get into the hole that had just come in. "We have run into the guy who shouldn't have come across... It's a blessing to survive!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is it?" Behan thieves Pulled up from the ground and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You! What are you doing here?" A voice passed over and interrupted a group of people, and the court guard arrived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A ball of light appeared on the heads of the three thieves, and there were magicians among the guards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The man is...one of those adventurers!" A soldier shouted out. Of the three, only the swordsman was still clean. Net, the other two people have been completely covered by ash and earth. Although the gang of adventurers injured the Foreign Minister, although it was not announced, but inside the guards, no one knows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hurry and leave!" The magician quickly put his hand on his chest. Although the rest of his magic is actually unable to support the consumption of instantaneous movements, it is now necessary to move away with an instant movement. If arrested, whether or not they can prove that the person who destroyed the warehouse is not theirs, the three of them - five of them - are absolutely incapable of dying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a departure from the encirclement of the guards that appear everywhere In a certain undetectable space, a pair of eyes are watching everything happen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hehehe... I’m happy to be alive!...one like you, the character you can use...so short time It can grow so much inside, and if it takes a little more time, it should be more suitable... plus a little pressure to speed up your growth... a little stronger, then I can make a third one... I really didn’t think of it. Actually, there is such a way... Is this really a human-written thing?..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Kim and his several companions’ bodies disappeared, These eyes also disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three people appear in the room of Kim! Before going out, the magician set up a summoning battle here. The original plan was to use magic to transport the stolen goods back together, but now it has become a tool for escape. The three people can almost be said to be empty-handed, except for bringing back a crime that is absolutely a decapitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold immediately collapsed. The space magic just was an extraordinary success. It was just like having the power to help yourself behind the scenes - But even so, his physical strength and mental strength have reached the limit, and after determining his magic success, he can't stand even. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do we do?" Lev put the magician who had already been a gray ball on chuang and set the mind and raised the question. The night thief was proposed by him. Now that he has something wrong, he must bear the main responsibility. Although this failure should be said that he can only complain that his luck is not good, it is not the fault of anyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What can I do? Of course, I will run away quickly!" Behan is really regretting now, if he starts with black cloth, he will give his face If you are covered, there will be no such problem now. However, it was too confident at the time. It is too late to say anything. It is a dead end to stay in the city of Delante. If you don’t run fast, last year’s competition in the ring will be on the gallows or the guillotine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Call everyone up, we must discuss what to do!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... ...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meeting of the adventurers is simple and fast, everything is irreparable, and it’s useless to blame, Erna and Wei and Wei both know this, and everyone has no complaints. The place to go is also very clear. I have gotten such a big thing and got rid of the treasury of Delant (although it is actually done by the Sacred, but it is Behan), very soon. The wanted order will be spread throughout the territory of Delante, and only to the death of Delante, the territory of the Reiter Empire can guarantee the safety of a group of people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost at the end of the adventurer’s meeting, a close-up waited for Nikola’s sleep, which was hard to fall asleep. "His Majesty... Your Majesty... Your Majesty..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What!" The emperor turned up and sat up, lying in his personal secret room, outside. He couldn't hear the sound, even the loud explosion. He was in a bad mood today. Even if his daughter’s problem was finally reluctantly accepted, it was not a happy thing, so he slept alone in the secret room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope you give me a suitable reason to call me in the middle of the night, otherwise...you know it yourself!" Nikolay stared at the front The attendant said one word at a time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The big thing happened, the treasure house was completely destroyed, and the guards of the guards all lost their jobs!" The attendant was not afraid at all, whispered. After all, he stayed with the emperor for a long time, knowing his temper - although the emperor's temper is very violent, but he can always use reason to beat the impulse at the last moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The treasure house was destroyed... is it stolen?" Nikolay has not understood it, and this situation is really unexpected this evening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It was destroyed!" The attendant described the situation in the most correct way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Destroy...do you mean?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, your treasure has been No, the things inside were destroyed along with the warehouse itself, nothing left!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" The emperor was as punctured by the needle I jumped up. "Someone ruined my treasure house? Who is it? Who is so bold! Have you found any clues?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The guards said... It seems to be the adventurer who injured the foreign minister last time!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems?...I want the exact news! Who is it? Actually Going deep into the palace in the middle of the night can cause such a great destruction! Call my captain of the Guard... The safety of the palace is his responsibility!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is already Waiting at the door!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was asked to come in immediately, he must give me a reasonable explanation, how did those people get into me in the night? Palace!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The group of adventurers... I think they must It’s hateful, touched in the middle of the night, and after destroying everything that can be taken away, it will completely destroy the warehouse with magic...” The existing data is analyzed and inferred, the captain of the guard is in the emperor’s This report was made in front of me. "In addition to losing all the items inside the warehouse, there are four guards who have lost their jobs!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How did they come in? The patrols you arranged did not have any Found? How is it going to happen?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, they must know where the patrols are arranged throughout the palace... so they can find the patrol gap And they have magicians who can break the magical traps of magic..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Enough! You mean, there are only magicians, any People can enter and leave my palace casually, and then just destroy some things and escape! Today is a warehouse, tomorrow? Later? Is it my turn to my secret room, my palace..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty..." The Guardian’s chief wanted to explain, but he couldn’t speak because his responsibility was inevitable from any angle. He is a standard plain soldier. It is the Bank's march. It is not very suitable for the court protection work, let alone take office for less than half a year (the original guy has already gone up). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the anger erupted, part of the reason returned to the mind, and Nikolay calmed down. Those adventurers are really not a good deal to deal with, otherwise it is impossible to win the competition at the contest, and it is even more impossible to come back to the undead island. After being deprived of the bonus, he should take measures to prevent this from happening... but this is too much, and it is a complete destruction... Nikola is more and more eager, this kind of thing is absolutely Can not easily let go, must let those who are lawless know a lot! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
