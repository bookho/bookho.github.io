			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Must leave aside, don't have a command heart!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician did his best, but the elf simply ignored him. Like the countless attempts he has made before, without using prayers and spells, he has no way to use magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can't do it!" Gold's distressed answer. He simply did not use any will, but the elf just ignored him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You must abandon the idea of ​​ordering them!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't! I have followed you Said it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have!" Liz stood in front of Kim, and then Kim saw the wind elves gather around her quickly. Their power created a compressed air mass, and then the compressed air bomb hit the gold body unrelentingly, almost let him fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can't take any command of the will, because you have no right to order them, it just makes them more annoying and away from you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I really don't!" Kim replied with the painful chest of the next hit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s just that you don’t feel it! You never thought of these elves as equal friends with you!” Reese retorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But what do I do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Liss didn’t answer, she raised her hand A small fire appeared in her palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, you don't know that the elves you see are already relatively powerful elves. There are more, smaller elves, they even have their own There is no will, mixed together, can not be separated from each other, but these are the smallest things that make up the world, constitute the shape of each object... Do you understand? Kim! They are truly great, you have to understand yourself It’s small, you don’t have to be strong, you can have them with them...” Lisi said softly, her tone of voice is like a mother’s gentle teaching to her children. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As long as you request them, don't be arrogant and arrogant, they will help you right away, help you like a friend! But now your heart is too Pride, because you are bleeding from human blood..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lisi turned her face and spit her tongue at the stupid gold. "Actually, I I don't understand, this is what my mother taught me, haha! Forget it, take a break, look at you, sweating all over."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The magician sat down and reminisced about what Lisi had just said. He turned his head to see the semi-fairy, and saw that the other person was holding his chin and looking into the distance. The two of them are in the remote corner of the camp, and from here they are the endless grasslands. Liz’s eyes were staring at the few white clouds on the horizon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong?" Kim couldn't help but ask, it's not very polite to think of such a question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I remembered that my mother is coming!" Lisi whispered, and then she smiled again, although she smiled a little. "I was thinking, if my mother knows what I am like now, I don't know what she thinks! Oh!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your mother? That is not..." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My mother is of course a high class fairy, is there any problem?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No... ...nothing..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lisi turned her head and continued to look into the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My dad used to be the bodyguard of the caravan, followed the caravan to the big forest and do business with the halflings - it was a very risky but high income The work. Later he separated from other people in the forest, lost his way, and met my mother!" Liss said to herself in a very calm tone. "Then two of them fell in love, combined, and then there is me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It’s hard to believe it! But this is a fact. Few high-level goblins can resist the temptation of human beings, and few humans can resist the temptation of high-level goblins. Human enthusiasm, heroic, exuberant and vitality, and high The goblin is noble, elegant, beautiful, ... or both races see each other from the part they lack. Isn’t it a matter of course to combine with each other? Just... when the spark of love fades, look at each other On the other side, human beings are rude, greedy, full of **, and high-level goblins are stubborn, rigid, and obsessive of dogma. In the end, they can only use breakup as a result." Seems to understand the question of Kim, Lisi continued, Her voice went down and seemed to remember her unhappy childhood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician is silent, because he does not know what to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, Beckham's brother has more talent for elf magic than you. Because he can always look at everything with the same vision, you know when I am. Fall in love with him? Probably the first time I met, he was the first of all the people I have ever seen to look at me without a different kind of eyes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Forget it! Don't say it," Liz ended the conversation before Kim had spoken. "Continue to practice, we only have two days at most. I can only teach you what I know, and the rest will not matter!" The dark clouds on her face have completely disappeared at the moment. "In fact, I know." A little. Really come in handy, I will only summon the fog and the gas bombs just now, oh!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician continues to start his futile The attempt, but as Liss said, the inner consciousness is not a sentence or a period of practice can be changed, the magician is just vain, nothing can be done. His consciousness can't drive the elves, and once the heart produces an anxious emotion—which is hard to avoid—it's even more impossible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have been betrayed!" Gary pointed out in front of all his subordinates This cruel reality. Behan stood opposite him, watching the head of the white hair extending a part of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cruel reality is in front of them. The chief commander of the frontline of the Leite Empire, Xia Lian, has obtained a comprehensive victory in politics. In the midst of his disintegration and coercion, the last group of the Red Alliance against the Empire has also collapsed, and the temper of the merchants is fully revealed here, turning his face faster than flipping cards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All formed mercenary groups have received notice of the cancellation of the contract, except for them. Now a little well-informed person knows the great prince of the Reiter empire, the future heir to the throne. Max has been killed and died, and the "Black Dragon Mercenary Corps" that caused him to die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor is definitely not forgiving the killing of the Son, and even if it is not, he is the old opponent (Gary once sawing in the city of Berwick In the war, he suffered a lot of pains. He also hated it. For this reason, the merchants sold out Gary to win the favor of the Leite Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gary took the request from the employer and asked him to lead the troops to defend the northeast. And his personal intelligence network clearly pointed out that the Reiter empire secretly concentrated a large army in that area. By the number of people in his hand, it is simply to send the sheep into the wolf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have two choices!" Gary looked around for people around. "Either our Black Dragon mercenary group is now dissolved, or we are going northwest." Go forward and find a way to enter the place where the power of the Leite Empire has not yet been reached."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody speaks, everyone knows what it means to dissolve. So that most people can leave safely, as long as they hide this history, they can live the same life as others, but Gary himself or his daughter is going to be in the pursuit of the overnight and bounty hunters of the Leite Empire. I spent the rest of my life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behan’s voice interrupted the final attempt of the wizard. Lisi’s reason is very clear, but Kim can’t do it, can’t do it, and there is no sign of success at all. This may be the difference between the two races. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gold! Lisi! You two are here! I am looking for it! Liz, the head is calling you." Behan pretends a The deputy relaxed look, but the moment that Kim and his eyes met, he knew that there was a new worry in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This should have been a breakup with Behan in the past few days, but no one seems to be willing to mention it first. Everyone will stay in the mercenary first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's see, a great news!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Behan and Lisi leaving, Kim would have some doubts about opening the paper, which is a lot of gold. The "Mainland Newsletter" of the second time begins with the most conspicuous words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Deco army won the first battle and easily defeated the resistance of the half-orcs!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Below this headline is the latest size message. Article 15 is the good news that Behan said: "Derrand canceled the wanted for five thieves."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The magician put down the list, but there is no joy in his heart. Although this is a good news, the failure to try Elf Magic has made him feel depressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Try again!" Kim said to himself. When I was at the Magic Academy, it took a week for him to make a contract with the first god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Behan walked out of the tent to find Lisi, everything was fixed. It is. His opinion was almost passed by everyone. In any case, they have always lived a life of blood and blood, not afraid of danger. And the situation in front of us is not so bad, at least it is much better than covering the army when it was lost in the city of Berwick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if they are dissolved on the spot, the situation will never change better. Anyone can make a sum of money to get the commission from the adventurer’s union. The list of the main personnel of the Corps, when they really become a prey with no resistance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chances are still great now, and if they haven’t completely smashed their skin, they may be able to retreat to a safe place, and even if they are defeated, then There is no difference in disbanding and fleeing anyway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Black Dragon Mercenary Corps is now very large, with a population of nearly 10,000, but this is mainly due to the recent massive absorption of scattered mercenaries. If they really violate the agreement with the employer, they do not have the economic power to maintain such a large army. However, Gary does not intend to cut personnel, because his movement to the northwest must encounter the interception of the enemy, and it must be a suitable choice to maintain sufficient strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything was decided at this meeting. Just tomorrow, that is, the time that the merchants arranged, they will pretend to advance to the arranged trap, and then change direction in the middle, break through the weak part of the Leite army, and use the speed of the marching force to escape unexpectedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four people temporarily communicated and finally decided to act with the army for the time being. There are two reasons for this. One is because the mercenaries are moving in the same direction as their goal, the temple of the goddess of life, and on the other hand, they are wanted, even though the Delante has been lifted. The order is wanted, but that doesn't mean they can be completely safe in the red league where the bounty hunter is everywhere - a separate advance is likely to provoke some unnecessary trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, there are still some reasons why everyone has not said it. Two years of adventure, many times of life and death, have long cultivated deep feelings, and it is a bit reluctant to break up with Behan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the marching route we are going to cross the garden of the goddess and leave there." Lev made this conclusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All ready to fight, array!" Spread in the middle. The mercenaries in the march stabilized the turm with the fastest speed and began an orderly arrangement. In fact, they are not afraid of anything. The halflings in the sky have brought the enemy's news, and the enemy's strength is less than half of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the tenth day of the march. Six days ago, the slashing tactic was successful. The Leiter army was so stupid to wait for them to go online. I didn't expect them to go far away. But when they understood it, Xia Lian immediately began to dispatch troops, but it was too late, and now the right one is only the last army that can be intercepted by the enemy who is less than half of his strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behan horse riding is on the front line, he is responsible for commanding the left wing. This battle does not seem to be difficult. The gap between the strengths of the two sides is so obvious, and all of them are veterans of war. Moreover, the enemy is mainly infantry, there are few cavalry, and there seems to be no support from the magician. From the strength analysis, they are winning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is that?" It was strange that the first line of the Leiter army actually placed some strange guys. It was a group of soldiers who did not wear armor - even the tops were not worn. They are very scattered, and their faces and bodies are painted with weird paint. The purpose of the people is their tall and strong body and the weapons in their hands. The giant swords of the whole color can make people and horses together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are these guys doing? Attack? In that way, a bow and arrow can kill them. If there are too few defenses, the total number is less than one hundred, and the loose ones are listed in front of the battlefield. Behan felt that it was not right, but it was even worse. The guys started singing as if no one was there. A strange song, it should be the first battle song, although I can not understand but can also understand the tragic in the melody. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers also began to feel a little uneasy, and no one could understand what the Thunder army was doing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...the ancestors accompanied us to fight...the sword broke, With a fist... The hand is broken, and the teeth are used..." Wei gently sang with the song from the opposite side. This familiar battle song has not been heard for a long time, and it seems that it seems to last a lifetime. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a Berserker!" Wei, who was placed behind the infantry queue, suddenly understood what they were facing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a commotion in the queue of mercenaries, and one person squeezed out a dense battle. Wei looked forward and immediately understood that the most worrying fact had already happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Behan! Quick retreat!" he shouted, pushing hard at the soldiers who were overwhelmed and blocked. "It’s a mad warrior!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it was too late, just before they reacted, the Berserkers ended the battle song and took their The giant sword rushed over here, and the speed was so astounding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mercenary’s queue shot a wave of arrows that went straight to those who were unprotected. But this is not used, even if the body is full of arrows, they still do not feel, continue to pounce here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, the devils who have been in a frenzy have rushed to the front, and they have wheeled the terrible weapon, whether it be human, horse or shield weapon. This terrible fanaticism collapsed in front of him. The Berserkers rushed into the enemy line, slashing and slashing, all of them angered at present, and they were invincible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mercenaries fought back, but these enemies were not afraid of injury at all, and even if they hit the key, they were useless. The panic began to spread. No one knows how to deal with these terrible enemies who are not afraid of death. These are people, they are monsters. Nothing can stop them. The entire front was in chaos, and the enemies played terrible crushing power, and the bodies piled up on the battlefield like mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mercenary was completely chaotic, completely devoid of resistance, and nearly collapsed. The enemy's main force took the opportunity to launch an offensive, which made the retreat of a slightly orderly beginning into a complete defeat. The battle has turned into a one-sided slaughter. Fortunately, even the enemy itself is quite afraid of these enchanted warriors, not too close. But what is the use of this? The mad warrior who burns his life for strength is not exhausted, and as fast as the wind, he easily catches up with all the laggards and kills them one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Continental Calendar, 999 years, the Red Alliance and the Reiter Empire launched at the northern border A big battle was defeated. Ten thousand mercenaries were almost completely smashed, and Gary, the commander who fought for many years with the Empire, also died in this battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Alna...Alna...had heard my call?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Who is this? Who is calling me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Help me... Elna... I need your help... I need yours Power... Give me strength..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound is empty and distant, but familiar and gentle, where should I hear it, but only for a while can not recall. Accompanied by this help, the power is conveyed from an unspeakable passage, just like the flood that opened the gate, but Elna did not resist, letting the power drain from the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun once again rose from the eastern peaks, telling another day to come. A gust of wind blew through the forest, and the alarmed crows sent out an unlucky scream, rising from the forest like a black cloud, flying in the direction of the sun's projection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leif quickly passed through the woods and saw the crow flying like this, and suddenly there was a bad hunch in his heart, which made him further step up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the third day of flight. To be honest, Lev is still scared until now. When the entire army was defeated, the scene was simply unspeakable, like an avalanche. The panicked soldiers rushed to escape, and you pushed me to squash and kill each other in chaos. In order to survive, only use weapons to kill all those who block the road, whether it is an enemy or a friend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they finally escaped from the narrow zone, the situation became even worse. Fear has penetrated into the deepest part of everyone's bones. Everyone is escaping and fleeing. When the sword behind it is cut, almost no one will turn back to resist. There are horses running wildly, no horses throwing away weapons and armor to run faster. It is simply a group of lambs that are unresisting in front of the wolves. Just as the saying goes, "The defeat is like a mountain," and that situation is out of the reach of anyone. The thief can escape a life is simply a blessing by the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I don’t know what’s going on outside, Leif can be sure that the Leiter army is searching for cadres from the fleeing mercenaries. Temporarily hiding in the mountains is the right choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behan, Kim, Wei, all three have been gone - in the chaos this is inevitable, in fact, can meet Elna is a big fortune - I don't know how they are, I have experienced so many adventures, this time I should be tempted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leif saved this kind of respectable self-comfort through the woods and back to the little cave where they were temporarily hiding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alna still lying there motionless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief put down the freshly picked fruit in his hand, approached the therapist's body, reached out and touched her forehead, but the unusual high temperature was heard in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s strange, why are the therapists who are sheltered by the goddess infected with the disease? Although very doubtful, the facts are facts, and Erna continued to have a high fever for two days, and her mind was unclear. In the past two days, Lev has been taking care of her, but until now, Elna has not shown signs of recovery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leif sighed. If he is alone, then he has the confidence to escape anyone's search - this is his specialty - leaving the mountain, but if you bring Elna, who is not known, this is impossible. The task is gone. At this moment, Lev really regrets why he didn't learn some medicines from the old Locke. He has nothing to cure except for some bleeding bandages and powder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wet handkerchief originally covered on Elna’s forehead has fallen to her side, and the thief picked it up and found that the handkerchief was completely dry. He dipped his handkerchief into a small otter formed by the water oozing from the stone, and then gently placed it on the forehead of Erna's high fever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leif?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaves who had just turned around were mad at this sentence Shocked, he turned his head and found the open eyes of the therapist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Would you wake up? Elna!" Lev asked with some surprises, although there was no past in the eyes of Elna, but at least she Has recovered consciousness. "How are you feeling?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'm fine!" Elna replied gently, then slowly reached for the wet cloth on her forehead. She turned her head and smiled at Lev. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this thank you, but Lev is a bit overwhelmed, or Saying that this gaze to him made him feel helpless, he looked at Elna because of a fever and some blushing and thus a more delicate face, there is a feeling that the eyes do not know where to look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you, it should be!" Lev opened his eyes and looked at the empty rock wall on the side. The face was uploaded with a strange feeling. Although I didn't know what was so embarrassing, Leif had no way to control himself. He couldn't even turn his head. He was afraid that Erna would find his strangeness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leif quickly ran to the nearest river, or ran so fast just to vent his inexplicable impulse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The creek is not too far, and it’s time to turn over a hill. But Lev did not find that his water tank was actually full until he ran to the river to get water. This discovery made Lev consciously stunned, he had to dump the water in the bag and install it again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sudden rush of bird songs came, and then a group of birds of various colors bloomed into the air like the ripples of the stone thrown into the water. The thieves immediately realized that it was unusual. This phenomenon means that some uninvited guests visited the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lev took up the water bag and checked his short sword and knife that he never left, especially the one who carried him - or they - all The property's close-packed bag, then skillfully sneaked away from the position where the birds took off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest are here. At the time of departure, the military capacity of the 10,000 people was now only the remains of nearly 400 people. The failure was too terrible and complete, and so many people died. The body was stretched for dozens of kilometers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the plans that were scheduled in advance were made on paper. The worst result expected at the time was defeat and then disbanded on the spot. But who would have thought that it would lose like this? The mercenaries were all well-equipped, and even if the situation was not good, the escape should not be a problem, but after the terrible Berserkers, all the preconditions were reversed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a complete slaughter, and it’s still the result of Liss’s flaming. Dealing with the Berserkers, only to completely dispel their **. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold powerlessly sitting next to a large stone, he felt very tired. He is one of the few people who have no hanging color. Although the magicians are very vulnerable on the battlefield, they are the ones with the highest chance of escape when the battle is fixed. When the defeated soldiers rushed over like the tide, the magicians who were placed behind the army immediately fled with flying magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire camp is filled with the sorrows and fears of the defeated army, which is inevitably infected with gold, and he never imagined that this would happen. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behan was slightly injured, and Wei was retired, but Lev and Elna were gone. No one knows that they are dead or just lost. Fortunately, Lisi finally gathered up this small defeated soldier in time, otherwise they were all over. After a game of almost desperate cat catching mice, they actually escaped from the enemies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leite Army has a killing order, no captives, as long as the head! It seems that the Emperor Victor has hated this mercenary group that took his son's life, and it is not a rumor. Reiter soldiers searched and ran away from the mercenaries, and caught one to kill one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Starting!" A sound rang, although they stopped for less than an hour. But the fear of death threatened them, and everyone climbed up with a weary body, holding their equally exhausted horses and embarking on the road. They must flee far away, and the army of Reiter did not realize that the small force fled as far as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl is in front of the team, she is now almost everyone's spiritual sustenance. Without the self-confidence that she showed, without the unwavering tone and confidence, they simply could not keep going. Everyone has reached the limit, whether it is ** or spirit, such a small force may collapse at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where to go?" The team did not know who suddenly raised the issue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Northward!" Lisi replied in a crisp and neat manner. She never seemed to know tiredness and did not shake anything. "Through the enemy blocking the road! Then we are safe!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun has gone down the hill. By the time they were dark, they had crossed the woods and chose a direction that almost no one thought of leaving the area controlled by the Rite Army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is already deep, and Behan is lying in a tent that is free to sit up, no sleep. Although he was very tired, he could not fall asleep when the wound on his leg was tortured. He has experienced this feeling for a long time since he got to know the therapist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was silence in the military camp, everyone was asleep because of fatigue, and even the sentinel was no exception. He "Who?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A subtle footstep came, and Behan instinctively grabbed the sword of the earth and whispered. His position is on the edge of this camp, and if there is an enemy raid, it is likely to choose this position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am... can I come in?" The voice of the semi-fairy girl came from the tent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was the first time I felt powerless. I flew in the sky, looking for a suitable reason for my embarrassment, and then discovered that it was all in vain. The panic of people is pouring out and cannot be stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time I really understood my pride. Destiny made me a disciple of a great magician, so I got more and more results with less time than others. I thought that I was different from others. I thought that I was always humble and gentle. Now I realized that pride has actually gotten into every bone. Especially when I understand that I am a cursed mage, with the unique talent of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My first thought was to use the curse, use the slash, and destroy all enemies, along with all the mercenaries. I found that I couldn't afford to fail. Once I failed, I was so angry that I wouldn't hesitate to destroy everything. Even if I used Nubis to swear to me for countless times, I couldn't care. Just like I was defeated by the semi-fairy, I couldn’t admit defeat, but I found a lot of reasons for myself. If I don't see Behan's wounds because of my mistake, I think I will hate her, and then I will try my best to retaliate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All those who have guided me have told me not to care too much about failure, failure is inevitable for a young person, and it is very helpful. Learning from the failures and learning from experience will make me stronger. But I found that I can't learn anything from failure now. I only get anger, not willing, and looking for reasons for all kinds of arguments. Don't think about anything at all, just keep moving forward blindly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves refused to accept me as normal, because I am really proud. Except for a few companions who are close to myself, I never think about the feelings of others. It is not those magicians who are among the mercenaries who reject me. I am deliberately rejecting them! Because I think they are not worthy of being my companions! So in that ambush, I helped the Ritter soldiers. I regard myself as a god and think that I am qualified to decide others and put myself in a transcendent position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Lisi asked me why I wanted to gain strength, I answered her "I want to guard the people I want to guard", and now it looks ridiculous. I actually want to guard? What qualification do I have to think that others need my guardian? Protect my loved ones? Do they live a stable and stable life and need my guardianship? Guardian partners? Which of them does not protect their own strength, is it for me to guard? So when I say that, who am the person I am referring to? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am actually afraid of the answer and are not willing to think about it...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm!" Behan sighed and put the sword of the earth down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lisi opened the tent door and walked in. She was dressed neatly, but she did not wear the usual helmet. There is no hair accessory on the head of the semi-fairy, and the smooth, golden hair is directly spread over the shoulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Beihan brother, are you okay?" The girl walked closer and then sat next to Behan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing, rest assured!" Behan answered this, but this is also to talk about it. The wound that was not treated in time is now inflamed, red and swollen, and the thigh looks thick. This day's itinerary is a cruel torture, and each step brings a new pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So late, is there anything?" Behan re-sit down and straighten his legs in a most comfortable position to reduce the wound The pain, he decided to open the subject, the girl has already suffered too much pressure, and he is not willing to add another one to the slender shoulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lis did not answer, she seemed to be silent. When Behan found out that he was not right and got back up again, he saw Liss' eyes filled with tears and hangs down her slightly cheeks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dad... Dad... Dad, he is dead..." The girl couldn’t control it anymore. She slammed into Behan’s arms and whispered. For a few days, I forced myself to suppress myself, pretending to be myself with a strong mask, hiding fear and sorrow, and the girl has reached the limit. At this moment, she finally showed the true side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't do anything..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not your fault...you already It’s done very well...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behan gently stroked Liss’s supple hair and calmed her emotions. Almost everyone saw how Gary was when he died. When Gary's deadly arrow fell on the battlefield, the huge eagle flew down from the sky, grabbing Gary's body and vacating. This move also revealed to the emperor why they always have the insight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl suddenly looked up and looked at Behan’s face, her face full of tears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you do next? I don't know anything....I don't know where to go... I don't know anything... although I pretend Everything knows, but it's all fake..." She began to weep again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behan held the girl’s tearful face with her hand. Suddenly, he understood that at this moment she was no longer threatening him and her with crying in his eyes. The little girl who played the wedding game together, although unconscious, but now he really sees her as a woman...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Swordsman gently Kissing the tears on the girl's face, then his lips fell on the red lips that seemed to be shaking. His powerful arm tightly gripped the body of the semi-fairy, as tight as a squat, just like to fold her into two paragraphs...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, Lev arrived at his destination. He pulled out two small knives in his hand and slowly searched forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There seems to be nothing nearby, neither listening to human voices nor seeing people moving. Lev carefully searched the entire possible area, but found nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe it is an illusion! The thief explained this phenomenon to himself. It is likely that the shadow of the cloud projected into the woods and alerted the birds. During the day, these highly alert wild birds are always easily frightened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief stood out from the hidden position and smoothly inserted the two knives back onto the belt. Since there are no accidents, then I should go back. Elna is still waiting for me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief leaves the small grove that is easy to hide and walks back in the direction of the hollow of the woods. It was like this. The Leite army wouldn’t have to rummage through every piece of land nearby. It’s too much doubt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief of the trot suddenly stopped and seemed to find something. He immediately re-extracted the weapon, holding the dagger in one hand and two small knives in the other. Carefully looking around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a small piece of mud in front of him, the traces of a human soldier’s iron boots are clearly printed...<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thieves began to rush back, the most worrying thing happened, judging from the footprints left by the guys, the soldiers marched in the direction of their temporary residence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s very dangerous to run on the road because it’s easy to be discovered by others. But Lev didn't care so much because he knew that the cave he chose was not hidden. If the enemy's direction remains the same, Erna's white robe is definitely a very obvious goal, except for the blind man who will notice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s getting closer, but the traces left by those people indicate that their direction has not changed. This forest began to get dense, and it was too dangerous to run this fast. Lev's cat fell down and slowly slowed down, moving as fast and silent as possible to the cave where Elna was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A scream in the distance came from the wind, it was the voice of Erna. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feeling of the body slowly improved, the original kind of exotic Fatigue also began to fade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Erna knows her strength, even if she treats a thousand wounded at the same time, or uses a reincarnation, it is absolutely impossible to reach this limit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some vague memories in the brain that I want to grasp but I can’t grasp it. There seems to be a voice for help, but who is there? There can be no other people besides Lev...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a footstep interrupted her thoughts, it should be that Lev came back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look! Someone!" A strange voice came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alna turned his head in surprise and saw three strangers standing not far away. They all wore the chest of the Reiter empire and carried weapons on them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is a therapist...or a woman?" The one who took the lead took a step forward. "Brothers, this time, there is no white... I lost my way to find such a good prey... It’s still a big beauty...hahahaha”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smell in the voice makes Elna feel chilling, She wanted to stand up, but when she pressed her hand to the ground and tried to prop up her body, she found that her body became so heavy that she could not struggle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With another burst of laughter, a figure rushed up and pressed against her, holding Alna's body tightly with both hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah..." Elna struggled with all her strength, but her body was too weak and could not be moved by the man's face down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hand began to pull her robes. Erna suddenly remembered what would happen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lev chose an observation point from the dense foliage. From here it seems that everything is clear, Elna is lying on the ground, the three men - now sure to be the soldiers of the Leite - stand by, specifically, one standing, the other two As if to say something, or to evaluate Elna's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leif felt that his eyes were coming out of the fire, but he still pressed the urge to rush up immediately, using the soldiers who did not pay attention The opportunity to go around to the side. He has a total of five knives in his hands. As long as he is close to five meters before the enemy finds out, he has the confidence to kill the three guys. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is this? I have never seen it...not a scar..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "When did you see this kind of scar? Try it with a knife!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a strange conversation over there, proving that those guys were completely unprepared The murderous enemy is approaching. Lev did not listen to this conversation at all, as long as he knew that those guys were not prepared for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief jumped up and slammed his left hand before the enemy had any action. The two flying knives all hit the outermost unlucky one, and one stabbed the heart and stabbed the neck. The guy didn't slam and fell down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other two turned around and found the change, but did not wait for them to react, Lev threw the three flying knives in his right hand, standing The guy who was holding the belly and throat was slammed, but the man who was kneeling with his right hand blocked the knife facing him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lev stretched out the remaining knife, but the man who had a knife in his hand had already reacted. He rushed like a beast, just in Lev. When I waved my hand, I ran into the body of the thief. The huge, thick body knocked the thief out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two men twisted into the ground. The smaller Lev obviously suffered a lot, and the whole person was pressed below. Although the other side had a knife on his arm, his strength was much stronger than that of Lev. Lev’s only advantage was the knife in his hand. He tried his best to attack the man with a knife, but the other hand grabbed his wrist with his left hand and hit his chest and head with his right elbow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two sides were deadlocked there, and the thieves tried to entangle the other's waist and legs with their own legs, so that the guy could not pick it up and could not occupy a more favorable position. The battle became a stamina. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Great strength!" Lev gasped. It was really a mistake to kill the other person at once, but it is useless to say anything now. The hand was like a steel tongs, and his right hand could not move. But in the same way, he has no chance to solve this enemy that is under his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now two people face to face, each other sees each other very clearly, both sides can even feel the other's breathing. This Reiter soldier should be about the same age as him, but now his face is full of cruel and vicious wrinkles, and the entire face is distorted by pain and force. But Lev believes that his face is definitely not good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lev’s chest and face are blood. The wounds that his flying knife had caused to his opponent were very deep. The blood was just like the spring water, and the whole cuff was dyed red, and Lev’s chest and shoulders were also dyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face is getting closer and closer, in order to increase the pressure, the person presses down the body, but this action gives the thief a chance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leif stopped the hopeless struggle of his right hand, using all his strength and slamming into the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sudden blow caused the expected result, accompanied by a wailing, the enemy's hand strength was obviously loose. He took the opportunity to pull out the right hand holding the knife! The outcome has already been decided. The enemy now has a lot of gaps. Before his hands can protect himself, the soft throat is exposed to the thief without any precautions...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening the body that has no life, Lev stood up. At this moment, he felt the power of overdraft to leave the body and let fatigue replace it. The battle was just too dangerous. After the victory, he still felt a while. The thief's face turned to the cave, and Elna was still lying in the shadow of the rock wall. Lev could clearly see the ripped clothes scattered around her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Alna!" Lev screamed, he hesitated a little, then walked over there. It can be seen now that Elna is almost half naked and there is a blood red on her back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Alna!" Lev ran away without thinking about it, while moving his hand to the waist, trying to solve the small bag containing all kinds of powder. package. Those bastards must have hurt Elna just now! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leif came to Alna and also took out the hemostatic powder bottle, but this time he found himself wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alna has a red glow on her back, not the blood of her or someone else, but something that Lev has never seen before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a bright red, but amber-like translucent object, silky, covered with Erna’s entire back, tight Inlaid in the smooth skin of Baizhe. These things are very bloody, but when you touch them with your fingers, they feel the body temperature that is above them. Obviously, this is not an external appendage, but a part of the body. To be exact, it is like an organ. If you use something like a metaphor, it is like a scale on a fish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These filiform red objects are interlaced and form an incredible shape on the back of Elna, revealing a strange atmosphere. This shape seems like the magical array that Kim sometimes uses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leif touched these hard red teeth with his hand, but the therapist suddenly moved up and scared him like an electric shock. Retract your hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you seen it?" Alna sat up with her hand in her hand, and asked quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, I didn't mean it... I thought you were hurt... I really didn't mean it..." Lev hurriedly explained, but love Erna interrupted his words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you seen it?" The therapist's voice improved a bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Yes!" Lev replied, and at this moment he felt that it was better to answer honestly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How come?" Lev replied loudly. There was a scornful and hostile smile on Elna's mouth, which made his heart suddenly sorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Alna looked at Lev and seemed to be checking the credibility of his words, and then her expression slowly eased. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you still looking at it?" After a while of silence, Elna finally broke the silence. "I want to change clothes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leif’s face brushed red, and he quickly turned and leaned against the rock wall. When there was a change of clothes from behind, there was an uncontrollable appearance in his mind that Elna had just covered it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people marching in the mountains. After disposing of the three bodies, they knew that they could not continue to hide. Although Erna is still weak, she insists on leaving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leif walked behind and watched the therapist struggle. He tried to reach out to help her a few times, but in the end he still dismissed the idea. This is a sense of distance. Suddenly, there is a layer of walls between Erna and him, but the saddest thing is that the thieves don't know how to break the walls that are now discovered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since leaving the cave that was temporarily hidden, the two did not say a word. Although Lev wants to open the topic, every time he comes to his mouth, he disappears inexplicably and can't say anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Have a break!" After bypassing a small hill, the thief finally broke the silence between the two, although in reality it was obvious that the fatigue was The therapist who was seriously ill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alna found a clean place to sit down. Now wearing her is an old dress - out of a certain talent of women, Erna always carries two pieces of clothes that can be worn in her backpack. Lev remembers this dress - because it has been kept in Elna's backpack for a long time, in fact, since the first time they met, this dress has been placed in Erna's backpack. After traveling together for so long, Lev inadvertently saw this therapist's gown, but only at that contest, after the opponent cut the clothes, Elna only passed once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leif also sat down, he looked at his feet with some restlessness, but he looked at Elna from time to time, but the therapist always turned his gaze In the distance, he did not care about Lev. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it strange?" Elna suddenly spoke, almost scaring Lev. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes..." The thief finally recovered from the initial surprise, and Erna’s words were gone, but Lev knew what she was talking about. He lowered his head and did not dare to look up at Elna. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I...when I was born, I had that thing..." Elna’s voice was lowered a bit, and the tone changed, and it began to become gloomy. And full of a kind of sadness. "They said that part of my blood is not human... This is proof of the demon's blood... My mother and I have a demon together..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Demon..." When it came to the demon, Lev immediately remembered the encounter with the Treasure Treasury that night. The damage that the Sayādaw made to him casually was a very unpleasant and unforgettable memory. The feeling could not be described. Suddenly the whole consciousness seemed to be squeezed out of the mind, and the body had a huge pain. It seemed to be clipped by the blacksmith with a tongs, and then put on a felt board and hit it with a hammer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Is it scared?" Elna said softly, interrupting Lev’s ideas. Lev suddenly looked up, but Elna’s gaze did not look at him, but cast it in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...How come?..." Lev replied. But Elna suddenly turned her face and looked at Lev face to face. The look looked like a sword, and she ripped Lev’s line of defense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...but because of this lineage, I have a very powerful force..." Elna turned her face back and smiled softly. “I was qualified as a therapist when I was 12 years old – and people of my age are still doing the most basic training...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the temple, almost everyone is afraid of me... Wherever I go, people are separated, watching my eyes are like watching monsters... Do you know the prayers? No matter which therapist has only one prayer to call The power of the goddess, only I have two - because I am not human at all. I have been with you, but this is deliberately pretended, I have always limited my power to the extent that no one is suspicious! Now think of me Is it terrible? Very..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Listen," Lev pointed his face toward Alna, staring at her eyes. "Don't look at yourself like this, you are not like you said... you are a therapist, your hands have always been used to save people, not to kill people! Why do you want to see yourself so terrible? I know Elna, the one who will bury the bodies killed by the half-orcs in the middle of the night... If you count monsters like this, then in this world, who dares to say that he is not a monster?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alna has wide eyes and her eyes are full of horror. She had never seen the impulse of Lev, and although Lev’s hand was very tight, she did not struggle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe you are a little different from others, but what does it have to do with you? This is not your fault at all, and has nothing to do with you..." Lev swayed Elna's body hard, and his movement slowed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, I shouldn't have been like this. I was so excited..." Lev released his hand and took a step back. He bowed his head apologetically and re-sitting to his position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leif sat silently, and the avatar began to look at his feet. After the impulse, I regret it. Just now, he treated her so rudely. Elna is likely to be angry and angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lev!" The therapist's voice finally sounded, but there was no such anger. "Where should we go now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah...to the west...there were a few Leite soldiers coming from the east, then we should go west It’s been six days, it’s been six days, they can’t block the road level for so long. Even if there is, we’ll be able to pretend to be adventurous if we’re a little disguised...” Lev replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Would we go to the temple after leaving? If other people have nothing, they should also go there to release the curse of Wei."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay..." The thief looked up a little, and found that Elna’s face did not have any anger that he thought would be there, but another Different expressions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I feel very hungry now, how about we eat something first?" Looking at Leif’s expression, Elna couldn’t help but laugh. stand up. This smile made Lev’s eyes straight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course it can be..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The East only reveals the first touch of white belly, but the magician who has not slept is already awake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He dreamed of illusion training on Undead Island. These days I have always dreamed of the scenes in those illusions, and I also remembered the battles that seemed to be real when I walked. But that is illusion after all, and the situation inside is just what Nubis thinks will happen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In illusion, when the enemy rushes over, Kim always has time to complete a spell, and he can always use a big magic mixed with illusion. Keep a lot of enemies - but the reality is different. You often find the hostility when the sword or fist falls on your body, and the warriors who are red-eyed are still sprinting without fear if they face the sea of ​​fire! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold suddenly remembered his question about the teacher a long time ago. At that time, he had just lived in the Stone Tower, and he always imagined that he would immediately learn from the big magician that he could immediately deal with all the enemies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher, what magician is the fastest? Fast and effective ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fast and effective?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, can be done in the enemy I used it before the magic, so that he didn't even have the chance to defend. He knocked him down at once..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...haha...there is something similar ...but this is not magic..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is that?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
