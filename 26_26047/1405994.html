			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 01<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two adventurers look at the people who are fighting each other, they say no The feeling of coming out of my heart - whether it is disgusting or poor. People are hostile to each other who can join the first batch of people - they should have been friends with the same illness! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this kind of struggle will not have a result, because of the lack of an authoritative voice, all people think that they are more qualified than others to be saved first, all People have weapons that can threaten others - loud shouts, so no one can go. The careful arrangement of the Orcs - including breaking up the grouping, draining the captives' energy so that they have little means of communication, cruel repression - finally played its due role. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adventurers face the dilemma - if they want to take away all humans - which is definitely beyond their capabilities - is impossible But if only a part is taken away, the rest of the people will not agree, and if this continues, the half-orc will be awakened unless it is dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If someone keeps a clear head at this time, he can definitely find a strange thing, even though the sound inside the tent is quite large, but the two at the door The half-orcs were not woken up, and the snoring continued. If you are normal, the two adventurers will feel very strange, but now they have no time to take care of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voices of the prisoners’ arguments woke up some other prisoners, and the adventurers knew that if they didn’t make a decision, they might have to take all of them. Captive, the adventurers only announced that they would take them all at once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adventurers walked out of the tent with their captives. The two guards outside didn’t know when they had found a place to be lazy. This is a great opportunity. Kim knows that his power is not enough to allow all people to hide under the protection of magic, simply do not use magic, keep the magic spare, just in case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outside is the same darkness as when Kim came in, but the torches lit up when most of the prisoners (wake up) walked out of the tent. More than sixty orcs were found in the light of the torch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one standing in the middle of the half-orc is the leader. After discovering the water bag of unknown origin in the daytime, he secretly noticed. In the evening, he specifically asked two confidants to go to the gate of the tent to stand guard. He knew that something happened this evening. But what happened was beyond his imagination. He wanted to catch a sly man who sneaked out of the tent, but he did not expect to have escaped from a prisoner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold has magical protection, so when he came in, the two orcs who were sleeping were only seeing a blurry figure they only thought was an illusion. But then the sound in the tent made them know the truth of the matter, and when Lev began to lift the bondage of the captives, the two orcs sent a letter to their chief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This way, when the adventurers walk out of the tent, the Orcs are ready. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s over! This is the first reaction of the two adventurers. Now is not a question of saving people. Now I must save myself first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several half-orcs waved the terrible whip, and the fear brought by the whip caused many prisoners to return to the tent, and most of the prisoners were ordinary. The citizens, the rest are also the garrisons that will only be a blessing, and the half-orcs are unrelenting to the regular soldiers who dare to resist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orc’s leader looked at the dozens of frightened prisoners, their expression made him feel very enjoyable, he believed that this little escape could be It was suppressed in his hands. The action of captives shows who is a dangerous person. Only two of those prisoners did not cringe, and others hid behind them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two adventurers exchanged their eyes and they could communicate with each other without language. They already know what they are going to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orc leader’s wave, a few half-orcs slowly surrounded the adventurers, their faces with a cruel smile, in them In the heart, these two people can't escape. But they forget that the adventurers who are good at fighting are not good to deal with, especially their mixed soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the loud sound of the blasting ball is enough to pull all the people, including humans and half-orcs, back from their sleep. If the adventurers can't break out immediately, they can't escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-orc who lost the sergeant rushed over to the adventurers with fury, and once they approached, they could only attack the magician and not be good at melee. The thief can be dead. In order to prevent the thief's hidden weapon, the half-orc shields the shield in front of the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the Orcs rushed over, Kim had only released two fireballs and turned the two orcs into fireballs, but could not stop the approach of the Orcs. . Lev did not have much. He sent out six knives. Only one shot hit the body of the half-orc, and the others were blocked by the shield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no choices for the two people, only to escape to the back, because the shield to protect the body has also become a rush of catching up, the half-orcs can not run very fast, temporarily chasing Not on them. Now everyone has to thank the deceased officer. Because he only mobilized his own men, the adventurers still have the space to escape. If he reports things, then the adventurer can't escape now. A few captives fled with adventurers, and Mink was one of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold knows what to do in this situation, and he keeps on putting the fireball in all directions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chaos happened right away. The Orcs were awakened from their dreams and saw the fire and yelling outside. Their first thought was naturally that the enemy started the night. Attacked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know who was the first to call the word “night attack”, but there was not much time for this voice to have been heard throughout the military camp. The half-orcs rushed out of the tent in a negligent manner, holding weapons in their hands and trying to meet enemies that did not exist. When the captives heard the voice, they all began to riot, and the half-orc guards reluctantly suppressed these powerless actions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the center of the Orc Barracks, in the tent of the King of the Tooth, Göller was also awakened by this huge commotion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Geller has been in a bad mood in recent days, and the pain on his shoulders is not the main reason. This time, the attack and defense of Hope City made him feel sad - his most loyal friend and the most powerful subordinate Bagra corpse on the wall of Hope City, while losing 8,000 of the most brave honor soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This blow and the injury on his shoulders made him sleep well for several days. Geller’s rear is not stable, and the half-orc is temporarily convinced that it is only the legendary God of War in his hand. He urgently needs a big victory to consolidate his not very stable position, but this victory The cost of (although not taking down Hope City, but undoubtedly a big victory) is too great. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when the voice of the riot came, Göll immediately got up and dressed and walked out of the tent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of "night attack" came from all directions, and the disciplined mad beasts also had some confusion, but when the king of teeth appeared, the chaos stopped. The soldiers of the Wild Bet Corps have been strictly trained. They are not as flustered as other half-orcs, but they are quick and calm, and they are ready to attack the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chaos in the Orc Barracks did not help much for the two chaotic adventurers, anyway, they are now in the group who lost their heads. The orcs are chasing each other. Lev's flying knife is now playing a huge role, as long as there are half-orcs who want to give up the shield to speed up, it is difficult to escape the blade of the flying knife. So now the Orcs still can't catch up with these fugitives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the current chaos of the military camp, it’s a miracle that they didn’t encounter the half-orc’s interception, but now luck is finally over, and a group of people appeared in front of them. The half-orcs, from the fact that they did not wear armor and only took weapons and shields, they can see that they have just been awakened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the humans rushing ahead, the half-orcs raised their weapons and prepared to fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is really over, but Lev still sent two flying knives to hit two orcs - the body without armor is a shield and there is no way Protected - but now he has no chance to use a flying knife, he immediately pulled out his short sword. Kim sent out a fireball and turned a half-orc into a barbecue, but this is no longer useful. The half-orc has completely surrounded five human beings, and they can't escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kim wants to use a magic in tension, but the more nervous the magic is, the harder it is. The Orcs recognize that this is a magician. They know that they can't let him use magic. The former half-orc is rushing. The magic of gold can no longer help him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gerler also regarded the chaos in the camp as a real enemy to steal the camp. After the mad beasts were listed, he began to consider What enemy is attacking him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it human? Impossible! The Griffin has been monitoring the vicinity of the army. It is absolutely impossible for the human army to escape this complete and rigorous reconnaissance. Is it..." Göll made the worst plan - there was a rebellion between the half-orcs, and now it is the rebels who attack him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 02<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The whole army is slowly advancing!" The mad beasts began to slowly advance forward, and each soldier clasped his weapon and prepared to fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A half-orc waved the axe in his hand and chopped it to the gold, and the gold flashed to the side - a magic in preparation soon disappeared - but the half-orc Immediately, he used his shield to slam into the gold, just hitting Kim's right arm. Under this fierce impact, Kim Min Jong retreated, and all of it was supported by Ming Ke, so he did not fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next to Lev is also in distress, and several half-orcs surround him. Although Lev is agile, he is also dangerous, his short sword is half The orc is as powerless as a toy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gold did not stand firm, the two half-orcs rushed from both sides, and the two steel knives ruthlessly slammed into the head and waist of Kim. After all, Kim has not experienced any training of fighters. The dodge is just out of instinct. The two knives are impossible to hide anyway. Even Jin himself closed his eyes - anyway, he has already killed enough. In fact, it is not a loss to die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blade fell on Kim’s body, but it was bounced by a mysterious force, and the half-orc looked at the magician who was invulnerable. After they returned to God, they immediately cut the second knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expected steel knife and body did not appear, Kim felt very strange, he opened his eyes, surprised to see a body around his body Protect magic, a protection spell that can withstand all damage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold immediately recovered from the surprise, he has seen this protection magic many times, and every time he saved his life in the most critical time, The teacher gave him this magic ring is really useful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of Kim is now covered with a radiance. Whenever the Orc’s weapon is cut to this radiance, there will be a wave of fluctuations in this layer of protection. The orc's weapon is losing the energy of the magic ring - but it's obvious that it's still early. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden mind is big, calm down and use the magic, he throws a fireball at an unprecedented speed, hits it in zero distance Two half-orcs, relying on their own magic ring protection, Kim does not have to be afraid of being hurt by his own magic. The two half-orcs immediately became fire groups, but the other half of the orcs then rushed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orc’s weapon kept greeted Kim’s body, but now the gold is not afraid, he gathers the magic to prepare a blasting ball while letting Ming Ke is far from him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If anyone is the luckiest in this white-blade battle, it is undoubtedly Mink. No half-orc has turned his attention to him, so this has no self-defense ability. The little devil was not attacked at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden called Mink away from him while moving outside, the Orc wanted to follow him like a fly. They tried hard to exhaust the defensive magic of gold, but this kind of work would not be fruitful without ten minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Kim confirmed that Lev and Mink were not in the range of magical attacks, he immediately released the blasting ball. At this distance, the Orcs could not dodge. The power of the blasting ball is fully reflected. In addition to the defensive magical gold, the other half-orcs in the power range of the blasting ball have become broken limbs - and it is the black and broken limbs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Kim solved these half-orcs, Lev was in an extremely dangerous state, and close combat was not a thief’s strength, especially a group of fierce The half-orc is besieging. Lev is still not dead because the half-orcs are going to take hold - their weapons have not attacked Lev. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-orcs who are dead are approaching, unlike the batch of half-orcs who are besieging Lev. They are fully armed and will never be merciless. Many of their partners are killed by two adventurers. They are all full of anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold uses a fireball to attack the Orcs, but this distance orcs can clearly distinguish the attack trajectory of the fireball, they easily escape the attack. Kim immediately switched to thunder and lightning, and an electric light knocked down a half-orc to the ground, but this only increased the determination of the half-orc to kill the adventurer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orcs form a big circle to prevent the magician from escaping. If Kim loses the following husband and immediately flees with Mink, the possibility of escape is great. But he has no way to leave Lev, who is struggling, to escape. At this time, the blood rushed to his brain, and he did not expect to leave his companion to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Geller’s command, the line of the Wild Bet Corps gradually moved forward, and half of the orcs joined the battle line. This commotion made the Orcs very confused. But there is almost no loss - after all, there are only two enemies. Geller began to wonder if there were any enemies - there were no bodies on the ground, and the flames only lit in a few places. But he knows that everything must be careful, there must be some reason for such a big disturbance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because there was no substantial threat, after the initial chaos, the Orcs began to regain their senses, the commotion began to decrease significantly, and some of the Orcs resumed their organization. However, in the captive camp, as the prisoners began to turmoil, the chaos remains the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go!" Lev tried to scream. He saw that Kim had wiped out all the enemies around him. If he wanted to stay and save himself, that Will lose him in vain. Lev knew that he couldn't escape this time. He had a lot of wounds on his body. It was obvious that the half-orcs wanted to catch their own lives. In the end, they might have to be crucified alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Kim is not sure of this last chance to escape, he is constantly using "Thunder" (an ordinary Thunder magic, the power is not very strong, only Killing a target) Attacking those half-orcs, although about six and a half orcs fell, but the other half-orcs also completed the encirclement, and Kim could not run now. These heavily armed orcs did not pay attention to Lev, and they all focused their attention on Kim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few half-orc archers who don’t know where they came from. They saw the magician and immediately attacked the blonde. Lee arrow fell to the body of gold, under the protection of the magic ring, the magician was safe and sound, but this was enough for the Orcs to understand the magician's power, they did not want to be the same as usual, but divided into a loose team, It is impossible for Kim to use the same method to deal with these enemies. They will not be concentrated together and will be solved together by an explosive ball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four or five half-orcs first rushed over, their weapons reflected in the cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fireball rushed over to the Orc, but the half-orc threw the shield in his hand, the fireball was met by the shield in the air, a flame surrounded this Wooden shield, but did not hurt anyone. Before the gold used the second magic, the Orcs had already started attacking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mingke is standing in an unobtrusive corner, he knows that the two adventurers who saved him may not be able to kill, now he is In contradiction, on the one hand, he wants to stay to help two adventurers, on the other hand, he knows that he can only become cumbersome. If these two adventurers die here, it is his fault. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A hand appeared in the darkness, grabbing Mink’s mouth from behind and dragging him into the darkness, Mink’s eyes with fear The owner looked, but when he saw the person behind him, the fear in his eyes turned into a surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the gold was surrounded, Lev was no longer able to support it. A half-orc used his sword to fly his dagger, and he immediately wanted to pull it out. A small knife, but this action gave the other orc a gap. He used a spear's handle to knock Lev to the ground. The other half of the orcs immediately rushed to press the thief, although the fee A lot of work, but they finally caught the thief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orcs are proud to look at the thieves who are being subdued. Not far behind them, the magician can’t escape, but the magicians are dangerous. The half-orc does not intend to stay alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no half-orc who notices that there is a shadow behind him, when the half-orc intends to tie up Lev, who is forced to move on the ground, one The figure rushed over, and the long sword in his hand was with the glory of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei reached out and pulled Lev from the ground. The thief immediately picked up his short sword and pulled out a knife at his waist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orcs surrounded by gold are very careful to maintain a distance from each other The free magic will destroy them multiple at a time. Although every magic of gold can destroy an enemy, there is another enemy to fill it up. He has been besieged by four enemies. Under the mammoth of the Orc's sword, the power of the defensive magic that protects the gold body has been greatly weakened. Kim has already been affected by the impact of the sword, and his time is running out.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when the Orcs are concentrating on the battle, some people are attacking from behind them. The first few unfortunate are the archers at the outermost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lev took the quiver from the dead half-orc and put the arrow on the short bow that his companions brought him, now it’s the half-orc Come and taste the taste of this poisonous arrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 03<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the camp of the Orcs, a huge worm appeared. This huge monster with a pair of film-like wings has four sharp feet and two big pliers. It immediately creates a huge mess in the camp. Whenever its pliers are closed, there must be a bad half-orc. Clipped into two segments. This monster ran rampage in the Orc camp, attracting the attention of almost all the Orcs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this Warcraft is just a smoke bomb, when most of the Orcs are attacking this flying giant, in another place, two The adventurer is conducting an unfaithful sneak attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Orcs’ attention was focused on the magician being besieged by them, Lev’s bow and arrow were working with Wei’s sneak attack without paying attention to the half-orcs behind. The cooperation between the two people is seamless. When the Orcs stand closer together, they will be divided into two segments by a sword wind. If they are single, the poison arrows will hit their necks accurately. Two people in the dark had killed more than twenty hapless eggs before being discovered by the Orcs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A scream came out from a half-beast population with iron collars, and the iron collar on his neck played a protective role, Lev’s The arrow did not shoot his neck. But he can only call this sound on the ground - Wei immediately added a sword wind. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei’s last chance to send a few Jianfeng, killing a few before the Orcs had not reacted, and then he rushed to the front. Prepare for melee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orcs have trapped the adventurers, they see another human being - and have killed many of their companions - the half-orcs immediately There was no courage to rush to him, no one or half of the orcs noticed that a small little guy was flying from the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The baby spurts a fire of death, now it can be fired without being squeezed, and it is no longer a short flame, but continuous Spit. The power of this small ball-sized animal is terrible. This time, the spit made more than a dozen orcs become inactive coke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orc looks at this little flying monster with a horrible look, the baby is snoring and gasping, this long spurt makes it breathe. But come, and for the baby who is still not mature enough (there is no full moon from the egg), this vomiting is too laborious, and it is impossible to vomit the flame again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the half-orcs have collapsed, they took the baby’s gasp as a precursor to the next attack, they fled in a scary way, no half-orc dare to try Baby attack. Even the half-orcs who were attacking the gold also fled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei, Lev, Kim, Mink, and the babe with the baby will be together, Lev and Kim are exhausted, only Wei The situation is ok, and after the basic dressing was done to Lev, they immediately retreated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warcraft is being attacked by a half-orc, its leg has been cut off There are also a lot of arrows in the body, but it is still fighting with the Orcs. The attack of the Orcs is getting stronger and stronger, and more and more Orcs join the sequence of attacks. Finally, a brave half-orc climbed the body of Warcraft, he used his own battle axe to slash to the head of Warcraft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to the containment of Warcraft, the adventurers left the Orc's barracks with no danger, they and Elna and Behan - both of them searched from another direction - rendezvous and arrived at their own camp . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gle's battle finally arrived at the center and birthplace of the commotion - The captive camp, now half-orcs can be sure that they have not been subjected to any large-scale attack, but still do not know the cause of the unrest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were several half-orcs in front of them, and the officers arranged them like the other half-orcs to the rear of the battlefield, but Geller was keenly aware of the equipment of these warriors. Very complete, not the same as the other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened!" Geller urged the mount to come in front of these fighters, and he thought these guys should know something! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the king of the teeth personally asking them questions, a few half-orcs are a little bit flattered, of course they say what they know, the source books, especially Exaggerated description of the terrible power of the baby. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answers of these half-orcs plus the previous report on a strange appearance and strange disappearance of Warcraft, Göller inferred what happened - - The sneak attack on the Orc camp is a group of humans whose purpose is to save a very important prisoner. There are magicians and summoners among them. The number may be between a dozen and a hundred. They should now rescue the prisoners. Escaped from the camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gerler’s face is distorted by anger and shame, and his bad mood is now unprecedentedly bad – just dozens of people I dared to attack the army of the half-orcs, but also retired. Not only that, but the entire Orc army was completely in chaos because of this insignificant attack. Geller felt that his face was stunned by a slap in the face - the army he was proud of was so vulnerable that he had no resistance in front of the sneak attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jela! Where is Gera? Let him come to see me right away!" The raging King of the tooth called the lion rider of the wolf cavalry, regardless of How can we not let these bold humans escape? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jella! Go and bring those humans back to me!" The King of Tooth has calmed down at this moment, but his calmness is more terrible than anger, "give I am all caught back! If you can't catch it, you can die! If you don't catch it, you don't have to come back to see me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes! My King!" The sturdy Wan Qichang accepted the command of the King of Tooth. His troops were responsible for the guards tonight. He was responsible for this unrest. It is already very kind to do this. If you want to be held accountable in detail, then he may have to be removed from the position of Wan Qichang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Elna began treating Lev, Gera led the five thousand wolf cavalry to leave the main force in the moonlight. He knows that if he can't catch those adventurous players - it's probably impossible to grab all of them, but in any case, grab one or two to make a difference - their status and reputation will be over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After everyone has handled the baggage - it is not advisable to stay here for a long time. Too close, Behan said: "We may have to go apart better!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I suspect that the half-orcs will not be reconciled, they may send troops to pursue us!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Chasing? How to pursue? How could they find it? Come to us? Also, is it a good idea to run a prisoner worthy of such a fascinating pursuit?" Elna’s statement is a bit reasonable. Others also tend to think of Elna. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This..." Behan said that it was only because of the experience of the mercenary. When using a small amount of force to harass the enemy, in order to prevent the enemy from chasing, The harassed troops will retreat in several ways, but they are not troops now, but a group of adventurers. This method may not be necessary. Behan finally gave up his claim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adventurers immediately left this small camp, this transfer is very correct, about two hours after they left, the wolf cavalry I touched this place under the guidance of the wolf's sense of smell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"General! Their numbers don't seem to be many!" A wolf cavalry carefully investigated the legacy of the camp and concluded that "only about a dozen!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Gera heard the report, she was not happy at all. The number of enemies was small and it was only a bad news. This shows that it is more difficult to catch them. "Distribute! Search around!" He had a glimmer of hope in his heart, and the adventurers had not gone far. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adventurers are now moving fast in the wilderness, they are not going straight back But according to the opinion of Behan, I circled a large circle with a curved shape. This preventive measure has been agreed by everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The baby is hiding in Babe’s backpack. In order to prevent possible accidents, everyone divides the luggage. In this operation, the baby can be said to be the biggest one. When Lev is encouraged by other people's moths, Lev is more scrupulous about this little animal. He was afraid that this monster would spurt a flame on himself, even though everyone did not agree with his thoughts, but Lev stubbornly refused to change his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minck followed Wei, and after getting the necessary treatment, Mink’s body has returned to normal. But he seems to be a more shy one, not talking to other people, but always entangled with Wei. After knowing that Wei is a dumb, she still hasn't changed. She has been trying hard to learn Wei's messy sign language. At this point, everyone did not feel that there was anything strange. Ming Ke probably felt that he was too worried for his adventurers to be in danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After two days of rushing, the adventurers estimate that there is no chase now, they change direction, the goal is the oasis where they left the horse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Weird!" In the days when Lev was talking to Elna about how he had mixed into the captive camp, of course he was how he When the wit decisively deceived the Orc guards and searched all the stories of the captive camp, Behan suddenly interrupted his words. "How come you don't even touch a woman? I heard that half The orc has taken a lot of women!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah..." Lev’s words were stuffed, he had not searched all the camps, and now the cowhide was blown. broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 04<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All women are specially placed!" said Lev When he was not speaking, Mink said with a sigh of relief, "The half-orc brought all the women together and later distributed them to the soldiers as trophies..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "No? The half-orc will look at the human female..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think this is true! The half-orc has a non-hybrid character!" The gold opening interrupted Behan’s words. He saw books about half-orcs while he was at the Stone Tower. Of all the wise races, only half-orcs will not mix with other races. "The half-orc male and any other race-born offspring are half-orcs. In contrast, half-orc women and other race-born offspring are not half-orcs, and there is no mixed-race. And, I heard that half-orcs Evaluation of women and human approximation..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving the silence for a long time, Kim finally broke the silence. "In fact, we should have rescued more people!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Save those 'welcome' we are also left with the selfish guys?" Lev recalled the actions of the prisoners at the time, and there was some feeling in the heart, "They ruined themselves. The chance to escape is really self-confident. Those guys are really worthy of a little!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are just scared! Because they are afraid, they can't believe it. Others, because they are afraid, want to escape early! They are actually very poor!" Kim said in a heavy tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, how did you come! It’s really timely!" Lev had no gold compassion, he no longer wanted to mention those who disgusted himself. The guy, he turned his head and asked Behan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is what we discussed early in the morning. As long as I put the fire in the half-orc's military camp, it is a trouble, they follow the advance plan. - Babe summoned Warcraft to cause confusion, and everyone took the opportunity to join in to support. However, this time the baby can really make a great contribution, I know that he will definitely increase his strength after the mink!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adventurers are marching in the wilderness. Behind them, Gera is dividing his subordinates into ten parts and conducting a thorough search in a very wide range. However, because there is no good grasp of the adventurers advancing. The route, so they are still a long way from the adventurers, and if there are no accidents, the adventurer is absolutely not in danger before going to that oasis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there any discovery?" The commander of the Orc began to feel a little annoyed. He knew it was difficult to catch those damn according to the current method. Muddy, but he has no better way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sir!" A wolf cavalry came to General Gera. "We are not blindly searching for such a blind search! It is difficult for us to seize those adventures." I think we can use another method."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Talk about it!" Gera began to feel a little hopeful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can we wait for the place where the other party will go?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "Yes!" reminded Gera in one sentence. "If there is nothing wrong, their destination must be Hope City! In this case, their chances of passing through that oasis are great..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After an hour, 3,000 soldiers continued to search all the way, and the remaining soldiers led the commanders to the Oasis, the first destination of the adventurers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is that?" The adventurers who are moving are stopping. In the footsteps, everyone looked at the direction pointed by Lev’s hand – in the distant horizon, a black color was condensing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black is getting thicker and more amazing, and it quickly changes from light black to rich ink, and covers the entire range of vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone is careful!" This is not because of knowing what happened, but because of the intuition cultivated by long-term adventures, Lev knows what is going to happen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As magic, the black that is still far away from the horizon is now approaching quickly, without giving the adventurer any time to prepare. Now everyone can clearly see what this black is - a huge storm, strong winds blowing a lot of black dust from the ground, so it turned black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well! Everyone is going down, don't be blown away by the wind!" In fact, this is superfluous, the adventurers are all in a small Behind the mounds, they are separated by a certain interval, and their cloaks are placed on the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In just ten minutes, the storm has reached the adventurer's head from the sky, and the gravel is constantly slamming the backs of the adventurers in the strong wind. Even if there are mounds that can offset some of the wind, everyone still has to hold the ground tightly to keep the body from being blown away. Under this storm, humans are too small. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All those who don’t wear armor are unlucky. As the wind gets bigger and bigger, the stones that hit the body are getting bigger and bigger. The bottom of the bowl is big, and knocking on the body can already cause injury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei is now the best of all people. Because of the weight of the body armor, the wind is now unable to blow him, and the gravel is fundamental to him. No harm, now only he can spare no effort to care about the situation of others, other people are self-sufficient. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei raised his face a little, now he can see the situation of the person next to him, on his left is Mink, this boy is the worst One, his body is inherently thin, although his fingers are bleeding, but the body still does not listen to the slow movement of the back, if this continues, he will be blown away by the storm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mink felt that he couldn’t hold on, and the stone kept hitting his unprotected back, making him feel abnormal pain. His two hands were caught on a small stone protruding from the ground, but his fingers had lost their feelings because of excessive force. The wind ruthlessly pushed his body back, and he rolled it into the sky along with other things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mingke, who is struggling to hold on, suddenly feels that there is a powerful hand that grabs his wrist and floats his body - half of it already in the air - - Saved from the fate of being blown away by the wind. With strong support, Mink’s body finally stabilized, and Wei began to pull the boy’s body forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big storm did not stop at all. The dust in the sky blocked the human eye, even those who were less than two meters apart could not see it now. Wei didn't know what other people are doing now. He barely turned his head and wanted to find a partner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the gap between the winds, Wei finally saw the corner of the magician’s robe, the magician’s luck was very bad, and his lying position seemed to be exactly The gravel and the earth's comfort zone - half of the magician has been buried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, Wei knows that he is the only one who has the strength to help, and he begins to climb over the unlucky gold. He unconsciously let go of the boy's hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minck also noticed that his protector was crawling to another place. He should have been honestly staying where he was, but he didn’t know. Why, he also moved with Wei. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The center of the storm is finally here, the tornado sweeping through everything, this powerful force rolled up all the things on the ground that can be brought up, adventurers The location we chose to avoid the storm was unfortunately on the way to the tornado. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surrounding storm suddenly disappeared, and Wei felt a little strange. He couldn’t help but look up and look around. Wei’s eyes just saw the mighty storm behemoth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first one to be rolled up is Mink. When he saw the body of the teenager being rolled up, Wei couldn’t help but stretch his hand. In fact, he himself knows that this is useless, because it is obvious that he can't escape this time. In fact, no one can escape this terrible tornado. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a considerable distance from the adventurers, the Orc pursuers also found The darkness that appeared in the sky. Unlike humans, the experienced Orcs immediately judged that this was the most terrible black storm in the Orc Wilderness - it was this terrible natural phenomenon that turned the Orc Wilderness into what it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I’ve seen it many times, the Orcs have been busy for a while, they quickly judged the center of the storm, and then chose the shelter with the greatest safety factor. . For the time being, it is impossible for them to continue to pursue. This time there is no storm in this season, but the facts are in front of us. It seems that the storm has also learned to not play cards according to the cards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General General Gera is not reconciled, he is most afraid now that the adventurers have been completely solved by this terrible black storm, so It is absolutely impossible for him to complete the task. Although it is a bit funny, he is now praying to God of War for those adventurers he wants to pursue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the Orcs have just been prepared, the storm has come to their heads<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;第05 Festival<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know if this is the blessing or punishment of the gods, and Mink thinks as he walks through the difficult steps. It is a miracle to survive in such a terrible storm, and there must be God's blessing behind it. However, throwing him alone in this desolate and hot wilderness is no different from punishment. Mink doesn't have any guides (although the general direction can be judged by the sun), and there is no water or food on his body. He can only move forward aimlessly, hoping to meet an adventurer - Although this is very embarrassing hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bruises on the back that were beaten by gravel exude unbearable pain. The sunscreen cloak on the body doesn’t know where to go, hot The sun is ruthlessly grilling his body—but, compared to the physical damage, the fear and despair that fills the heart are even more terrifying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minck has been in this deserted place for almost a whole day, and he now realizes the feeling that he has never experienced before. Throughout the day, he did not see anything with vitality, and he felt as if he had been abandoned by the gods. When he was still a captive, he still had at least some hard-working friends around him, and he could hear some sounds, but now, except for the occasional wind, the land is full of silence - unbearable silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mingke didn’t die all because luck was so good, he didn’t happen to collide with anything that was rolled up by a tornado, when the tornado slowly weakened At the time, he also slowly landed on the ground. When he was awake (in this violent rotation, his body would of course faint), his body was not hurt in the tornado except for some bruises. However, other people did not know where to go. When Mingke woke up, he found that he was alone on a piece of sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky slowly darkened, the sun sank under the western horizon, and in less than an hour, the temperature in the wilderness was transformed from hot to cold. Losing the sun as the main source of heat, the half-orc wilderness becomes dark and cold, and a person is in it as if trapped in a coffin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no trace of anyone else. Mink has almost given up the hope of finding other people. He is just walking to keep himself from freezing. Mink did not bring anything to the fire, and there was not much dry food and water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei Qiang suffered severe pain and pressed his right hand on a stone - he has taken off Leaving the armor he almost never left - he grabbed the dislocated part of his shoulder with his left hand and suddenly made a force. There was a dull voice on the right shoulder, and then there was a strong pain - he finally picked up the dislocated part. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the right hand is still not flexible enough because of the pain, he has already begun to put on his armor again. It’s a good ending to just dislocate a hand this time. You know, he survived from a tornado. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation just now is still awkward - if it is not the protection of armor on his own body, or if it is not the past experience, so that he can remain awake in this storm, It’s not that when you fall into the ground, you release almost all the vindictiveness to cushion, and it’s absolutely impossible to stand still. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The companions don’t know how! Although there is not much confidence, Wei hopes that everyone will have nothing to do with him. The only one who has confidence is the magician. Only the magician can be safe. After a simple packing, Wei began to look for companions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lingering in the mind is the face of the boy who was swept away by the storm, the face full of fear and panic. Wei unconsciously overlapped the image of the boy with his younger siblings. In Wei’s mind, the expression on the face was like the expression of the dead on the pile of corpses. However, Wei actually knows that the boy who is always following him is likely to step on the footsteps of his loved ones. His greatest hope is that Mink is safe and sound with the help of that companion, but in this storm, everyone (theoretically) has no spare capacity to take care of people other than himself. If the boy is dead, then this action will fail - but this is an accident, no one can blame them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wilderness, did not see the shadow of any creature. After finding a big circle, Wei began to use the magic sword to draw a secret on the ground. Even if he could not find a companion, his companion could find him according to the secret code he left behind. Wei has a compass on his body, but he has no way to determine his position, so he decided to use two days to find other people. If he can't find it, he can only go back to Hope City first. This is something that everyone has been negotiating for a long time. If there is an accident, then leave a secret code. If you haven't found it in two days, you will return to Hope City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s dark, Wei collects some dry moss from behind the rocks – these mosses can be said to be the only green in the wilderness, and the only one that can be found Combustibles - then take out the ignited items from the body and pick up a bunch of bonfires. He told the truth that he hoped that this little light in the dark could attract the attention of his companions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General General Gera ordered the troops to regroup after determining that the storm had completely left After the count, he was very satisfied to see that this big storm did not let a cavalry be separated, and the usual training was not in vain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he was about to order to move on, he found a commotion in the soldiers, and then a wolf cavalry with a cloak that was definitely not a half-orc Go to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The side of this cloak is very smooth, and a layer of bright silver paint is applied to it, which can play a good role in sun protection, and the other side has a A layer of soft fine hair. The work of the entire cloak is quite meticulous. If there is such a sunscreen cloak in the wilderness of the Orcs, it is undoubtedly the adventurer he is going to catch up with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where did you find this thing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reporting General, just now When the storm came over, this cloak was brought by the storm. It happened to be drifting around me. I was caught back from the wind! I think this thing should be handed over to you."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
