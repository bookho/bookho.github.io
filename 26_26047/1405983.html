He is making a curse in a net. Just after he finally figured out the direction of his hometown, he just closed his eyes (too tired) and slammed into a bird net. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Excessive belief in the power of magic is a mistake" This is what his teacher told him, but now Kim has some experience. This morning, he bid farewell to his own teacher, the great magician Shuk, and set foot on the way home. Because of his confidence in his own strength, he did not go back in the normal way, but chose to fly back with magic. As a result, the bad luck was the first. Because I was immersed in the memories, I was swayed by the wind. As a result, I thought that I could only go home in five or six hours. Now I have been flying for seven hours. Of course, he was not prepared to prepare any food when he was going to go home for lunch. The result was tired and hungry. Just because there was no wind, he couldn't help but hit a donkey, but just closed his eyes and hit a bird net. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Damn, who put a bird net on the top of the tree, now the gold is completely trapped. He was pulled from the air by the bird net and fell on the big tree. The whole body was caught in the branches and was full of bird nets. His strong and huge body that did not conform to the profession of the magician was now trapped. The main reason. Kim wants to use magic to get out of trouble, but he really can't think of any magic that can remove the body-filled net, remove the twigs that hinder the foot, break the big tree fork that grips his body without hurting his body. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unsuccessfully, Kim was only lying in the tree in such an uncomfortable way, waiting for someone to rescue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Kim is really tired, although the tree is not a comfortable place, but he is still asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Kim woke up, it was already dusk. He was pleasantly surprised to find that a little boy was looking at him under the tree, a child about eleven years old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Child, help me, let me go from here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little boy is agile Climbing up the tree, using a knife to get rid of those nasty nets, the gold of hands and feet to get free quickly quickly got out of the tree fork with their own strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little devil said to Kim in the tone of imitating adults: "From now on, you are my prey, you must listen to me."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Prey?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, my dad told me that as long as it was caught by my net Everything is my prey."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The net is you set?" Gold almost did not kick the rotten fruit on the ground to the little devil's head. However, he still tolerated it. Today he must have gone back. He only went to this stinky house to spend the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do not let your parents lose my clothes." Kim looked at his tattered magic robe, thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, this child named Tommy brought gold back home. Tommy’s home is nearby, a village called Noel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tomi’s parents are not bad, they apologized to Jindao, entertained him for dinner, arranged for him to stay overnight, and assured Kim that as long as the store in the village tomorrow When you open the door, you will buy a new magical robes and pay him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When gold is still in the Stone Tower, the world has begun to change, and war is no longer a distant task. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 992th year of the mainland calendar, the battle for the throne of the Leite Empire ended. The second prince, Victor de Ritter, defeated two brothers and became the seventeenth emperor of the Reiter Empire. He was bent on restoring the former glory of the Leite Empire (the Reiter empire was once the mainland hegemon, almost one has the power of the world, but in the "undead war" more than a hundred years ago, the Reiter empire was greatly weakened. Ten years ago, the Red Alliance declared independence and left the Leite Empire. It directly caused the Leite Empire to lose its influence in the lost continent. He encouraged industry and commerce, developed the economy, built water conservancy, increased farmland, recruited talents, and rectified the rule. At the same time, strive to train the army, manufacture sophisticated weapons, and expand the army to prepare for war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 997, the Emperor Victor began to expand outwards. The first goal was to break away from the Empire’s Red Alliance 40 years ago (40 years ago, About 70 industrial and commercial cities in the southern part of the Reiter empire could not stand the levy of the empire, announced that they had left the empire, and hired a large number of mercenaries to defeat the emperor. Then, in order to unite and not be broken by the empire, they formed the Red Alliance. The alliance business is extremely developed, and its economic power is strong. When it is threatened by the outside, it hires mercenaries to fight for them. Losing this territory, the imperial power has dropped by more than half). After the Chen Bing border, he demanded to surrender to the imperial court in some relatively neutral villages between the Empire and the Union. (Between the Empire and the Red Alliance, there is a neutral zone headed by Burek City, including nearly a hundred villages and towns. Neither an empire nor an alliance.) The alliance reacted strongly. The village of Noel, where Kim is now, is a neutral village. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened in the end? The curiosity of Kim broke out again. After careful searching, he found that all the men, women and children in the village gathered in the Chamber of Deputies, and it seems that they are discussing major events. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone is quiet," the village chief announced in a loud voice "I believe everyone already knows. The Leiter Empire sent an ultimatum and asked our village to ask him." Surrender, and the Red Alliance also sent all night, asking us to join the alliance, no matter which side we choose, it will be attacked by the other side as an enemy. This is a major event related to the survival of the village, so it is up to everyone to discuss "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I recommend joining the Red Alliance, at least the Red Alliance will not tax us, who knows how much the Empire will cost us."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not the case, the Red Alliance does not have enough troops to protect us. If the emperor comes, the destruction of the village is in sight."<br /><br /> The fierce debate began in this regard. The focus of the discussion is not on whether to pay taxes in the future, but which side will win. Only the winners will ensure that the village will not be destroyed by the fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At noon, I finally came to a conclusion - first look at the choice of Berek City and make a decision, and the villagers who reported the letter will catch up in the afternoon. return. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner of the village has no intention of opening a store, so Kim’s new magic robe will not fall, he only stays. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the afternoon, the meeting continued, a villager Pegasus arrived, bringing news of the city of Berwick to join the empire, "The flags of the Self-Defense Forces in the city are It has been changed to the flag of the empire." The villagers who brought the news said this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The party that suggested joining the empire immediately took advantage. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When everyone discussed the format of the reply to the empire, the sentry villagers sent a bad news, an army of the Alliance is approaching the village. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation at the meeting was immediately reversed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the villagers discussed joining the empire or the alliance, an army of 50 soldiers and ten magicians arrived at the entrance of the village and smashed at the entrance to the village. Down, their armor clearly shows that they are the Red Alliance army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The villagers stopped discussing and were afraid to look at the army outside the village. Some villagers are armed, but the troops outside the village do not mean to attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At dusk, the self-defense forces of Berwick City arrived, and they were sure to wear the flag of the empire - a shield with a sword and a red cross rose. The number is three times that of the Alliance Army. They were tied to the opposite side of the Alliance Army, and no one can now leave the village. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, the two armies came to a person, wording hard to ask the village to make a decision to join their side. The discussion among the villagers had no results. Although there were more troops in the empire, I heard that the reinforcements of the alliance will arrive today. At noon, the village head made a decision and got the support of the whole village - by the patron saint of the village (the village can choose a god to be his own patron saint) Sacrifice activities are held every year. Generally speaking, if the gods accept the sacrifice, the patron saint will protect the village from the disaster. Most of the urban and rural people have the patron saint, and the god of fire will indicate the future of the village. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But, the village does not have its own magician?" A villager raised questions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s true that to communicate with the patron saint, you must pass the magician. You can always find a magician from Berek, but no one can be sure of Berek now. The city's magician will tell them the true instructions of God. At the same time, it is obviously too late to find a magician in a distant place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know where there is a magician." A tender voice came, and everyone turned to look at the master of the voice - Tommy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I caught a magician in the woods the day before yesterday."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In everyone’s surprise In the middle, Tommy’s parents explained the situation to everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After some discussion, the village chief thought that the magician could trust, so he gave the task of requesting instructions to the patron saint to gold, and promised him. 100 gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the leadership of several villagers, Kim went out of the village and reached a nearby hillside. This is where the village holds sacrifices every year. The villagers ignited the ritual fire, and Kim drew a magic circle and sat in it, beginning to enter the state of meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spiritual exchange with the god of fire did not take much effort. It seems that the god of fire did accept the annual sacrifices of the villagers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The God of Fire has only one sentence, "This will be the land of red."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold from meditation The state has recovered, there is no one around, and then look at the sky, it is almost dusk. He is full of incomprehensibility to the gods (in fact, most of the gods are like this), go down the hillside and go to the village of Noor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But not far out, dozens of magicians suddenly emerged from the woods and blocked the way. "It’s the former Berwick Self-Defense Force, they want to do it. What? It will definitely not be a good thing, pretend not to see it." Gold turned a corner and walked to the left. But the goal of these magicians is obviously gold, they are keeping up. Kim ran up and he clearly heard a large string of footsteps coming from behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold suddenly stopped, because there was a group of unscrupulous magicians in front of him. It is the Red Alliance! The footsteps behind it also stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold stopped in two groups, and now Kim is very subtly sandwiched between two hostile teams - in front of the Red Alliance's magician ( Their number has increased a lot, it seems that the reinforcements have arrived), followed by the magician of the Reiter Empire. Both groups of people stopped at a distance from the gold. Silence around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The friend in front," an imperial mage who looked like a leader finally broke the silence. "Please tell us the god of the patron saint." The Master paused and saw that Kim did not answer, and changed to a different tone. "If you have misunderstood the gods, we can help you correct it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Gold stared at the magician for a while, and turned back: the eyes of the Alliance Masters clearly stated that they were the same purpose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole situation is now in a delicate balance, and all the magicians, including Kim, are motionless. All the magicians have had actual combat experience, and they know that any flash will be the beginning of the war at this time - of course, except for gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold did not move, he misunderstood the situation that everyone was waiting for his position to be a precursor to the battle. "Now is the silence before the storm, no matter which side first hand I was the first to bear the brunt..." He estimated the strength. He was not sure that he could survive with the battle of these magicians (there were several great magicians), so he found himself a reason to escape. Still waiting for the gods, I can't spend time here" (Gold is not really a brave person). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold begins to recite the mantra "The power hidden in the atmosphere, please help me to blind the enemy's eyes and let me escape the danger" (Gold is here to display A foggy spell, a spell that emits a fog that is invisible to the naked eye in a fairly large space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold did not take into account the consequences of his own actions, the loss of his own magic, the magicians were immediately surrounded by the fog created by nothingness No one can see things one meter away. The mage in the front row can see that the gold is casting magic, but the magician behind it will not work, and they have launched the attack magic (during the match, each magician is ready for a magic to prevent accidents). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, fireballs, light bombs, ice cones, gas bombs, sour bombs, and the like are among the two magicians. The battle broke out and the mage in the front row only went into battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers at the entrance to the village heard the sound of the mountain, and immediately grasped what happened, and immediately killed the other party. For a while, killing the sound everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This battle became the beginning of the famous Burrekla saw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it was dark, the battle ended, but there was no victory. Although the number of Berek Self-Defense Forces is more than the other, the Alliance Army is an excellent mercenary with rich combat experience, and both sides have a lot of losses. Seeing that they could not defeat each other, the commanders on both sides chose to retreat in order to avoid meaningless sacrifices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This battle at the entrance of the village did not affect the village of Noor. The villagers stood on the defensive wall of the village to watch this bloody battle. Many people were shaking and shaking. Fortunately, the two sides held each other and did not attack the village. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold--the culprit in this battle, but fortunately escaped, not even a little injury. He chose to escape before he applied the fog. When the fog was working, he escaped from the selected position with the fastest speed. Before the first wave of the magicians attacked, he fled to a safe place—it relied entirely on his ability to move beyond the magician. Then he circled a big circle and returned to the village entrance to see the battle of the soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold looked at the scene of the battle and knew that it would definitely take a long time. The soldiers of the empire lined up in neat teams, organized battles, and the coalition forces used loose fronts to encircle the enemies. Although the number of people on the side of the league is small, the fighting ability of the Alliance soldiers is significantly higher than the other side. The strength of both sides is half a catty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After both sides retreated, there were only a few hundred bodies on the battlefield, and Kim wanted to understand how much mistake he made. Because of his own misjudgment, so many people die, Kim hates to slap himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the village, Kim told the village chief to apologize to him, and because of his mistake, the village was involved in the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don’t blame, my child," the village chief said, apologizing to God and Kim. "In fact, we have already realized it. Ray There must be war between the Empire and the Red Alliance. Whether you do something wrong or not, these people will start fighting sooner or later. No matter which side we join, there is no guarantee that the village will not be destroyed. However, since our village The area will become a battlefield. No matter what the gods say, we must all flee and flee to a safe place. As long as we are alive, sooner or later we will come back to rebuild the village of Noor." His last sentence was to all the villagers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The villagers accepted the words of the village head and went back to preparation. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the night, after the warring parties cleaned up the body, the villagers squatted in the darkness and carried the sacs, and a group of people fled the village of Noor. On the morning of the next morning, except for the village head, all the villagers had already escaped. The village chief insisted that being the head of a village must leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the situation outside has changed. Just the next morning, the main forces of both sides have arrived. The empire had originally intended to return to the Red Alliance, and the Alliance must not allow the Empire to classify Berek as its own. I heard about the fighting in the village of Noor. The two commanders sent troops overnight. At dawn, the 25,000 troops of the empire and the 19,000 troops of the Alliance rushed to Noel Village. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the morning, the army of the two sides is centered on the village of Noor. The battle broke out quickly, and the emperor first launched an attack. I have never seen such a fierce attack and such tenacious resistance. At noon, the two sides have killed more than 10,000 people. The two sides of the battle issued a retreat order in the evening. Leave a battlefield like a hell on earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The family of Kim and the village chief hide in a very hidden cellar. He volunteered to stay because he knew that without the help of a magician, the village chief could not escape on the battlefield where both sides were vigilant. (Know knows that the two sides had too few troops on the first night and could not surround the entire village, the villagers There is plenty of room to escape, but the number of troops will definitely increase the next day). At the same time, there is also a sense of guilt--after all, it is because of his mistakes that the village becomes a battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top of the horse, the sound of swords, the bloody screams of the soldiers, the drums, the screams of the injured, and various The sound of the magic made the following five people tremble (it coincidentally, the village chief is Tommy’s grandfather, so Tommy is also there), Tommy almost cried out, but fortunately Kim stopped him in time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the sound slowly stopped. Kim estimated the time, it is already night. He said to the village chief: "Tonight is our last chance. Once the war is over, we can't be spared when the winners clean the battlefield." The head of the village and Tommy's parents (that is, the son of the village chief and the daughter-in-law ) All agreed with Kim’s opinion and decided to flee now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five people climbed out from the entrance of the extremely hidden cellar, the outside was dark, and neither side of the battle fired, because the fire was the best bombardment target of the other magician. . Occasionally, a magic burst in the center of the battlefield, illuminating a large field - both sides are afraid of each other's night attack, but in fact both sides have no spare time to attack the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jin took the lead, and five people took the hands of the people in front and joined them in a row. They marched on the road of gold election to the gap between the two armies. A group of people walked silently in the darkness. If there were no unexpected incidents, they would definitely leave the battlefield quietly without being discovered by anyone. Kim believed this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tomi walked in the end, he firmly grasped the mother's hand, followed by the adult's footsteps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five people walked through the village of Noor, which has become a battlefield, and entered the flat square at the entrance to the village. Then an accident happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gust of wind blew, and a flag erected on the body of the standard bearer was blown down, just to fall on Tommy's body. Tomi was screaming out of human instinct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this scream happens in a lively market, it will never attract people’s attention, but now it’s on the battlefield of silence and grass This is enough to attract everyone's attention! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several fireballs immediately slammed into the screams, and although they did not hurt people, they were enough to expose the group of dark fugitives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold understands that the danger is over, he takes a deep breath and asks everyone to be around him and run to the chosen target. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magicians of both armies saw a small group of people moving in the battlefield, and the command they received was to attack all the living people on the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold knows what he has to face, and he begins to read his strongest defensive mantra. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Those who disappeared into the light, hidden in the dark, please listen to my request, please accept my sacrifice, give your strength to me, guard My body strengthens my will and allows me to compete with all things." (Golden is the absolute protective magic, this magic can produce a magic shield that counteracts all energy attacks. The disadvantage is that you must use magic to fill the Destroyed magic shield, at the same time can not resist poison gas and acid, of course, can not resist weapons. This is a high-level defensive magic, Jin can run this song while running, enough to prove that he is not lazy in the stone tower.) Br />/><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is just a layer of black, transparent film-like energy that can accommodate five fugitives around the gold, and the attack is over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fireball, Wind Blade, Explosive Ball, Thunderbolt, Light Bomb.... One by one, bursting around five people, one by one on the magic shield made of gold But five people have nothing to do, absolutely protective magic against each hit attack, but this will only lead to more attack magic. The magicians hidden in the dark were surprised to see that the five people on the battlefield were free to advance in the magical sea of ​​oceans, and they strengthened their attacks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold clearly feels that the magic is getting weaker and weaker, he can hardly afford this advanced defensive magic. Every magic that hits the target squeezes a part of the magic from the gold body. All four found that the magic shields were getting smaller and smaller, they had to move closer to gold, and they ran slower and slower, but this only allowed more magic to hit them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.........<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although you can escape the battlefield as long as you cross a hillside, but gold The magic has reached the limit. He feels that his body is scratched by a knife, his pain is terrible, his eyes are blurred, and he feels a sense of exhaustion that has never happened before him. Even if there is Tommy’s low sob The voice reminded him that he could not fall. The magic shield has also shrunk to a minimum, and all four people are almost glaring at him. They simply can't run fast, and the uphill road is the slowest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attack magic ruthlessly bombarded this live target. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a place where gold is invisible, several magicians understand that it is impossible to kill this without destroying the magic shields of the suspicious elements on the battlefield. A few suspicious elements, they joined forces to cast a great magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A ball of light with countless electro-optics (the thunder of God, a powerful attacking magic mixed with lightning and blasting, only the priest or priest can perform alone, characterized by power With the increase of magic power, you can increase infinitely.) Accurately hit the live target that is climbing. Every point where the electro-optical pervasive attack magic shield makes the pain of gold. His magic has already reached the limit. Now it is completely dependent on physical strength and spirit. Support. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ball of light exploded, completely defeating the magic shield. The huge shock wave swept everything! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the king’s order must be enforced, so I will change the original patrol once a day to morning and evening.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After ending the morning patrol once a day, Ken is back in the office, a kid hired by an adventurer’s union to bring this week’s Adventurers’ Union’s latest Message list" sent to his hand<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Become the captain on this point, be willing to think like thisHe drank a cup of tea and sat comfortably on his chair, holding tea in one hand and starting with a message in one hand.The Adventurer's Union is a fairly large organization on the mainland. Its main function is to bring together the latest things happening on the lost continents through the pervasive message network, and pick out the useful ones for the adventurers or mercenaries. Information (except for the most precious news, of course), made "the latest news from the mainland", and then sold to adventurers or ordinary people at a certain price (similar to newspapers)In order to please the defending force commander, the Division of the Adventurers’ Union of the city gave Ken a free newsletter every week, and hired a child to go to Ken’s office.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first article on the message clearly states "The Reiter empire defeated the Red Alliance's army and captured Berek"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh?" Ken is a bit strange. "So fast, it’s time to win.""He thought he would have to play at least two months."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This month, the entire lost mainland is concerned, are discussing the battle of BerekAfter all, for those who are far from the flames of war, such a large-scale war that has not been seen for more than a decade can satisfy curiosity.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of March 1973, the Emperor Victor II of the Leite Empire submitted to the city of Berwick and the nearby towns between the Reiter Empire and the Red Alliance. The instrument, asking them to merge into the Reiter EmpireFive days later, the city of Berwick was changed to the empireThe next day, the Red Alliance sent an army into the vicinity of the city of Berek, and the next day in the village of Noel and the Berwick City Self-Defense Forces clashOn the second day of the conflict, the empire and the army of the Alliance rushed to the village of Noor. There was a fierce battle between the two sides. Both sides suffered heavy losses. Finally, both sides chose to retreat.Two days later, the Red League hired eight mercenary groups with heavy money, and the Emperor was not prepared. He raided the city of Berek and drove the forces of the empire out of the area of ​​Berek.On March 17th, Victor II took the lead and led the main force to attack the city of Berwick.The two sides fought a day under the city of Berwick, no matter what the outcomeIn the evening, under the cover of the hidden magic of the great magician, York Ray, Victor II personally led the elite troops to attack the enemy camp in the night, defeating the mercenary group of the Red Alliance, killing the enemy almost completely, and winning the battle. Burek CityOn the 22nd, a mixed corps of self-defense teams from various cities in the Red Alliance rushed to the Berek area and merged with the remaining forces. The Red Alliance handed over the command to experienced veterans with "black dragons". GaryGary used the guide to lead out the hole, and with a small force, Victor II, who was in the city of Berwick, was taken out of the city, and the main force sneaked in. On the 25th, he again captured the city of Berek.At this time, including the city of Rol, all the comments on the mainland believe that this war will become a protracted war.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ken read carefully the message list in his handThe description of the battle on the newsletter makes Ken, who is a warrior, feel excited.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March 29, 997, the emperor of Victor Emperor and the Alliance of the "Black Dragon" Gary Commander under the city of Burek Fighting, the two sides are evenly matched<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 30th, Victor adopted the strategy of the great magician York Ray, and spread a lot of rumors.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty-one, the complex alliance army is affected by rumors, the military heart floating<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On April 3, the army’s military turmoil, Gary was forced to retreatAfter being chased by the emperor, the loss was great, but the main force retreated to the alliance.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On April 5, Victor II announced to the nations that Berwick was in the EmpireBurleigh's sawing war endedI’m sorry, but in his heart, he can’t participate in this battle for himself Feeling lost<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ken is a very good knightAt the age of eighteen, he graduated from the Warrior Academy with the first place and then joined the army.After a short period of military life, he passed the exam and became a knight (the difference between a knight and a swordsman is that the knight must be proficient in riding, can use a variety of weapons, and must also have the courtesy of the knight. Obeying the knighthood, and the swordsman does not have so many requirements, becoming a knight is more trouble than becoming a warrior - note: it is not difficult to trouble - more)Two years later, he successfully passed the advanced knight's exam (this, Ken thinks he is lucky, because in an accidental opportunity, he got the guidance of a sword-level warrior, learned to use the sword wind, otherwise there is no He will never become a high-ranking knight for ten years, and he will be promoted to an officer of the Gaftwar Kingdom (if he is not a nobleman, he can only become an officer if he has the qualification of a knight or above).A year ago, Ken won an impressive record at the contest held in the Gaftwara squad, and was appreciated by the king. He jumped from an ordinary squad leader to the captain (the Kingdom of Gaftvall) The military establishment is a decimal, 10 teams, 1000 battalions), and successfully transferred to his hometown - Rohr City as the defending force commander<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ken took the sword, and after reading the newsletter that made him bloody, he felt that he should dance the sword to calm the blood of his boiling warrior (it is a militant). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he took the sword to the military camp, he planned to find a few people than the sword. As he walked through a pub called "Dream Cat" in the city, he heard the sound of a fight inside. Then he saw a man being thrown out of the pub. His unstandardized uniform clearly showed that he was A mercenary. Willing to stop and turn to the door of the pub. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a big fight in the pub, more than a dozen alcoholic and drunks, but when they noticed wearing a armor, headband helmet, When the officers armed with the sword entered the pub, even their brains anesthetized by alcohol understood what was going to happen. These people fled from the window or the back door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ken felt a little disappointed. To be honest, he really hopes that several of these fights will rush up and attack him so he can A show of martial arts. However, when these cowardly ghosts saw an officer, they immediately got a large team of armed soldiers rushing in. They couldn’t even fight on the shelves, and they ran all the way. In addition to the troublemakers who were beaten up, the idlers who were hiding and watching the lively, immediately ran to the tavern boss who said that he was thankful, plus a guy wearing a black robe, still drinking nothing, the pub did not Other guests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ken is not interested in chasing the guys who escaped. He is impatient to listen to the boss’s lengthy thank-you words, is planning to leave, and a team of soldiers to maintain order Come in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader of the soldiers salutes Ken, willing to wave their hand to let them do their own thing, and then take the door of the dream cat (in the lost continent, there is no police Occupation, policing is the responsibility of the military). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ken will continue to walk to the military camp, but he has not yet gone out of ten steps, a dull voice let him turn his head back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another person was thrown out of the pub, this time the leader, he looked very heavy, and soon he couldn’t stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Ken rushed into the tavern, the soldiers were holding weapons, surrounded by the weirdo who was drinking, and the boss stood on one side, shaking his feet stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ken immediately understood what was going on: the boss saw that a few drunks didn’t have enough money to pay for his loss, so he told the leader the geek It was also a saboteur. When the leader asked the foreigner to go with them, the guy threw him out of the pub. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ken going forward, standing in front of this weirdo, the soldiers formed a semicircle behind Ken, using their weapons to point to the dangerous characters in front of their sergeant . Ken began to look carefully at this person in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This person is wearing a magical robe that looks black. Maybe this magical robe was once another color, but I can’t tell if it was white or not. gray. He was still drinking because of the dim light in the pub and that he never looked up and couldn't see his face. From the naked arm of this man, he is a very strong guy, his hand is as strong as the blacksmith's hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ken to announce loudly to the people in front of you, "The Lord attacked the soldiers of the city and committed the crime of obstructing official duties. I will come to represent the city of Rohr...." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person in front of him looked up and he looked like a lonely traveler. But Ken swallowed the words "arrest you". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gold!", he recognized his childhood friend, and he rushed up and hugged the trainee magician who was almost thicker than himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These days are the happiest days for Punk Kali, the owner of the “Lol City Suburban Grocery Shop”. Five years ago, the old punk son of the old punk left home on the first night of his return home from the School of Magic. He also left a letter stating that he was going to pursue his ideal as a magician. This incident made Old Punk stunned and consciously inferior in front of the neighbors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the second year, his second son, John, came back from the Skills Academy and learned a good iron-handling technique, and then opened a blacksmith shop in the village ( If Kim becomes a blacksmith, John will inherit his father's grocery store. This will give Punk's face a radiance (the ideal of a countryman, hehe). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, just three days ago, accompanied by the commander of the defending forces in the city of Rohr, the greatest pride of the village of West Delico, accompanied by Ken Mide, Kim is back. This incident became the big news of the whole village. Kim seems to be quite lonely, and must have suffered a lot of frustration outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kim lies on his bed at home, if you think about it. He met his former playmate in a pub three days ago, and was forced to pull to the home he did not intend to return. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold is not the teacher who just said goodbye to the teacher, the trainee magician who just took the young man’s self-confidence and hope for the future. A month ago, due to his reckless behavior, he provoked a war (this is not his fault, whether there is gold or not, the alliance and the empire will definitely play one game), one can escape the war The village became a battlefield. The most important thing was that he had killed four innocent people because of his lack of ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold really wants to die with the village head family on the hillside, so that he can not live in jealousy and remorse every day. It is entirely luck that Kim can survive. His teacher, the magic ring given to him by the great magician Shuk, saved his life. The specific situation Kim did not remember, because at that time the consciousness of Kim was very vague, he probably knew that the ring played a role at the last moment, surrounded him with a defensive magic, so that he did not die under the thunder of God. . But before he was stunned by the shock wave (the thunder of God is really powerful), he saw a scene that made him unforgettable. The child, Tommy, made a bloody fog in front of his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the afternoon of the next day, Jin Qing woke up and the two armies had retreated. He looked at this battlefield and realized the gods in an instant - the whole village They all turned red, red stained with blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine how self-blame Kim is, if it’s not that he stupidly caused the fighting between the two armies, or if he proposed to escape last night, the village chief’s family would Will not die, these war dead will live well, all his fault. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold does not know how he got out of the battlefield, and how he returned to the city of Rohr. He only knew that he was blindly walking in the past few days, at night. Then I couldn't sleep, and when I closed my eyes, I saw the scene where Tommy turned into a bloody fog in front of his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To be honest, this blow almost completely destroyed the confidence of Kim. When he first came out of the Stone Tower, he was full of confidence in himself. He even planned to return home with flying magic, and then landed in the amazing eyes of his parents and neighbors, so that everyone knew that he, Jinka Lee, has become an amazing magician. However, after experiencing this blow, he doubted his ability and even suspected that he chose the magician profession is not correct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this state of regret, self-blame, and pain, Kim returned to the city of Rohr. The depression in his heart could not be eliminated, so he went to a pub to drink wine. He only had a cup of drink, and he did not notice the situation until he was pulled by a military officer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold threw the guy out of the pub. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Kim started drinking again, another officer walked over to him, and when Kim was going to throw him out, he hugged gold. And also called his name, at this time, Kim recognized, the officer in front of him is Ken, the Ken who went to the Warrior Academy, the friend he has not seen in the past ten years! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While disregarding his protests, he pulled him back to his home where he thought he had no face to go back. On that day, Ken did not go to his night patrol, staying with Kim, listening to Kim said his experience, and comforting Kim. He tried hard to get the gold back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that day, after the willingness to leave at night, the old punk told Ken about Kim’s recent situation. He said that Ken is already a senior knight and is the defender of the city of Rohr. The commander of the unit, and told Kim, Ken is the pride of the entire village, and Kim is a magician who has no light on his parents' faces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Punk said, of course, wants to let Kim give up his unpromising career (in the eyes of old punk), but it makes gold more emotional Low. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold stayed at home for three days without a step, Ken came to comfort him every day, and finally let him recover a little spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold is lying in bed now, he is thinking about what he heard today—Mimi has married Ken. Mei Mi is the object of Kim’s secret love in a young age. Ten years of time has ruined his love for the beautiful young boy of Mi Mi, but after all, he did not completely remove the beauty from the heart of Kim. The depths of Kim’s heart still have a little thoughts on the brown-haired girl, even in the Stone Tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Everything is over," Kim said to himself. "If I went to learn to be a blacksmith, now maybe Mimi is my wife!" "But if this is the case, I am afraid that I will not have anything to do with magic in my life. Magic, Kim immediately thinks of magic, right, even if he loses Mimi forever, even if he is not understood by his parents, even if he Not so successful, even if he died because of his fault, he still loves magic. He entered the School of Magic in the second year, he was attracted by this mysterious technology, his life, I can't leave the magic anymore (the extreme fascination with magic is the main reason why Kim succeeded in the future). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe it's self-deception." Jin Xin thought, but as long as he remembered Ken's conclusion, Kim would feel much better in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "First live at home for a while, review the magic well, and then plan." Kim made a "no filial piety" decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The father who sent gold outside, Punk Kali’s voice, "Ken, come to see Jinla today?" Then, Ken came in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ken is also very happy these days, just like the old punk, but the reasons for his happiness are different. First, his childhood friend Kim came back. Although Kim’s mood was very low, he was back. Second, he received a notice yesterday. He has been appointed as a general and will go to the Kingdom Capital one month later. Third, that is, the purpose of his coming today, he got an important intelligence from the adventurer's union, a group of bandits, probably the remnants of the mercenary group defeated in the battle of Berek, somehow, actually passed Heavy levels, came to the vicinity of the city of Rohr, and also robbed several villages. Ken intends to eliminate this group of bandits before leaving the city of Rohr. When he thinks that he can fight for the country and the people, Ken will be very excited (it is really a militant). He is here today to ask Kim to participate in this military operation, because Ken believes that playing a victory will definitely revitalize the gold (the knight's idea), and at the same time, the joining of a magician will greatly increase his combat power. (Before, due to the custom of the city of Rohr, there are no other magicians in this area). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ken walked into the room and said his thoughts on the gold still in bed. I didn’t expect Kim to reject it<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't want to kill!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What, you are not going to kill, but to destroy the evil bandits!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"......."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Think about it, if you don't destroy them, how many innocent people will suffer, How many villages will be looted, how many merchants will be killed and robbed!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are the remnants of the mercenaries of the Red Alliance, one of the murderers who killed the village chief! Don't you want to avenge the village chief's family?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I am going" Gold was finally convinced by Ken's eloquence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the evening of April 20, 997, an army appeared in the dense jungle of Rohr in the dark. There are more than 300 people in this army. The whole army is quietly on the road. No one has made a sound. From the perspective of their armor, they are the regular army of the Kingdom of Raftwar. This army is the commander of Ken.匪 troops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ken through the Adventurers’ Union, knowing that there are about one hundred to one hundred and fifty people in the bandits, and knowing the location of the bandits’ camps, so he intends to use the superior forces. Go to the night to make your losses to a minimum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ken riding on the front of the team, next to him, is the only magician in this team. Kim walks and looks around with the eye of magic. Case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night, I finally reached the goal. The camp of the bandits appeared in front of the squadron. Kim carefully checked it and determined that there was no danger. With a wave, the army quietly dispersed, surrounded the bandit camp, and then quietly waited for the signal of the attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After confirming that the whole army was in place, a person quietly went to the camp. He had to go to see the villagers who had been kidnapped. Kim looked at him nervously. A fireball is ready, and with a little accident, he will fire a ball - the signal of the total attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ken approached the camp, the camp of the bandits was quite simple, and there were some hidden things in the vicinity that I didn’t know where to grab them. Even a sentinel did not. I would like to check the tent. All the tents are similar and arranged in the same way. Generally speaking, the captive tents will be specially placed. From this point of view, there are no villagers caught. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ken quietly returned to Kim’s side and made a gesture to Kim, and Kim put the prepared fireball (the fireball is the lower spell in the fire magic) It is only a little stronger than the fire, it has a little explosive effect, but mainly relies on the flame to kill the enemy) to the camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ken and Kim are standing together, but the two are doing different things. Kim is preparing a super-large range of paralysis (a very practical magic of the body system, which causes some or all of the enemy to lose their mobility), and Ken Then carefully find a stronger enemy, and kill him by yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ken has not found a suitable candidate. Several bandits escaped from the encirclement and rushed to both of them. They found Ken and Kim. Two bandits rushed to Ken, and the other rushed to gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two people who are willing to target are approaching Ken from both sides. They see that the rifle in Ken’s hand is not flexible enough in melee, if he is willing to use a gun One of them would not be able to escape another attack. However, Ken’s reaction was beyond their expectation. He was willing to throw a rifle and accurately prick the bandit that rushed to the gold to the ground, then pulled the sword and rushed to them. He swayed the sword to an enemy in the air. The man was not reacted and was smashed into two pieces by the sword wind. Then Ken will swing his sword to the second. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he was willing to knock down the bandit with his long sword, Kim’s paralysis was also ready. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the battlefield, the battle is nearing the end, only a small number of organized bandits are still resisting, and their skillful combat skills allow them to withstand superior enemies, but This kind of resistance has been useless, and it has delayed the time for the squadron to win. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ken looked at the enemy’s last resistance and felt a little gratified. I didn’t expect the bandit’s fighting power to be so strong. If he used frontal combat, 300 people might still Can't beat the bandits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold exerts paralysis on the enemy who is still resisting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Powerful spells allowed the enemy's final resistance to completely collapse, and even some of the soldiers of the squadron were affected, but the battle finally ended. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the early morning of the next day, Ken ended the search for the wreckage. According to the captives, the bandit was made up of 140 people, all mercenaries. Ken will check it out. Eighty-five people died in the bandit, and fifty-five were captured. Fourteen people were killed in the army, twenty-six were injured, and three horses were killed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After cleaning up the battlefield, Ken is planning to issue a retreat order. At this time, a soldier reports "Sir, and caught a guy!" Soldiers came over with one person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This person looks a little different. He is not dressed as messy as other captives, but is dressed neatly. From the leather armor he wore, a row of knives on the belt (the knife has been confiscated), the short sword used (now in the hands of the soldiers), he is a thief undoubtedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Author's Note: Thieves are lost in a career on the mainland, generally they call themselves "treasure seekers." Thieves are proficient in bows and arrows, in melee, They use short swords, but they try to avoid melee. The thieves are proficient in removing traps, and of course they can set traps. They all have a set of unlocking skills. Although ordinary people look down on thieves, thieves are indispensable in the adventure team. The thieves are inextricably linked to the adventurer's union. Although outsiders think that thieves are the same, they actually have a hierarchy.)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there more than one?", Ken is a bit strange, but since it is here, it must be a member of the bandits. It may be that the captives are wrong, or they deliberately lie. Anyway, they have seized them. Let’s go back and say, Ken. Just put this piece aside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the winning division came back, they were warmly welcomed by the urban people of Rohr. After the prisoners were put in the prison, Ken was connected to the banquet invitation. Can't get away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold pushed away all the invitations, even the invitation of Mi Mi, Ken’s wife refused (because of some unspeakable feelings in the heart, Kim is unwilling Meet with Mi Mi). He quietly thought about his future at home. He finally decided to go down to the adventurer's union to report, then introduce the union, know a group of companions, and carry out an adventure to increase his experience and insight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the third day of the victory, Kim’s parents and brothers did not pay attention, leaving a letter (with no difference from the previous one) The baggage left the house and went to the adventurer's union in the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden walks on the streets of Rol City, and then two more streets to the Adventurer’s Union, but with each step he takes, one deep inside The shadow is getting bigger in his heart. Even three days ago, Kim clearly saw the role of his magic in the battle, the shadow still did not disappear, it was only hidden deeper. Now, this shadow climbs out of its hiding place and is once again occupying the inner world of gold. As the shadows increased, Kim's footsteps became more and more heavy and slow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Can I really assume my obligation when I was taking risks?” Kim said softly to himself, he once thought that the disciple of the great magister would be a great magician, but the failure in the village of Noor made him see the reality. ─ He has the most abilities at all (failure always makes people underestimate themselves). He couldn't imagine the consequences of his incompetence, and the unforgettable pain and remorse once again returned to his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold unconsciously looked to his left, but saw a distinctive building. Kim recognized this as the prison of the city of Rohr. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold walked into the cell, he didn’t know why, if he had to explain his behavior, he probably wanted to go to the adventurer’s union. Do something to restore your emotions first, or you may want to look at the status of those prisoners. After all, a considerable part of them are captured because of gold paralysis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guards in the cell recognized the gold, they politely let Jin come in, and let Kim free to see all the prisoners. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are not many other prisoners in the cell, basically the bandits of the last prisoner. The bandits seem to be very frustrated, and of course there are exceptions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold found that the bandits were divided into two batches, most of which were on one side. Although they saw the coming magician, they did not react. On the contrary, the other side There was only one person. He saw the magician coming to him immediately. Kim remembered it. He was the last thief who was arrested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"嘿" The thief greeted him. "I remember you, you are the magician of the army. I have been here for the third day. You should also The investigation understands, should you let me go?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold thinks this guy is very interesting, casually saying "No, I just came to see you last, tomorrow morning, You will all be hanged."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone looked up at Kim, and Kim clearly saw the despair in their eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I don't want to die, I am still young, I haven't made enough money, I can't die like this, especially It is dead in the mistakes of others."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold suddenly felt that this person is probably not a bandit. Because he reacted too much to being executed. Whether it is a mercenary or a bandit, most of them are very weak to death. Because when they chose this line, they already knew their own destiny - killing people will also be killed. In particular, the bandits, once determined to become bandits, they must know their future, the bandits are holding the mood of "going out, at most, but a glimpse of the gallows, two eyes". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This young thief grabbed the iron gate with both hands, as close as possible to the trainee magician, and the silence of the magician made him even more alarmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am not a group of them, I am just there, you can't kill me, you have no power to execute a prisoner without trial."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold looked at his panicked look and felt a little fun, but he was still a cold face on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no need to judge, you have entered the Gaftwar Kingdom without permission, and have ransacked three villages and killed more than 50 villagers. Like the mountain, you are guilty of sin and death, and there is a lingering death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold sees his own words and works, those bandits are headless, no longer looking at him, and the young people in front of him But I was even more alarmed, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Trust me, I am not a group of them, my name is Lev, it is a thief, I only passed by that night, I was The soldiers were misunderstood and caught.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden believes that this young thief is not a member of these bandits, but he still has a problem that has not been clarified. Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don’t use these stupid words to deceive people, do you think I will believe the excuse of 'accidentally passing by'? You must be the scouts of these bandits. It happened to be scouted that morning and caught us. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have no relationship with them, not their scouts." Lev was anxious. "I just wanted to go to their camp that night." Get something, because we listened to the adventurer's union and said that they robbed several villages and now they are rich. I killed the sentinel and just found a few gold coins, and you started to attack. Right," Lev suddenly said, "I saw you with a knight on the side of the woods that day. The knight killed three, and it was really amazing. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
