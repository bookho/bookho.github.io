			<div id="content">A gust of wind passed along the avenue, bringing the coolness of autumn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time is nearing late autumn. The land in the southern part of the lost continent has also begun to feel the taste of autumn. There are autumn fruits hanging from the trees, and the fields are golden wheat waves. Feel the coolness of the autumn, watch the scenery on both sides of the road, and add a crisp and delicious fruit to your hand. It is really a very pleasant moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;金 really feels very happy. He was lying on the top of the cart, staring at the apple while looking at the sky. After leaving the desert area, the weather seemed to have changed from a fierce and overbearing tyrant to a gentle and quiet lady, always maintaining a soft face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's delicious... delicious... you should buy more." The black cone enjoys one of its own fruits while jumping around the gold. Jump. It may be a bit strange that the crow eats an apple. Every time it uses a cockroach to clean it from the apple, and then swallow it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are one person, less nonsense." Golden eyes looked at the sky. This kind of good weather has been going on for many days. Is there anything hidden under the calm? This kind of thought is unfounded, but there is some vague feeling in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s time, young people." The old man who drove the car shouted at the back of the car. Kim immediately climbed up and grabbed the black cone that continued to eat the apple and jumped out of the car. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait, I haven't finished eating yet..." The black cone struggled. Kim immediately stuffed his half apple into its mouth, and the crow of the card could only scream the "呃...呃..." strange sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The front is the green fort." The old man pointed to the front, "Going along the road, the slowest is only two days."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you." Kim looked at the road and took a look at the dust on his body and was ready to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait, young people, forgive me for this old man." The old man looked at the passerby of this ride. "I will tell you once again that this road is not safe. I have heard more than once that someone has been robbed by robbers in the vicinity." The old man looked at the sword on Kim. "Although you bring a weapon, if there are ten or twenty bandits rushing out from behind the woods, tunnels or stones, it is impossible for you to fight against you alone. Also," the old man continued. “Although the Green Fort is a commercial city, it is not a calm place. There is even a slave trade there.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Thank you for your comments.” Kim noticed The black cone had already spit out the apple, so he grabbed the crow and the other hand pushed the apple into the cone of the black cone. "But I also learned a little swordsmanship, there should be no problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So much care, young people. Drive!" The old man turned the horse's head, always Go and go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!" The black cone finally got rid of the half apple. It flew angrily to the head of Kim, slamming the golden face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, wait... don't do this, black cone, I apologize."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It’s too late!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This battle is the result of grabbing the black cone with gold. "I apologize, the black cone. But can you pretend to be an ordinary crow? Don't talk if you can't move? It's easy to cause trouble. You said we must try to be unobtrusive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Abominable!" The black cone screamed and flew into the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold watched the crow whistling on his head and couldn’t help but laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have two more apples here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Umbrella quickly landed. "Look at Apple's sake," it rubbed his mouth at the gold neckline. "Forgive you this time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The old man who kindly let us ride the car said, from here to the Green Fort, it takes a day to two days. We Are you going?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You really have this problem." The black cone continues to eat apples (it puts the apple on the gold shoulder) and answers . "We have been behind for about two months. Do you think that walking can make up for it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green Fort is not a real castle - it doesn't even have walls. There is no wizard as a ruler, nor a sheltered king, but a powerful chamber of commerce. More than one wizard tried to touch the city, but because of mutual jealousy, it turned out to be a real place of freedom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And freedom usually means confusion and corruption. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Standing, where?" At the entrance outside the city, three soldiers were in front of the stranger. Such a normal dress, who does not follow a team or a few companions, seems to be the most suspicious, or, the most deceptive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am coming from the north." Kim smiled, "just an ordinary traveler."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ordinary traveler?" The leader of the soldier will be suspicious. "Is it a long trip to travel?" He noticed the sword on Kim - even if he did not pull out the sheath, he could still see it. The sword is absolutely worthwhile. Ordinary people should be unable to afford this. This young traveler is dressed in the ordinary, should be to cover up his disguise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes." Kim replied, and he watched the three guards exchange their eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are a smart person, right?" The soldier smiled at the strange traveler. He put a hand out in front of the gold and his index finger twitched twice. "Do you understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold said with a smile that he fully understands this suggestion. He took a shiny thing from his pocket and put it in the soldier's hand. So the two sides laughed together and smirked each other like many good friends. The three soldiers let the road open, and let this stranger come from the suspicious people into the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why did you just swallow it so much?" The black cone was dissatisfied with the golden face. "You should give them some lesson."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No need. Even if the lesson... can't change anything." Kim looked at him with some exclamations. Crowd. If Yinye Town is still a vibrant town, then it is like a mature and rotted fruit. The shemale and prostitute who are full of makeup are openly standing on the side of the street, seduce the guests with arrogance. The cockroaches are all over, reaching out to the indifferent crowds. But if there is such a pity hand that happens by chance, they immediately swarm like a fluff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the most people on their faces are expressionless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a corrupt and luscious city." It noticed the expression on the golden face. "What's wrong? Kim, picking up the spirit, it looks very good here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The last time the businessman said that if there is goods shipped to Qianhucheng, Then it will definitely pass the Green Fort." Jin said to himself. "Although there should be no change in direction, but for safety, let us inquire about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This time, please don't tick others Curiosity and greed. In addition, "The black cone said, "You have too much money on your body, use some of it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Use? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you don't understand, let me teach you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You intend How to do it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The first step is wine and food! Right, it’s best to add beauty.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want to add a beautiful crow?" Gold digs hard. But the black cone does not care. "Enjoy, you need more guidance! Come, go here," it pointed to the largest building in front with wings. "My experience tells me that there is everything we need."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said, we should better consider how to inquire about intelligence." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do not worry about this," Ubuntu did not care. "There are always thieves in this kind of city - compared to the town of Yinye Town, the thieves here have a lot of credit and ability. And what you have to ask is not a secret to listen to. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Commerce Chamber Headquarters?" Kim read the nameplate and looked at the black cone with a weird look. “Is there a beautiful wine and beauty waiting for us?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Ha ha ha, experience is not necessarily reliable... come, my instincts tell me.” The wings point to another building in the distance. "There can be what we need."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, friend," Kim stopped a passerby on the road. "I ask the house," he pointed to the building pointed by the black cone. "What is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A glass factory." The man glanced and replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wu cone..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hahahaha, I said, when intuition also has mistakes Go over there," Ugly once again chose the target. "My instinct tells me that it is our goal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please ask What?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dressing up the enchanting hostess appeared in the right side of Kim, and gave him a wink when he spoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a fairly high class restaurant. According to the words of the black cone, this is the place where the beautiful wines and foods gather. Travelers like Kim are rarely seen in the four places, most of them are well-dressed locals. The guards in the corner of the corner looked at Kim with vigilance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waitress handed the menu. Was taken by the black cone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want this...this...this...this...this another...this...plus this..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gold originally wanted to stop, but it was too late. He had to let the black cone do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at a bird while jumping around and talking, the waitress showed a surprised look. Other guests have also cast amazing eyes. However, the parties - that is, gold - looked like nothing, and these guests quickly ignored it. Although magical pets are rare, they are not without them. Even if people have never seen them, I have heard of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, have you written it down?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remember...down... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waitress leaves. The black cone is proud to come to the opposite side of the gold. Of course, it is standing on the table, not the chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This kind of thing, still depends on experience."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Experience is not to take us Did you go to the Chamber of Commerce?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tall man came over, half like a guard half like a waiter. He came to Kim in a polite manner and was empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr., the rule here is to pay and eat again." He looked at the ordinary clothes and the neck, wrists and fingers without any decorations - - Generally speaking, the rich will not let these parts be left empty. "The value of what you want is -- two gold coins."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jin reached out and found a few gold coins on the table. The man immediately turned from the guard's vigilant eyes to the flattering respect of the waiter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only two are needed," he repeated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you provide accommodation services here?" Jin asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then the rest will help me prepare a room." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But there is still..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reward to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you, generous adult." The waiter stooped back and re-assigned from "Mr." to "Adult". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You should reward them a little more." Wu cone proposed. “So you can be called ‘His Highness’.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is indeed a decent hotel. From the speed of serving, you can tell the skill of the chef. The dish of the black cone is delivered like water. The contents include a cleverly baked lamb leg, a variety of fine seafood and river fish, a wide variety of fruit products, a fragrant and delicious soup, and a selection of several fine wines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of such a table of delicious food, Kim did not show any interest, he barely touched a few. Instead, the black cone is full of food. The crow jumped up and down in the gap between the plates, enjoying it as he wished, boasting a few words for each bite, and urging the gold to pour it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why are you so happy?" Kim suddenly asked about swallowing a cone of unknown fruit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Why not happy?” The black cone gently swallowed the food, then jumped to the gold and began to enjoy the wine in the glass. "So delicious food and drinks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You slowly I will understand." The black cone cast a meaningful look on the gold. "Since it is a game, you should enjoy the game. Don't let your senses go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My senses?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you can see it, then look good. If you can listen, listen to something moving, eat, eat delicious, play, and play some wonderful... just back "Things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't understand." After a few seconds of silence, Kim replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "All said, you will understand slowly." The black cone turned his head and focused on a fish. If someone carefully watches the whole process, he will be very surprised. Because the black cone eats much larger than his own. The lamb leg is half empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Mr...." A light, timid voice rang from behind the gold. Kim turned his head and saw a very beautiful girl. Golden hair, fair skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you need to listen to the song? Only one copper coin is needed at a time." The girl looked at the dishes on the golden table - nothing else, come from this point Look, the man dressed by this traveler must be quite rich - at least it is quite rich now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold noticed that the girl had an old piano in her hand. She stood in front of Kim, but she could not stop the uneasiness of her face. She should do this soon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay. You sing a song you have."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe the sound of gold And expressions. The girl was cramped and disappeared. She picked up the piano and began to play while whispering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"People of the world,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please listen to the song that has passed away...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Telling about how the beauty of the past is dying,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; telling how the god’s favors are gone.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The land that was once taken care of by the goddess,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; turned into a wasteland in stupidity and arrogance;<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The once glorious temple,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has become the ruins of the magical habitat.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greed from the darkness into horror,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beautiful gardens are shaded,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is low and dark,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horses and the figures are extinct.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is finally irritated by this betrayal and sin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She covered her veil and turned away,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No longer looking back for any pleadings and confession . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind blows, shadows often stay;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The song of hope is taken for violence,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders of the Quartet,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the group of beasts being chased..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The melody of music is beautiful, and the pain and sorrow in the song goes straight into the heart. Many people, including those who are sitting far away, are watching. Maybe this girl sings It’s slightly immature, but what a singer has to do is to impress people. This girl has done it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The black cone also forgot to eat, and stood there and listened to the girl singing.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Very sad song... What is it about? "After the girl stopped, Kim asked.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" is the sad song that the therapists made in the ruins of the temple. The girl replied. "The garden of Leica was destroyed by the king of magic, Brett, and the therapist fell apart under the chasing of the wizards." The residual fled to various places. This is where several therapists returned to the ruins of the Temple of the Goddess of Life, remembering the songs created during the time. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Therapist? "At first the waitress didn't know when she came back. "It's just a legend." She smiled disdainfully. "It is said that they can treat wounds and diseases - it can make serious injuries heal quickly." Even the legend that the most powerful of them can be brought back to life... How is this possible? Can people live when they die? Haha," she laughed. "There is no therapist in the world. It is just a myth." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"" "The black cone whispered, but the sound is light and can only be heard by himself.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A beautiful song, also a sad story. "Gold opened. He took a gold coin from his arms and put it in the girl's hand. "Can you know your name?" Beautiful singer? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My name is 夕娜. "The girl felt heavy in her hand. She only discovered what this guest had for herself. "Sir... I think you got it wrong. You gave me a gold coin." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Xi Na...you are an honest child..." Kim smiled and took out another gold coin in the eyes of the hostess. "The first is to reward your singing, and the second is to reward your honesty. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, sir! "The girl hurriedly thanked her.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My name is Kim. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you, Mr. Jin, may Goddess... May God bless you!" "The girl groaned again. Then she seemed to be a frightened bird, hurriedly ran out of the restaurant door.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is a therapist. "The black cone jumped to the golden shoulder and said secretly. "My experience told me that it must be correct. Although she is still very young. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold didn't answer, turned his head and looked at the table. He had a few glasses of full wine in front of him, but he didn't drink it at all. One of them is a drink.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The world has changed too much..." he whispered in a low voice.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several men came in from the outside and sat down in the neighbors of Kim. These few people were in a happy manner, and after they were seated, they began to talk loudly. This is natural. Aroused the attention of gold.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are they discussing? After listening to it for a few minutes, Kim couldn't help but ask the black cone.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you understand?" "The black cone sticks out of the soup bowl.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The accent is heavy and the speech speed is fast. I really don't understand. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Slave trafficker?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After listening, you know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold looks at the table— - Because of the merits of the black cone, the dishes from these points have been basically eliminated. The crow's belly is like a ball, but still struggling to cope with the last pot of soup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait... this soup..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can drink again tomorrow!" Kim grabbed the neck of the black cone and pinched the table in his hand. The existence of several slave traders made him not want to stay on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waiter waiting for the station immediately took the gold to his room. The room was large, so Kim was like a real tired man, lying on the bed and looking at the ceiling. The waiter used an explicit hint to ask if he needed a beautiful girl to accompany him, but Kim ignored him, so the waiter chose to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold lay still until the waiter closed the door. The alcohol that I just drank into my stomach seemed to play a role, making him feel extremely comfortable lazy. The mind is a bit fuzzy, but Kim does not want to change this relaxed and comfortable feeling. Although he is willing, he can immediately remove the effects of alcohol from his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may be the enjoyment of the black cone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He returned to that trip. Everything on Thursday is full of all kinds of existence. Countless voices in the void directly squeezed into his mind, making him dizzy and painful. He struggled desperately, and these forces struggled with each other and wanted to engulf him. If it was not the heart that always burned the last intellectual fire, he could not leave the space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything there is far stronger than him. But he has one of the greatest advantages: he belongs to chaos, he belongs to the existence without any opposition. No power is limiting him - except his own heart. Every force that wants to engulf him will encounter another force that is equal and opposite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pain is coming back again. Countless melodies are screaming in madness, ubiquitously oppressing his consciousness and forcing him to merge with them. He wants to compromise more than once, wants to give up the fight, and wants to stop the pain. This pain is hard to say, even a living tear bite flesh and blood is just a gentle massage. For example, human criminal laws such as flaming soldering irons and leather whip are not mentioned. All the pain that can cause harm to the flesh will not surpass this pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But giving up your existence and blending with one of those melodies means death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gold! Gold!" An anxious call made him break free of this pain. He opened his eyes and looked at the black cone and slammed his face with his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, you woke up." The black cone saw him open his eyes and sighed. "You just fell asleep."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I? I don't need to sleep anymore..." Kim wants to defend, but the truth seems to be true with the black cone. . So he did not say it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are asleep. I reminded you that your sleep will consume your strength." The black cone licked on the gold nose. Finally. "But I don't seem to remind you not to drink."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The damn wine..." Gold looked up and the window was bright. "How long have I slept?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sleep to the big day." Wu cone replied. "I thought you couldn't wake up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's go, today we're going to find out where the goods are going."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As someone said, a city is wearing two masks at night and during the day. But no one can tell which pair is the inside and which is the watch. The prostitutes on the streets have disappeared completely, just as they never existed. There are no messy stalls on the street, replaced by shops that open for business. These noble shops are full of gorgeous red men and green women. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ordinary strangers dressed like gold, as a ghost is disappointing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“How about going directly to the Chamber of Commerce? I remember that there are usually chambers of commerce to provide or introduce bodyguards. In this case, you may get some clues directly in the Chamber of Commerce.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is also a way." Kim recalled yesterday, and soon found the striking house in the building complex. "Let's go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flow of people on the streets is gradually increasing. At the beginning, it can be considered as a normal phenomenon in time, but soon Kim feels wrong. The flow of people began to get a bit crowded – it seems that for some reason, people all over the city are crowded here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened? So many people?" Kim asked a passerby. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The square in front of the Chamber of Commerce is going to hold a large-scale slave auction." The man replied casually. "A rare and lively thing, although I don't want to buy it, I will go and see it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The word "slave auction?" felt a bit resentful. However, the people around him are not thinking like him. People's faces are full of speed and excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't like the city." Gold whispered to the black cone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It will get used to it slowly." The black cone comforted. "Now you don't know what to do first, this will make you feel a little more comfortable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The square that was still empty yesterday was crowded with people. There were a few temporary wooden stands that were put together, and the wooden platform was carrying out a dirty trade that made Kim feel uncomfortable. The slaves on the stage were forced to face the bidders of the audience - Kim was not even willing to see how their expressions looked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a transaction where one gets everything and the other loses everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is basically no slave trade in the north of the Central Desert. Even the Orcs slowly abandoned this practice. But the desert is difficult, it is coming Said that the slave trade is still quite popular." The black cone turned around and said to himself. “Is this because the area is relatively stable? There is no large-scale war between the wizards. There is no large-scale migration to the plains...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Gold pushes the door of the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Looking for bodyguards and guides?" A young man greeted enthusiastically. "We offer the best."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will ask for some things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Information such as the price of the goods? We have the latest information and only charge a low fee."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not these, I want to know the goods Fall."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cargo?" The Chamber of Commerce was hesitating. "Excuse me, what is the goods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are a number of goods shipped from the north. They were purchased by a southern businessman in Yinye Town. The land is Qianhu City." Jin explained. "Because I heard people say that if they are sent to Thousand Lakes, they will definitely pass the Green Fort. So please come and ask."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But, you know the Chamber of Commerce The rules are that we provide services for a fee. We can help you check the records, but if the person you are looking for has not sought our services, it may disappoint you." The person said with a very polite attitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So please help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please come with me."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man took the gold to a room like a study. Kim heard a loud roar outside the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is that sound?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a few wolves, sir." That job The person answered. "It’s a half-orc sitting wolf. You know, some people just like to hunt, so the adventures like imitating half-orcs riding wolves are quite popular in some places. But these dangerous animals can’t be placed in ordinary places, so we specially give them Custody."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, not only wolves, but even rhinoceros have people try to ride. You see," the man pointed out. “We have nearly a hundred rhinoceros here, all of which are hosted here. We offer a variety of services. If you join our Chamber of Commerce, we can offer you many offers.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Unfortunately, I am not a businessman... let's discuss the business." Jin looked at the rhinoceros far away. "How much does it cost to look through the records?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A gold coin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is extortion!" said the black cone against the golden ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, help me find it. The purpose is Qianhucheng. The goods are crafts and weapons armor made by some dwarves."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man started looking carefully. Kim was squatting in the room. The slave auction outside seems to have reached a climax, and the sound is as high as a wave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Quiet, gold. Some things, even you, can't change." The black cone said to the gold ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Found it!" The staff member shouted. "A man named Seri hired six bodyguards. He exactly matched what you said. The goods came from Silver Leaf Town, the target was Qianhu City, the cargo was dwarf weapon armor, and some fur... The time was one and a half months. Before. He stayed in Green Fort for two days and set off."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good." Gold nodded. “Can I copy one to me?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Of course, please wait.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I'm right, it's a lot better than we expected." When the golden came out, the black cone proudly said. "I said, it is very easy to inquire about this kind of news. Let's go right now? Now using magic will cause unnecessary burden on your body... I don't think it is right when I see you sleeping today. We are still on the move. It’s good to walk for a while.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold did not answer, he was looking up at the slave auction venue in front. A special figure caught his eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A winged girl is being pushed to the high platform by three slave traders. In order to clearly show the slave race, a slave trader deliberately forcibly opened her wings, and the white wings looked very eye-catching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A winged person? It's rare." The black cone was surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s more than just that. Unlike other slaves, this girl was tied up with five flowers, and something was stuffed in her mouth to make her unable to yell. She struggled desperately, but she was unable to fight against three powerful men by her strength. In any case, she was dragged into the high platform. She clearly saw her back from the position of Kim. The girl was wearing a very sloppy and uncoordinated burqa, which was like a piece of cloth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The last one!" The person in charge of the hawking shouted. "It's a winged man! Very rare slave! Want fresh quotes right now!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not the scope of the Winged people's activities...how can there be... ... Wait, Kim, what are you doing, where do you want to go?" The black cone flew into the sky, but Kim still did not answer, just ran to the backyard of the chamber. His movements were very fast, and he jumped over the wall with Superman's strength and skill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A little new excitement for those who see people. "The golden head does not raise the answer. He rushed in all the way, did not encounter any guards - there is really no need to arrange any guards here. He jumped into the wolf cage, and the wolf flinched back to the side, watching him dig into the open space of the rhinoceros from the wolf cage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gold, I said that you are doing a stupid thing." Wu cone sighed. It flew in and out of the sky, but it could not stop Kim’s move. In a few minutes, Kim came out for the rhinoceros. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Twenty... Does anyone have a higher price?" The slave trader shouted with anger. The people in the audience were clearly divided into two batches. One group came to buy slaves. They stood slightly ahead. The other group came to see the excitement. They stood behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rhino! Rhino!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When this call came, everything was too late. Nearly a hundred were shut down for a long time, and the beast that was in desperate need of exercise was like a wave, which caused a ghost to cry. These rhinos were spurred by the noise of the noisy people here, and their heads were red-eyed and there was no head and brain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slave traders jumped off the platform. This kind of thing with wooden planks can't stop the slamming of the hairy rhinoceros. If you are stepped on by the rhinoceros, it will become something that you don't have to understand. When life is at stake, no one cares about slaves and auction prices. The auctioneers ran away after leaving the merchandise. At this time, no matter whether it is the audience or the slave trader, all the people are desperately crowded out of the square. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The winged girl also saw everything. She could have flew to the sky, but the ropes tied her hands, feet and wings. She struggled but could not break free. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't panic!" A voice came from behind her. She struggled to see and saw a stranger came to her. The stranger cut her rope calmly and quickly. "Hurry and leave."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rhinoceros rushed over. The auction desk of the wooden shelves became a piece of paper like a paper paste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, this area extends in all directions. Although there are many people gathered in the square, in the face of the rhinoceros attack, people still have enough passages to escape. Moreover, although the rhinoceros is fierce, the goal is not to concentrate on the crowd, but to have greater hostility to the various curtains hanging on the high platform. Most of the rhinoceros are facing the rags and stepping on the top, not much to chase the crowds running along the street. The accident did not cause serious casualties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, after things have subsided, the cause of all these things has left the city. There will never be someone who can figure out how the rhinos broke out of the cage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You just did a big stupid thing." Wu cone chattered and expressed his opinion. "You can't get anything except causing unnecessary trouble."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's an unnecessary trouble. But even as you said, everything It’s just a game, and I can’t stand it anymore.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Your sense of justice is too strong.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And I really can't think of any trouble this will bring us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said Kim, the consequences of some things are Unpredictable. This is a talk of experience. For example..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For example?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Hey, your troubles are coming."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of the black cone makes Jin stay. He looked up and looked around, but there was nothing left in it, only the weeds blown by the wind were shaking. Here is a big meadow, there is nothing to hide in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My trouble?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, heaven comes."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Heaven?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold looked up to the sky and saw a figure falling sharply. A few white feathers floated in front of his eyes. He immediately recognized the winged girl who was saved by him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl fell in front of the gold and gathered her wings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it to thank you?" Jin Xinzhong thought so. His understanding of the Wings is limited to books and rumors, and the customs of this race are very different according to the tribal division. But no matter where the race is from anywhere in the world, what he does does not seem to be a bad thing. He seems to only get thanks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl came to him, but his face was not smiling, his look was very weird. She walked less than three steps away from Kim and held out a hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Excuse me...What is this?" Kim asked. The girl did not answer. "Can't you understand? Ugly, do you know the dialects of the Wings?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, I will speak lingua franca." The girl suddenly said in a clear and clear voice, almost scared the gold jump. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So..." Jinluo asked a little embarrassed. "Is there anything wrong? If you thank you, you won't need it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want to leave, irresponsible?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Responsible..." This time, even if Kim was calm, he had to express surprise. "Excuse me... What have I done?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you rescued me from the slave traders, did you plan to leave nothing?" The girl was justified – at least in the eyes of gold and black cones – and said. "I have nothing now, no money and no weapons for self-defense. If you leave me alone, I will be caught by the slave traders and beaten by them. Is this the result of your kindness?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That... what should I do?" For the first time, Kim felt that he was poor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give me money. I need money to buy equipment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How much? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ten Gold Coins."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold out ten gold coins and then watch the Wings The girl is flying away. Jin didn't sigh until the figure disappeared completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The black cone, it seems that you are right. Some experiences are still valid."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Oh, don't listen to the Ravens, lose money in front of you. Yes, do you think that girl is somewhat unusual?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you mean? Place?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“temperament. This aggressive tone and way of thinking is really rare...only possible to be born in a noble house.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is indeed possible." Kim walked along with the black cone to discuss the issue. "But why is an aristocratic girl coming from a hometown? This is not the scope of the Wings. If it is a ceremonial ceremonial, she should not fall into the hands of slave traders."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The world's things are not necessarily. Think about yourself, think about me... Under the fucking of fate, the soul is simply unable to extricate itself."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to the words of the black cone, Kim no longer speaks. He walked silently, maybe thinking about the girl, maybe thinking about himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In short, the thing we and the girl should be over. She should be able to take care of herself in the future." Wu cone published his own opinion. "I think you are off course."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"噢?" Jin looked up and looked around. Unconsciously, it has been a long time. They came to a secluded valley path. The trees on both sides of the road are dense and look a bit sinister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems to be the wrong way." Kim judged the direction. "We walked through the valley to see if we made the wrong direction, we will return the same way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, friend, need to guide?" The sharp voice came from the bushes. Then four people came out, one on the other, surrounded by gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All four have weapons. There is no need for any other evidence, and these people are not good enough to see them from their expressions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you, but I don't think I have lost my way." Jin sighed softly. Why do such things always happen again and again? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your journey should be easier. Why not leave your bag? This will save you a lot of burden." This sentence has actually been announced. The identity of these strangers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I advise you to find someone else." Kim replied. "Otherwise you will regret it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unscrupulous tone of the other party’s speech made Kim feel an inexplicable fire. He has made up his mind in mind, and if these guys dare to do it, today is the end of their lives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The reason is yes, but I have no obligation to notify." He replied this way. The four robbers exchanged a look at each other. But they are four to one after all, and this level is still not enough for them to retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, it looks a bit tricky. It’s really rare." The robber standing in front of Kim Jong, a medium-sized guy with a mace , came to Jin. He spit out a little tongue like a beast watching the prey. "Little Master, it seems that we should teach you a little practical skills..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A figure rushed, so fast that it was too late to react. The pike pierced from the robber's cheek and caught the words he hadn't said yet. The attacker quickly retired. Leave the robber holding his face and making a strange cry in pain. A small piece of pink meat was left on the ground, which used to be part of the tongue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything happened so quickly that it was not until the end that people discovered who the raiders were. It was a winged girl with a silver rope armor and a long gun in her hand. The white wings are wide open, and the anger on her face is particularly obvious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s the stinky scorpion!" The big robber who was closest to the girl made a scream and waved the sword in his hand to the girl. The girl flapped her wings while moving backwards. Her movements are much faster than humans, and the robbers simply can't get close to her. The range of attacks that connect to the near sword can't be done. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rifle fired four strokes in a row like a viper, and each hit the hilt accurately. Four fingers fell to the ground, and the long sword could only follow the helpless drop of dust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let you see the interests of the warrior tribe!" The girl made a roar. Her wings flapped with the movements of her feet, and it was like a gust of wind. She rushed to the third robber. The robber hurriedly held up the shield to resist, but the rifle bypassed the useless shield as if it were spiritual, and the gun tip ruthlessly stabbed the clavicle. Along with the twisting of the hands of the gun, a clear fracture sounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth, that is, standing behind the gold, is already running away. Standing at an objective angle is not a good choice, because the wing people fly several times faster than humans. The long gun slammed into the escaper's leg from behind and let the coward fall to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't kill me! Don't kill me!" The man dropped his weapon and turned to beg for mercy. "That's their decision... I didn't do anything!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I remember you, I saw you when I attacked me. I remember Your face, and your ears!" The speed of the pistol was lightning fast, and it was wiped from the head of the robber. The robber felt his ears chill, and he realized that he had lost his right ear forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire battle process takes about a minute. For a little while, the girl defeated four big men. All four have completely lost their fighting power, turning from the beast that had just been hunted to the lamb to be slaughtered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She doesn't seem to be saving you." Wu cone said to Kim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is she and the robbers themselves having a holiday?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It was their first attack Mine." The girl turned her head and looked at Kim. Although the sound of gold and black cones was very light, it was still heard by this girl. "Five days ago, I was attacked by them during the camp. They caught me when I slept, snatched all the things, and sold me as a slave to the slave traders in the city. "The girl said with a grin, it is obvious that this experience is an indesible insult to her. "But they are only equipped to attack people suddenly at night. If you come face to face, I will be more than ten times more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not an exaggeration. The Winged female warriors are really highly skilled. Coupled with the talent's ability to fly, she did have a fight for forty robbers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The robber who was first attacked and lost half of his tongue suddenly rushed to the winged girl. He held his own mace, a mammoth behind the girl's unguarded. The consequences of this sudden attack were tragic: when the pike was pulled out of his mouth, he brought out a few bloody teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter how much psychological preparation of gold, the following scene still makes him feel stunned. The girl forced the robbers to surrender all the valuable things in front of his eyes, and even stripped their clothes - she bundled all the spoils into a bundle and flew away in her hands. Ignore the surprise on the golden face on the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Really not..." This is the only sigh that Kim sent afterwards. The robbers who have left their underwear - only the old genius said they are lucky or unfortunate - although they have suffered different injuries, but they have not lost their ability to act. They rushed into the woods and quickly disappeared from the eyes of Kim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You just said that she is a nobleman?" "In addition to the logic of thinking, there seems to be no common ground in other aspects."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don’t know much about the customs and customs of the Wings. Right, I know One thing: they are very sensitive to the flow of the atmosphere, so what to say is a whisper that is not the ear of the wing. If we move south again, we will probably encounter the Wings, so it is best to remember this." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s very interesting." Kim said softly to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold out of the valley. Their luck was very good, and in front of him was a avenue leading to the south. He just said that it was the wrong way, it was better to say that it was unintentionally wrapped around a short track. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, remember the words just now? The winged girl is here alone, so it will be attacked by robbers... Is there any reason to make a Is the girl alone away from the scope of her ethnic activities and deep into the human area?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't care about this, the worst may be just a war for the war. Scout."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"War of the Wings and Humans?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't matter anyway Our business. Even if there is war, it will not have any significant impact. Although the power of the wizard is a disaster for human beings, at least they can withstand the invasion of foreigners."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Wings do not really pose a real threat to mankind. Although they have launched a large-scale invasion war, they are not territories, but the wealth accumulated by human beings. They are satisfied with the plundering of various treasures." ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't think too much, gold, To understand your main goal "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;". I know ...... "Kim said, he felt a sudden heart of a dynamic. He looked up and saw the pure white wings flying in the sky. Only for a little while, the girl fell in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Return to you!" The winged girl handed him a small purse. Jin opened it and looked at it. There were a bunch of miscellaneous coins - gold, silver, copper and iron - and the total value was about one-fifth of what he gave to the girl. "I sold their things for the money."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems like...there is a little..." Jin smiled. He only felt it at this time, maybe the black cone is telling the truth. This girl is very proud. She was ashamed to say anything even if she thanked her. This situation would have made him feel annoying, but I don't know why, the current gold has no feeling of hate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For other money, let me pay for your bodyguard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This The answer is indeed unexpected. The gold and the black cone are opposite each other, but they don’t know what to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bodyguard, but we don't need bodyguards."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are a traveler "And it is going south." The girl raised her hand, not knowing whether it was intentional or not, her rifle stretched out in front of Kim's face. "You will need a bodyguard to protect yourself. If it wasn't for me, I am afraid that you have been penalized by the robbers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah...that..." The long gun was aimed at the black cone. The crow jumped on the shoulders of Kim and wanted to avoid the threat of the tip of the gun, but the girl seemed to have a heart to aim at it, and the rifle swayed around, always aiming at the crow's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No... I absolutely don't mean this... I am sorry..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This seems interesting. A rather tall man apologized in front of a much weaker winged girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So you just agreed? Ok, my name is Mahia, but others usually call me the night wind." The night wind puts up his own gun, using The unquestionable tone announced the outcome of the negotiations. "What about you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My name is gold...this is the black cone..." Gold answered with a smile. In the face of such a arrogant girl, he seems to have no other choice. But think about it, it might be helpful to bring such a bodyguard on this trip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where are you going?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now plan to go to Thousand Lakes. You are there Do you understand the situation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I passed there not long ago. The situation there is very bad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Oops?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There has been a rebellion against the Wizarding King. Although they can only resist in the form of guerrilla warfare, but rule there. The wizard king seems to have no way to destroy them. So there is chaos and no safety at all. It is your luck to hire me as a bodyguard. Moreover, because the wizard king often carries out the summoning magic experiment, the Warcraft is alive, often Attacking pedestrians."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, this is really not good news..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you still insist on going, we are better off now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gold, I said, you are in trouble, 趁...... "gun swept through, almost put the black cone to hit. The scared black cone flew into the sky and hovered over the top of the gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before speaking, although I am your bodyguard, you are my employer, but I will not accept your insults, especially your pet. The insult!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black cone fell back to Kim’s shoulder, this time he cleverly chose to shut up and could not hear. It’s not wise to whisper in front of the Winged people—especially those that are unfavorable to the winged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go. Right, I see you with a sword, have you learned a little fighting skills?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I learned a little."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sword is very expensive, is it a magic sword?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. You are a warrior of the tribe of the wind...Where is the Zhanfeng tribe located in the southern plateau?" Jin asked. He barely noticed the change in the look of the night wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"is the central zone..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are so deep in the field of humanity what you want to do Is it for reconnaissance?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s just an adventure exercise."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Such a simple reason?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't you believe in a warrior's words?!" The night wind turned to his face and glared at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, no, I believe..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two figures marching along the avenue It quickly disappeared at the end of the horizon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The green dragon flutters from the sky, and it is like a thunder. It stretched its claws and aimed at the prey in the eye. At this speed, even if it is only caught by its poison claws, it is also fatal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the night wind is calm. Her rifle was slanted, and it was only at the last moment of Warcraft's rushing to the side. The wings of Warcraft slid across her wings, bringing a white feather to fly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's really good, one person can deal with a flying dragon." The black cone spoke on the shoulder of Kim. "She must have received excellent training."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no victory. The dragon is a very strong creature. And they are quite awkward, I guess it will be used right away. The force of the wind came to attack." Jin replied. With the night wind in the sky, the two of them are no longer the target of the dragon - at least they are not the target before they kill the wing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gold, according to the information we have now, this has brought a whole month of heavy rain, which will certainly block the advance of the caravan. If so, Will those merchants choose another safe way?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The green dragon has stopped the momentum. The night wind has just smashed it, letting it scream out anger and pain. But this is not enough to defeat it, nor is it enough to give up the plan to treat these travelers as dinner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold is right. This huge Warcraft is a great threat to pedestrians. It is rare for ordinary people to escape from their claws. They did not leave the avenue, but they encountered such a giant World of Warcraft, it can be seen that this World of Warcraft activity has been extremely embarrassing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon is once again approaching the night wind. This time it slowly approached. The night wind also clenched the long gun, keeping an eye on Warcraft's every move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be careful of the power of the wind it controls!" Kim shouted. Because the night wind does not move, this is very easy to be hit by the power of Warcraft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it’s too late, the power of Warcraft has already been issued. Two energy hit the wings of the winged man. The night wind did not expect this sudden attack, her body lost balance and fell from the sky. The dragon rushed down and once again pointed the claws at the head and chest of the prey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn!" Kim looked at this scene. He wanted to use a magic, but the black cone is a step faster than him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will help her!" The crow rushed through the sky like a black feather arrow, rushing to one of its eyes before Warcraft succeeded. Use your own cockroaches on the huge eyes. The dragon's momentum was distorted, and this time it was just rubbing the night wind and failed to hit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let you see the power of my black cone!" The crow flew around the dragon's head and repeatedly attacked sensitive eyes. Its attack is actually very weak, and it can't even cause any harm. The dragon has to put all the spirits on the crow temporarily. It wants to blow the crow with the wind fanned by the wings, but it has no effect. It wants to attack with the force of the wind, but it can't hit a small, mobile and flexible target. In the end, it only chooses to escape, but the crow is tightly entangled and does not let go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rifle made a fierce and fatal blow. Piercing from underneath Warcraft, a shot through the throat and blood vessels. Blood springs come out. World of Warcraft screamed and fell, violently hit the earth. The dragon's wings are weak and curled up, representing that its life has fallen into the arms of Pluto. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Call...call...something..." The night wind slowly landed from the sky, and the heart looked at the huge body of the dragon. If the attack of Warcraft just succeeded, then she was now digested in the stomach of the dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Night wind, don't you know that the dragon can control the power of the wind?" Jin went forward and asked. "Stop in the air and it is dangerous to confront."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course I know!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Then why did you just..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just looked for the flaws of it. Just like that." The night wind forced a sly hair, A conclusion is made about his own behavior. "Let's go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She really knows?" Looking at the bodyguard a few steps, Kim asked some hesitant back to his shoulder. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know if she knows. If I know, there is no need to bother me to use the Umbrella Master..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rifle stabbed like a lightning, passing over the crow. A black tail feather floated to the ground - the black cone was swallowed and hard to swallow it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Believe... Believe..." The black cone flapped its wings and wanted to fly, but it was not overnight. The rifle advanced a little bit, just touching the black feather on the neck of the crow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Apologize!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I apologize, I apologize, I express my sincere apology, I shouldn't..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remember, I am a warrior, I will not accept insults!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, yes..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wings lived In the southern plateau, it has been independent of most races since ancient times. They are divided into many tribes according to blood and customs, scattered over the vast plateau. In general, if outsiders respect their customs, they are welcome guests. I like freedom, and I have never been able to unite into one country. Because of this, their threat to humanity..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not endorse, gold." Broke the reciting of gold to himself. "The things in the book know well, there is no need to repeat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I am just wondering why there are no obvious features of the Wings in the book." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you mean violent character?" The black cone looked at his tail and asked. It originally had twelve tail feathers, and there are still ten left. It is these two lost feathers that teach the crows not to whisper casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't think half-orcs are so rude. Especially as women..." Kim exclaimed. The black cone suddenly jumped over the head of Kim and slammed his nose hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What, u-cone!... To be honest, I really doubt her gender. Women should not be so violent and aggressive..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What gender do you suspect?!" A sudden voice came from behind. Kim rolled over and saw that his bodyguard didn't know when he had come to his rear. In the hands of the night wind, she held a long gun that she never left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, you got it wrong."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'm wrong...you human total Is it like to say bad things about others in the back?" The night wind looked at the black cone and gold with a very fierce expression. "I ask you to apologize to me immediately!" Her rifle stretched out halfway and shot the threatening reflection into the gold. In the eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's apologize. You have to take responsibility for the bodyguard you hired!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I apologize, I know it is wrong." Jin looked helplessly at the black cone and replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I brought the news you wanted." The night wind proudly licked her hair, and her apology for Kim was not very concerned. As long as Kim apologizes, she is satisfied. “I went to a dozen villages nearby. Some of them saw that the team passed the avenue three or four days ago. But the specific direction is unknown, maybe it is Qianhucheng.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "No." Kim began to think carefully about this issue. "The caravan was delayed for two months because of heavy rain and disease. And they must know the news of Qianhucheng. A smart businessman will never choose a turbulent area. I believe they must Has changed direction. What do you think, the black cone?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't eat too much. But they shouldn't be able to go back from the same path - the merchant would rather take risks They are not willing to eclipse. They either choose to continue to Qianhucheng or intend to detour. I think we need to go to Qianhucheng to find out the news."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, it seems that I am really fate." Kim sighed and looked at the female soldier standing on the side. "Night wind, don't sit down and take a break? Maybe you will have to hurry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am a strictly trained fighter, and you ordinary people Different." The night wind said in a proud tone. "I can't feel tired at this level."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So who said last night that night fell asleep in the middle of the night?" The black cone could not help but open refute. This consequence is catastrophic. The night wind flew up and caught it before the black cone fled and fled into the bush where the winged man could not fly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't always take chances." She let go and the frightened crow quickly fled to a safe place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wu cone!" Jin walked over, his face was actually a bad laugh. "I thought that your two tail feathers had already taught you to think twice before you talk."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black cone rushed into the gold and slammed into his face. Then I started to have no troubles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's go," said the night wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold broke away from the black cone and caught the crow in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The journey of this time has given Kim a relatively direct understanding of the Wings. In fact, the Wings do not always fly in the sky, because flying is also a very laborious thing for them. Most of the time, the Wings and the humans chose to walk with their feet. But if you really need it, the winged person's wings plus his feet are a few times faster than ordinary humans. If it is purely capable of flying, the winged people do not have birds flying fast. At least as long as it is not unexpected, the night wind is unable to catch up with the black cone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Otherwise the cone does not have ten tail feathers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The identity of this winged girl who claims to be a night wind is quite suspicious. Although she said that the relationship with Kim is the employer and bodyguard - this is her self-proclaimed - but if she really can protect the employer is really a problem. It is true that she has a good war, but she seems to lack a reassuring power. Although she said that she is a warrior, her experience is lacking and her vigilance is not high. The inside of the winged people is not very peaceful, the bloody conflicts between the tribes continue, and even long-term feuds. The title of a warrior in this environment may not be a display. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I really want to ask her identity." Kim whispered to the black cone. The night wind is in front of it, and it is impossible to hear his voice anyway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to ask, but I have to wait for my new tail feathers to grow up." The black cone gave him a look and replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After six days of advancement and search, Kim is still approaching Qianhucheng. They all inquired about the business travels to everyone, but the results were either not known or passed three or five days earlier than them. The night wind suggested more than one time to speed up, but Kim did not choose to do so. He is concerned that those businessmen may not be able to withstand the risks and suddenly turn around. In this case, he may have passed the business people. In any case, the six days of inquiries and reconnaissance showed that they were slightly faster than the caravan. The last time they inquired, the number of days between them had shrunk into two days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this continues, they can catch up with that caravan in ten days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are only one day away from Qianhucheng." The black cone fell from the sky and told Jin that it had seen the city. "But in front of the mountains, I don't see if there is a business travel team."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The city surrounded by mountains... Why is it called Qianhucheng?" Kim asked a little surprised. He originally thought that the city named this name should be above the plains, spread over rivers and lakes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You haven't heard of it?" The night wind looked at him with amazement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know anything about the city except the name." Jin smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This city was originally a large lake surrounded by mountains." The night wind said. “The sorcerer King Hoofley took a fancy to this land and decided to build his own city here. So he gathered countless human and material resources and filled out a piece of land in the lake in five years. The original lake was divided into several Hundreds of small lakes, so it is called Qianhu City."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's crazy, boring to this... wasting the people." Carefully comb your tail feathers with your mouth and give your opinion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It was. But because he is a wizard king, there is no other choice. The price of resistance is destruction." The night wind sighed. "What can the Witchmaster want to do, isn't it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why don't those people leave here? Leaving the Wizard King alone is not very good. ?? Kim suddenly asked the black cone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to the black cone is straightforward, so Kim no longer speaks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s Hoffley II who is now in the area of ​​Thousand Lakes. He is more brutal and brutal than his father. I heard that he often conducts evil magic experiments." The night wind said. "He is now doing everything possible to annihilate the resistance. So you should be careful, you are likely to be executed immediately as a rebel - just because you are a stranger."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Do you know the situation of those rebel forces?" Jin asked the night wind. "Be able to fight against the wizard king, then they should have some tricks against the wizard king."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know this. I only heard that they are hidden in this film. In the middle of the mountains, the ghosts of the wizarding kings and the supply team were attacked by ghosts. But sooner or later they will be suppressed by the wizard king because they have no power against the wizard king."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;They marched along the mountain avenue. This road was very well-repaired – it also shows how much manpower was spent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gold, is it strange?" After a while, the black cone suddenly asked. "It seems that there are no signs of activity in the vicinity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a bit strange. The closer you are to the city, the denser the population. Moreover, this belt is already under the control of Qianhu City. There is a lot less trouble in Warcraft, but people are not much. In fact, in those areas where World of Warcraft is awkward, you can meet pedestrians or villages, but this area can't be seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Somewhat wrong." Kim also began to feel a little weird. The night wind flew into the sky, but soon returned to the ground, she brought a message. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a big village in front." The night wind said. “It’s very close, you can get it in an hour.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Inquire about our goals, if possible, spend the night in the village today. In the evening, enter Qianhucheng It doesn't seem to be appropriate." Wu cone suggested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night wind is right, this is indeed a big village. There are hundreds of thousands of people in the village. The only thing that is not right is the atmosphere in the village. The villagers saw that the two strangers (one of them were still winged) did not stop when they came in, but stood far away and observed the visitors with suspicion. Kim’s attitude when he went to inquire about the news was very cold. Only a villager who opened a small shop told him after he bought something. The caravan he had inquired passed two days ago but did not stay in the village. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened in the village?" Kim finally asked the owner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man hesitated for a long time, perhaps the conversation just gave him a good impression, and he finally said it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We were notified that within ten days we must leave here and go to the city of Thousand Lakes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Why."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because the wizard King Hoofley II wanted to destroy the rebels in this way. He believed that all the villages outside the city were Support the Rebels. So it should disappear completely."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah!" Kim finally understood. At this sensitive moment, foreign strangers are easily misunderstood as spy spies of the wizard king, and naturally will receive this treatment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you." He walked out of the store. The night wind is waiting for him outside the store. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have heard the news. Our goal is probably already in Qianhucheng." Jin said something. "We stayed here for one night and entered the city tomorrow. We are probably the last guests to be remembered."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The last batch of guests?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yeah, because the village will disappear in a few days... The wizard king ordered all the people in the nearby village to enter the city, otherwise they would be the rebel army. Destroy it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...It’s pathetic.” The night wind is a rare expression of sympathy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be pitiful. At least they can still live." The black cone patted his wings. "I hope you can use your compassion to me." Poor tail feathers above."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, no, when I didn't say anything... I didn't say anything..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black cone flew into the sky. Fortunately, the night wind does not seem to be pursued. Its tail feathers are no longer needed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This hotel is really good," Jin entered the hotel in the village, could not help but sigh. This is a very beautiful house, clean and beautiful, tall and spacious. The decor is beautiful but not vulgar. In short, the hotel is absolutely excellent at the level of a country hotel. This is undoubtedly the biggest property of the hotel owner - although the property is about to be lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hotel is cold and clear - this is normal. A tall, sturdy, but full-faced middle-aged woman received the guests at the counter. As Kim said, they should be the last guests of this poor hotel. Gold is only a one night stay, plus a breakfast for tomorrow. The hostess mixed her promises and took a few rooms with her fingers to let the gold go in. This is obviously not the usual hospitality of this hotel - seeing it, the hostess has been crushed by this blow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Poor." When the gold came to the hotel hostess to point to his room, the black cone could not help but express his opinion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes." Gold replied casually. Suddenly he suddenly found his voice so cold, and he could not believe himself. Although he is also expressing his own pity, his voice is no different from the black cone. This discovery made him slammed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I... Should I do something?" Kim struggled hard and struggled with his heart. He pushed the door, but the door did not move. Obviously, the shaft of this door lacked lubrication. So he added a hand to his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh. She has decided to succumb to fate, what do you want?" Wu cone ruthlessly pointed out the essence of the matter. "You have already realized that after seeing too much sorrow, the human heart will become as cold as a stone - even if you are, you can't control all the unfair things in the world."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I admit...but..." Kim wants to refute, but can't speak. The door was pushed open and a thing slammed through the room in the black. The flash of his physical instinct flashed through this sudden attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who..." Kim had not had time to speak, and the second came again. This time, the flying stuff has a large head and a very solid head of the middle gold. Let him flash a few stars in his eyes, and the sound of broken porcelain came from his ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah..." The blonde screamed, and before he realized it, his hand had pulled out the sword and rushed into the room. The third thing flew, and Kim’s hand waved, and the thing was immediately divided into two halves, turning into a sky full of cotton wool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't come over..." He heard a woman's voice. The curtains in the room were pulled and the light was very dim. On the bedside, a figure was scared and shrunk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, what are you doing, gold?" The black cone flew in time to the golden eye. Kim has calmed down and there are no other people in the room. The weapon that attacked him just now, the first one is a mirror, the second is a vase, and the third is a pillow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wrong room..." Kim suddenly understood what he was doing. There is no doubt that he must have gone to the wrong room - or the hotel hostess pointed to the wrong room. And there was a female traveler in this room - it was not surprising that the room forcibly breaking into a girl was treated like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry about..." He took the sword and apologized in a very awkward voice. He turned his head and tried to go out, but he saw that the hostess was standing at the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are going wrong!" She looked anxious. Pulled the gold out and closed the door. Kim noticed that the lock on this door was special - the hotel room should be outside the lock, but the door is locked inside - this is why he was particularly troublesome when he opened the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong?" The night wind poked his head out of another room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing." The hostess of the hotel showed a smile that was hard out. "Broken the vase."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You come to this room." She took the gold to another room. "Don't go in that place."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My daughter, unfortunately got a strange disease." The hostess of the hotel said that he was arrogant. "So I kept her inside."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Strange disease? What disease?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "In short, it is a strange disease." The hostess obviously did not want to explain it. "Guest, you live in this room. Just don't go there." She turned and left, leaving the gold doubt standing in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's so interesting! A daughter who has a strange illness..." The black cone flapped its wings and said with a smile. "But I really can't see the similarities between the girl and the female shopkeeper."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You just saw, the black cone? There is very light there. Dark."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s very clear to see. And the daughter who had a strange illness actually had a relationship with us.”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The edge of one side?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remember, the therapist we met ten days ago The one who sang a song for you, you gave her a few gold coins."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Xu Na?" Jin thought about it, after all, he was right The girl’s impression is deep. But he did not expect to see a therapist who had "a strange disease" here. Under the blessing of the goddess, the therapists have little to do with the disease. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't look like she is a therapist, otherwise she won't have any problems."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you doubting my ability to judge?" The black cone was knocked on the golden head. "She promised not to have got a strange disease." I saw it very clearly. Her look and face were very normal, and she didn't have any epidemic at all. And she was very scared - even if a stranger pushed in the door. She shouldn't be so scared. And she doesn't look like that woman. If they are both mother and daughter, you simply say that I am a good family with the night wind. There is absolutely no reason."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So are you going to tell me that the people in this village have locked her up and ready to burn?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I am planning to make such a guess. But there is another possibility, she may be a sacrifice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sacrifice???"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You think, the most annoying thing for the wizard is the therapist. They often use heavy money to reward the therapist. If the people in this village find that she is a therapist, then they are likely Use her to make a deal with the wizard king: let the wizard king believe that they are loyal, not resisting Supporters so the village people can stay at home, not to be forcibly relocated. "Black cone of undetermined significance issued laughter. "It's a good deal, isn't it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So important people are in the hotel? Let a hostess guard... and the guards are not Seriously got it, the black cone." Jin put a hand. "Although the wizard king is rewarding a lot of money, there are still very few people who are willing to sell the therapist. But this thing does attract my curiosity. If she and the boss are not mothers and daughters, why should she be locked up?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I also find it very curious. Why don't we go and have a look?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold whispered out door. As he said, the guards are really not serious. The hotel hostess went out. There was no one in the corridor, only their slight footsteps and breathing broke the silence in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold went to the door of the room. He whispered three times on the door before pushing the door open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time nothing flies out. In the dark light of the room, he could barely see the girl sitting in front of the bed. The sky was dark, and with the dense curtains, I couldn’t see the girl’s expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Xu Na?" He screamed. The girl immediately reacted, and her body moved and slowly stood up from the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who?" Her voice was a little trembling. That is the fear that has gone deep into the bone marrow. "You..." Just as others can't see her, she can't see the appearance of the coming door. But she can see that the other person is a tall man, and carries a weapon. More importantly, the other person actually knows her name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it you?" Xi Na suddenly remembered the identity of the coming person. In fact, a good-hearted person who can get two gold coins at a time is really impressive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong?" Another voice came. A figure with wings appeared behind Kim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Night Wind? You... How come you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I originally wanted to rest But if I hear bad things, I have to get up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it bad?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "A crow actually said that he and I are the same family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wu cones want to escape, but it is too late. One hand caught it before it could take off. The night wind grabbed the neck of the black cone, grabbed it in the hand, and began to sway the crow like a bottle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You..." Xina came to the door. At this distance, she can clearly see that both of them have weapons. This gave her a glimmer of hope. "Is it a mercenary?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mercenary? Do I look like this?" Kim has seen the girl's pale face. Xi Na looks nervous and full of all kinds of intertwined emotions. She is too young to know how to control herself - no doubt she needs help now and needs help very much. "If you think we are very similar, then when we are mercenaries, do you want to hire us?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night wind releases the black cone, dizziness The rising crow flew back to Kim’s shoulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Help me!" Suddenly, the girl caught gold like a savior. "They want to burn Miss Moonless, it will be this evening."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Burn the death? Why?" The night wind was amazed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They said Miss Wu is a wizard! They want to burn her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Witcher ? Will she be magic?" Kim asked with some hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But she didn't do anything bad, didn't do anything..." The girl began to weep. "She just wanted to help them, but they caught her." Get up, and burn her to death..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What to do, the black cone?" Kim used a look to suggest the crow on his shoulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Very interesting, another magician. Let's go see!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is this time It is completely dark. Tonight, the clouds are densely covered, there is no moonlight or starlight, and the faint night sky seems to be a sign of some ominous signs. The entrance to the hotel is a little better, with lighting and a black lacquer on the outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where?" Gold whispered Qiao Na. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There... I don't see it clearly..." The girl whispered. Before Jinjin Village did not observe the distribution of the village buildings, Xi Na did not much better. She is not familiar with the village, and the darkness of the night has caused a lot of trouble for her job search. She could not find a house that was not in the moon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have almost wandered around the village. Although the darkness of the night caused trouble for the identification work of Xi Na, it also obscured them. They turned this circle without causing any unexpected troubles - this group rarely has dogs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where is it?" The night wind is a little annoying. The winged people's night vision ability is not strong, and this road has already polished her patience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait a minute, look over there!" The black cone screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a fire in the distance. One point, two points, three points, and seventeen or eight points, it is obviously a group of people holding torches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oops..." Gold whispered. He had intended to secretly rescue the magician (should be a magician) from the imprisoned place, but it seems that the plan went bankrupt. "We are in the past."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't call, otherwise we have to go up with her." The night wind said to Xi Na's ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation looks really bad. On the open space in the middle of the village, a huge woodpile was erected, and a man was tied to the pillar in the middle of the woodpile. Hundreds of villagers were surrounded by firearms, some were cursing in high voices, and others were silent. Everyone’s attention was focused on the firearms, and no one noticed that a few strangers appeared on the periphery of the crowd. The night wind dragged Xina to hide far away because they are easily recognizable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one who was tied to the pillar of fire was a tall woman. She lowered her head and hangs her black hair in a mess, so that Kim can't see her face clearly. It was clear that her mouth was stuffed into something that prevented her from speaking. I don't know if it was a coma. She didn't respond to the insults of the crowd and the small stones that she had thrown away. So she kept her head down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"burning this witch!" someone shouted so loudly. Everyone is filled with indignation - they vent their anger against the wizard king to this woman. Many people hold torches in their hands, but no one has thrown the torches on the woodpile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The weird elf pulsing..." The black cone looked at the woman on the firearm and said to herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What to do... Miss Moonless Girl..." Xina grabbed the hand of the night wind and said anxiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No hope." The black cone flew over and said in a very vicious tone. "There are too many people. Say goodbye to her here, see how she was burned to death... Ah..." Looking at the liquid from the girl's eyes, the crow suddenly panicked. It was only intended to make a joke. "Don't cry, don't cry... Don't worry, Kim has a way. Don't worry... Oh, don't cry! Ah..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nightly I punched it on the head of the black cone and hit it to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When are you, let's make this joke!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's really troublesome." Kim reached out and pulled out his sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait a minute, do you want to fight so many villagers?" The night wind shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." Gold whispered. He was empty, "Dark!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd suddenly quieted down. People are looking around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who broke the fire?" Someone shouted. "I can't see it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, the fire is gone!" Some people with torches shouted. Although their eyes are invisible, the body still feels the burning of the flame. "It's magic!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's a wizard!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This shout caused deadly confusion. The villagers who just gathered together and wanted to imprison the witch began to wander around. The power of magic made them temporarily lose their sight, and the shouts that provoked them made their hearings lose their effect. The chaos of the whole scene can be described by pen and ink. People collide with each other, the torches are littered, and the crying of women and the curse of men are intertwined into a song of chaos. Under this circumstance, no one would know that several people rushed to the firearms, put the people who were originally prepared to be sentenced down, and then disappeared quietly and unobtrusively at the entrance of the village. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s too close to the village, they won’t chase it?” The cone looked around and whispered a question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are now on the edge of a small valley that is not far from the village. No moon has woke up from a coma, but it is still very weak. She may have been tortured by the villagers and covered with various scars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't think they will," Kim replied. He began to consider his own choice. Xi Na and the night wind are taking care of no moon, and he is standing at the crossroads alert, the black cone is with him. "They will think that the magic just used is moonless. They won't have the courage to chase a wizard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Witcher...Speaking of this, Kim, Have you noticed the strange genius pulsation on the moon? It is not like a magician... but more like a..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black cone turned his head. It saw that Xi Na was not around the moon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The little therapist doesn't seem to be technically good, and the skin trauma has not been cured yet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold did not answer. He walked a short distance forward. This kind of night people's vision is very limited. If you want to catch up with others, you must wear a torch or the like. However, this kind of thing did not appear. It seems that the villagers have given up. Having said that, this is a mountain jungle nearby, without the aid of magic, it is really difficult to search for a few people at night. Giving up is correct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It looks like there won't be a chase, let's go back," he said to the black cone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good." The black cone patted the wings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold returns to other people. The woman named No Moon has recovered a lot. She sits on the haystack and looks at the man who saved her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is Mr. Jin, he saved you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, Kim Sir." No moon looked up at this strange man, his voice was very calm. She carefully looked at the other side and finally looked at the golden sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The rare ancient magic sword," she said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for complimenting." Kim is also looking at no moon. It was dark, but it didn't affect him much. This woman, who is called no moon, looks a little bigger than her, and her pale face reveals the calmness and maturity that Xina lacks. No, her face can't be said to be pale, but it is completely bloodless. And not only the face, all the skin exposed outside the clothes is almost the same as her face. Exaggeratedly, she is more like a living person than a corpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this may also be due to the twists and turns just now. Maybe it is related to the treatment of Xi Na. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In short, thank you very much for saving me." No moon stood up and thanked you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, Miss Moon... Mr. King just... just used magic...he..." Xia said with a sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know. But that is not his magic, the magic of his sword. The sword is an ancient magic sword, the sword itself can cast magic." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It turns out that I thought Mr. King is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good! "The night wind that has never been heard has also stood up. She spread her hands. "In short, it is impossible to rest well tonight. We are still walking the night road, and we will enter Qianhu City tomorrow morning. Hey, I could have been comfortable lying on the hotel bed..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who is it supposed to rest here?" The black cone couldn't help but shouted again. This time it moved very fast and flew into the sky before the night wind rushed over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's because I can't see clearly at night!" The night wind screamed and replied. "Our wingers have a bad night vision! You crow, wait, the next time you must pull the hair off your tail!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Uh..." There was no moon on one side and I couldn’t help but laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't make sense to continue to stay here. It's better to go to the night road. It's better to enter Qianhu City tomorrow morning. Miss Moon, there is a problem with walking." "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can call me without a month." No moon smiled and replied. "I think there is no problem. With the help of Xi Na, the minor injury is already good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, let's go, gold." The shoulders, it pays careful attention to the night wind. Although the night wind is full of enthusiasm, it is not intended to fulfill her promise. She held a rifle and walked in the last position of the team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this winged lady?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is called Mahiah, it is mine..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh." No moon smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As previously stated, the road to Thousand Lakes is very flat on the one hand, and the pedestrians on the other hand are very small (because many villages have been forcibly removed) )). They did not encounter any obstacles along the way. When the east reveals a white belly, Qianhu City is already far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This journey is finally over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt, no matter whether the team he is looking for sells goods in Thousand Lakes, they will stay in the city for a short time - inquire about the news The item takes two or three days. He must be able to find the group of merchants in the city, and then he can get back what he originally belonged to. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Everyone, wait a minute?" A voice interrupted Kim’s ideas. A woman slowly walked out of the woods with her voice, blocking her way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Excuse me...Do we know?" Jin asked. The woman has empty hands and wears a very rare leopard skin safari. She smiles and is not like a pleasant person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are meeting for the first time." The woman laughed. "But I know the lady." Her hand pointed to the moon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But... I don't know you..." No moon looked at this sudden pop-up, hesitantly replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know you enough, and I know that you are a wizard." The strange woman laughed. "And I... the most hateful thing is The wizard!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the last word, she sends a password. The people who had been hidden all around came out, and nearly fifty of them were squatting, aiming at the four people and one bird. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Strange, I can't even feel it at all..." The black cone looked at the ambush with some surprise. These people have different costumes, but the movements are very uniform. They have magic crosses in their hands<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't think about magic. As long as your lips move, I will shoot you all into a horse!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you guys...rebel?" Kim suddenly thought of a problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's right!" The woman covered her mouth and laughed. "So, you guys and wizards are better not to act rashly..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, who are you walking dogs?!" A long gun in his hand. But at least ten crosses were aimed at her, making her unable to act. Even the winged people who are known for their quickness and quickness, there is no chance in the case of so many weapons aiming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You protect a witch master, isn't it her running dog? Right, introduce yourself, others call me ice blue, I am against Hoofe The leader of the uprising army ruled by Lee II."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But she is not a wizard." Kim patiently explained. "If she is a wizard, why bother to Thousand Lakes City? To seize the rule of power? But she has not established a grievance tower..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Whether it is a wizard It’s not that you have the final say.” Ice blue waved. "I judge that she is a wizard, she is a wizard! My eyes can see what you can't see... Do you want to deny my accusation?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, this kind of crime can not be put on a person's head!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, let's fight. Our custom, if there is not enough evidence, then judge with a duel. The gods will naturally judge the correct one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, hello," Some turned white. "Do you mean it?" It groaned. "This custom is really stupid."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am interested, then I accept this duel." Kim's hand slowly pulled out his sword. "If I win, you and your people will leave."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The first thing you have to win is." Ice blue with an extremely confident smile Come face the gold. "Is you coming to fight with me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course. Look down on women? I will remind you first, I am very powerful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait for gold, why do you agree to this stupid request... ..." The black cone was attached to the golden ear and said quickly. "You can..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't matter, the black cone. Do you think I will lose?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Not what it means... I mean... forget it, whatever you want!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a minute, Kim, I am coming..." The wind shouted behind, but Kim immediately refused. "No, let me give it this time, night wind. After all, this decision was made by me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let this accident end soon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold came forward. The people who surrounded them spread a little and made room for enough space. But there are still enough weapons aimed at other people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Miss Sorcerer, our cockroaches can sense the fluctuations of magic." Ice blue loudly warned. "If you want to take advantage of the magic, you will immediately have more than a dozen holes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No moon tightly biting the white lips, But did not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Kim," Xina shouted. "Please be careful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will." Kim confidently stroked the magic sword in his hand and whispered, "Just let her not move... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a minute, gold." The black cone that had just flown into the sky flew back to the shoulder of Kim. "I forgot to remind you that you have used up the magic of the sword in the middle of the night. I am afraid you have to use the real time to compete with the woman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Real Kung Fu..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So I started!" Ice blue shouted. Her hand swayed and a sword appeared on her hand. It was a slender sword, and even a slender, excessive sword. The blade is longer than the normal sword, but it seems to be a broken one. The action of ice blue is almost the same as the afterimage. For a moment, even before Kim had enough reaction time, Ice Blue had already rushed to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Little fool, you can have more than one ancient magic sword."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the move, the fine sword swiftly slammed down, leaving a blue mark in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How could this be a weapon..." Jin was shocked, but it was already late. His body instinctively resisted the sword and the two swords slammed together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air is full of arc-sweeping ziz, the flesh and blood burns and gives off a pungent smell. The whole body of gold is stiff, and the fine sword that causes all the damage is attached to his sword. The energy of the thunder and lightning came out from the fine sword, and the pulsating rush of the golden body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wu cone...why don't you tell me earlier..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wu cone in the sky Turning around, innocent answer. "You never asked me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah..." The blonde snorted. His body can withstand the sharp edge, but can not withstand the constant impact of such lightning. Such a powerful electric shock made his body feel completely paralyzed. The entire body loses its ability to move, except that the mind can remain awake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sure enough, the resistance is very strong. No wonder the wizard will find you as a man..." Ice blue faces gold, revealing a cruel smile. "But this is not the strongest power of my sword. Come on, taste the true power of my ancient magic sword!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呜..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, Mr. Jin!" Yuna gave a scream. The ice-blue sword suddenly swelled, and the blue electric light wrapped the entire blade, and all the gold body was swept in. When the light disappeared, Xi Na saw gold and then slowly fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It will only be a big talk." The winner took up the weapon and looked at the body that would not move under his feet. “People who like to talk big are generally dead faster.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is still alive... What kind of vitality is this... forget it, bring him back together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. King! Mr. King!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold slowly opened his eyes and saw the eyes of Xi Na. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You wake up...it's really great..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am Say you don't have to worry so much. This guy's vitality can be compared with lizards... then the degree of electric shock is not killing him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;金Turned around and saw the proud black cone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I said the black cone, can't you change a more appropriate analogy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kim climbed up and began to look around. They are now in a dark stone house. There is a small window on the roof, and the angle of sunlight that is thrown in indicates that it is near noon. Everyone, including the black cone, was put in this little black room. The Rebels apparently searched them very carefully, including the triangular sharps on the gold belt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no moon sitting quietly in the corner of the wall, looking at the impenetrable door in front. She has a pair of handcuffs on her hand, which is her only unique treatment. Her face looked paler in the dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have said it, it should be meseded by me!" The night wind looked at gold. "If that's the case, we won't have to be caught here. Why am I being insulted as a warrior?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't necessarily have to play And if you lose, you will be killed." The black cone shot his wings. "You also see the speed of the woman named Ice Blue. You have to use your feet and wings to level off with her speed. As long as her sword touches you, even use only the rifle that touches you. "You are finished."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night wind snorted and twisted his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just tried to treat Mr. Jin... but Mr. Jin’s body seems to have not suffered any harm...” Xi Na looked Kim, "I just saw that Mr. Jin was so hurt..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah...this is for a reason, anyway, we First, I have to leave." Jin quickly shifted the topic. "Without the moon, can you break the wall here with magic?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah..." Nothing happens when the moon hears the call. She had just stared at the door and didn't know what to think. "Sorry, I can't do anything now." She raised her hand and gestured to others about the embarrassment in her hand. "I can't use magic now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Falun?" The black cone finally recognized this thing. It is no wonder that the Rebels dared to be so reassured by wearing this thing for her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes." No moon reluctantly smiled. "When you put on this thing, no one can use any magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that I still need to do it." Jin smiled a bit. "Wu cone, do you think my luck is very bad?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is not very good. We still want to get out of here as soon as possible, dark I don't like it here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you want to leave?" said the night wind disdainfully. "If we can just leave, they won't shut us up here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is always a way." The cone flies to the night wind before. "I am a black-faced uncle, there is nothing in the world that I can't do." He raised his wings. "Although it is also a pair of wings, but I am much better than some people." It proudly announced that the night wind caught, but was flashed by the black cone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You stupid crow, okay, let me see what you have!" The night wind stares at the black cone, "If you don't Go, I will take you to burn the crow soup!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, do you really burn soup? I don't think you even cook a water!" The black cone laughed and flew up the beam. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!" The door was pushed open, and several people came in. The leader was ice blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you decide to dispose of us?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, your injury has Was cured by this therapist?” Ice Blue glanced at the gold and looked at Xi Na. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to do with us?" No moon looked up at people. Kim noticed a very strange thing - the tone of the moonless expression was too calm. This can only explain two things, or there is no moon to hold, no fear of rebellion, or she does not care about life and death. The latter is almost impossible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Disposal? It's still too early. We need to have a meeting to decide on your disposal. You are all coming out!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So is it decided to deal with us?" The night wind asked with disdain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will know when I come out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captives stood up, except for no moon, Everyone else was taken out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The place where they are now should be the Rebel’s nest. Here is a quiet valley. Although the location is not clear, according to the time projection, the distance from Qianhu City will not exceed one day. And a wizard king can't really detect the rebel army that is less than one day away from the city. It is really ridiculous. You know, the wizarding magic of the wizard king can cover almost all of his territory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But everything they see is even more surprising. Is this really an organized rebel? In the creek in the valley, women are washing clothes, children are playing in flat places, and in a small mill in the distance, men can see the figure of grinding wheat. Further afield, the woodcutter is cutting down trees. If it weren't for the ice blue around her and her armed men, Jin Ning could believe that he came to a small village. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You...is it really a rebel against the Witch King?" Kim asked incredulously. Indeed, some of the family members, especially the spontaneous volunteers, are not strange, but here... is it too much? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't believe it?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I feel like an ordinary mountain village." The black cone is on the shoulders of Kim's shoulders. What I saw in front of me was nothing to do with "the gods who attacked the wizard king and the rebel army that made the wizard king very troublesome." A rough estimate of gold, there are about five or six hundred people here, of which no more than one hundred young men. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Here is the base of a rebel family of the Rebels?" This is the only reasonable inference. Concentrate the old and the weak women and children into one base, so that the main force can be unconcerned...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, the so-called rebel army, all here. "." Ice blue sneered with a low head. "And we are not an army. If it weren't for the cruel thing that the wizard king did, we would probably endure it silently."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, What do you want us to do out?" The night wind is obviously unbearable, and she doesn't care about these things. The Witch King and the Rebels are human beings and have nothing to do with the Wings. "And why do you tie my wings?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you swear not to escape, I can unlock your wings." Ice Blue answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why should I make this oath?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you don't swear, we will only I can do this. I must guarantee the safety of our people. If you fly back and tell the wizard king about our situation, we are in danger."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold look back Night wind. The wings of the night wind were tied to a weird rope cover, and her wings were straightened straight back and tied together. This way she can't rely on her hands to unlock the rope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then why don't you tie the crow that can only talk?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No need, the magic pet can't leave the owner too far. Otherwise it flies away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, what are you going to do?" asked Jin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We can't afford people who eat rice here. We want to eat and work! Xiaoxi, you assign jobs to them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah..." Kim was shocked, and he couldn't help but smile. "So, are you not afraid of us taking the opportunity to escape? Have you fled to Qianhu City to report the situation of the rebel army to the Wizarding King?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I naturally have confidence in this." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How do you deal with Miss Moon?" Xi Na, who had never spoken, suddenly shouted. Her hand clutched her clothes tightly and looked at the ice blue with anxious eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This depends on the evening meeting. But I am really surprised. As a therapist, why should you be with a wizard? You are not Natural enemies? And you are not like sisters."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is because...because..." Xena almost shouted, but in the end she did not say Export. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In short, if you don't want to go hungry, give me the job."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said Kim," Ugly said on the side of Kim's shoulder to comb the feathers and chattered. "Why do you want to listen to the ice blue, help cut the wood here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe want to help the rebel army." Kim smiled and came to In front of a big tree. He has an axe, but no one is around. So Kim put his hand directly on the tree. With a slight cracking sound, the tree fell slowly and the fracture was smooth and smooth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We have been together for almost five years, do you think I can't see it? You are curious." The black cone laughed, "You This is always the case. Every time I see the magical problem, I have to get it. But this is indeed strange. This band is obviously the magical reconnaissance scope of the wizard king. Why can’t he find the rebel army? What must the ice blue do? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And she is not afraid of us fleeing...what gave her confidence? Ugly, did you notice that the elf on her body is pulsating? She is not ordinary Man." Kim replied, and began to deal with the fallen tree. With the power of the Wind Blade, the branches of the tree were quickly cut off. In less than a minute, the whole tree has been cleaned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have some doubts about the terrain. Is it because this special type of land forms a disturbance to the magic, so that the wizard king can not detect it here? The reconnaissance magic that controls the territory is generally the 'eye of the distant eye', and there may be some other magic..." The black cone looked at the golden tree and took the clean big tree back, suddenly laughing again. "To be honest, I never thought that magic can be used like this... You just did a few minutes of work, ordinary people have to do a morning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why is the terrain?" Kim recalled the words of the black cone. This may be the only explanation. "Tonight we have carefully studied this terrain." He temporarily forgot other things and was immersed in this newly discovered complex issue. "Is the earth itself forming a magical array or forming an anomalous area of ​​the elves... or..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black cone spreads its wings, leaving gold alone to think about this complex Magic problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Umbrella flies over the valley. It puts the whole picture in the eye. Ice blue should not lie - it is not necessary. They should be organized spontaneously by the people in the vicinity who are dissatisfied with the tyranny of the wizard king, or even forced to organize. The night wind once said that the wizard king often carries out evil magic experiments... Is it because of the magic experiment? The pulsating spirit of the ice blue shows that she is also a caster - but it is not like the elf fluctuation caused by human magic, but like another race...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It suddenly laughed. What does all this have to do with it? Once Kim determined that what they were looking for was not in the rebel camp (if it was better in the camp), then he found an answer to the relationship between the nearby terrain and the reconnaissance magic, and everything was over. They will leave here... everything else has nothing to do with them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Uganda converged its wings and swooped down, aiming at a small flat in the valley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Wu cone?" Xi Na saw the black cone. "What about Mr. King?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don’t call Mr. Mr., too much, you can call me a black cone. The golden fool is cutting trees. Study while cutting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Research?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Skip the debris on the table with your feet. "What are you burning, so sweet!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s just broth..." Xena rubbed her hand on the apron. It can be seen from her actions, this girl is very good at this kind of thing. But her expression immediately sank. "I don't know how they will treat Miss Wuyue... tonight..." she said, and a few tears appeared in her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reassured and relieved...It’s a girl crying, trouble..." The black cone didn’t let the second sentence leave the throat, "Miss Moon will definitely Nothing. I have a black cone with personality - no, bird guarantee!" It patted the chest with its wings, and the funny movements caused Yuna to break into laughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, the black cone. Would you like to taste the soup?" Xina handed the spoon to the front of the black cone, and the black cone immediately put the mouth into the spoon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, it’s so delicious. Xina, your craft is really good." The black cone drank, and then greatly appreciated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's because Miss Moon is not going to cook, so these things are all I do." The girl smiled. "After doing more, there is "A little bit of it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Xi Na, you are really gentle and capable...much better than the shrew who has wings and no chest. She even burns No water." Wu cone laughed. "Your future husband can really be lucky for three."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Wu cone...you said The shrew with wings and no chest... Is it the Miss Night Wind?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." The Umbrella was surprised to look at Xi Na and found this girl. The look is a bit strange, as if shrinking something. "In addition to the shrew, who else... What do you want to say? Xi Na?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to say... Miss Night Wind...She..." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened to the shrew?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...she is behind you... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hand grabbed the black cone from behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A..." The black cone is stiff, and it mechanically turns its head and sees the night-faced iron-blue face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The shrew with wings and no chest..." The night wind forced a bite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah...the night wind... wait... listen to me..." Ugly yelled in a panic. A sudden smile appeared on the face of the night wind, making the black cone more panic. This smile often means that a vicious idea has been born. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wu cone, don't you say that I won't cook? Then I will show it to you!" The night wind unveiled the pot being cooked. Move the head of the black cone to a position half an inch from the boiling water surface. Blisters emerging from the bottom of the pot can be splashed directly onto the head of the black cone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Beautiful, kind, charming and passionate night wind lady..." The black cone looked at the boiling water that was boiling in front of her eyes and looked back at the night wind face. Vicious expression, swallowed hard. "Please forgive the mouth of a little crow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Little crow? I remember that you often call yourself the Umbrella Grandpa! You run alone What are you doing here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is for a lot of reasons..." The black cone raised the right response in the stomach. If it is a little wrong, it will have to go down the pan. "I actually came to inquire about the news..." It felt the hand of the night wind sinking down and scared it to scream. "Ah...help..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Please don't do this, Miss Night Wind." Xi Na spoke. She reached out and held the hand of the night wind. "It has apologized."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...the magicians carefully examined the nearby terrain with scouting magic, but did not find the half-orcs that had been hidden in the valley... The army of the half-orcs launched a raid, causing the marching human army to be defeated... The reconnaissance of magic is the four extremely prestigious Masters, which led them to make a hypothesis: special terrain will have an effect on the magic and even distortion. But for a long time, there is no evidence to support this hypothesis..." The voice recites a piece of text in memory. This is the only record that he remembered after his careful recollections. His heart couldn't help but feel a little excited. The recorded terrain was destroyed by the war, but now he has a complete example. This is a topic worth investigating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A subtle voice came, allowing Kim to wake up from his contemplation. The black cone has said more than once that he lacks the consciousness of the warrior, but after all, he is somewhat trained by some fighters, so he is somewhat vigilant. He followed the source of the sound and saw a child. The child is surprised and wide eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah!" Kim suddenly understood why the child would be surprised. In the process of thinking about the problem, he unknowingly changed from using hand-drawn wood to turning wood with magic. He immediately ended the magic, and the tree fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Scared you?" Kim smiled at the child. It was a little boy who was less than ten years old. The expression on his face showed that he was in the middle of the two emotions of panic and curiosity. Kim smile gave the child a little courage. He didn't go back and fled, but he was not far from Kim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this just magic?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Kim smiled, that The child's face has both admiration and fear. This is the attitude of mankind to magic, on the one hand, fear, on the other hand, worship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are a wizard?" The little boy took a step back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No. I am not a wizard." Kim sat down on the tree and gestured to the boy with a friendly gesture. The child walked over carefully but did not sit down. "It's not just wizards who can magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ice Blue sister will also magic." The child suddenly popped up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Really?" Kim smiled. He was not surprised by this answer - he was aware of the first time he saw ice blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is very powerful..." The child’s words suddenly turned. "I want to tell her about magic."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This... can't be used as a secret between us." Kim smiled, his hand swayed, and a flash of light appeared in his hand. "Use this as an exchange."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The child curiously came over and picked up the flash from the gold hand. It is a very beautiful necklace, the pendant is a small square with complex symbols. Even in the daytime, you can still see that the necklace is shining slightly. In short, this is a good thing that is absolutely deadly to children. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Children took the necklace from the hands of Kim, and looked at the left and right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's it, this is an agreement between men." Kim retracted his hand. "What is your name."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Deberga." The child replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My name is Kim. So, Debega, what are you doing here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A scream of screaming came from afar, and the whole body was shocked. He stood up and saw a bloody figure stumbling towards this side. A few more agile, faster figures are chasing the people ahead. They quickly caught up with the goal. The escaper was thrown to the ground and made a terrible dying cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Helping..." This is the last voice of the victim that Kim heard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is..." Kim hardly believes in his own eyes. "How is it possible?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A miserable shout broke the calm of the valley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ice blue directs the crowd on a small high ground. Some men picked up their weapons and gathered them around her. Others rushed into a cave in one side - from the number of people rushing in, this natural cave must be much larger than it looks outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several men rushed over and couldn’t help but pull away the night wind and Xi Na. On the other hand, the two rebel warriors grabbed the black stone house. month. All three of them were forcibly pulled into the cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ugly cone slaps its wings and flies to a safe, big tree branch. This location is all in sight. There are no idlers in the valley now, and the rebels have already prepared in a hurry. The soldiers were armed and stood by on a flat ground in front of the cave, and the ice blue commanded them. Others are all hidden in the cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black cone looks in the other direction. A figure is running towards this piece. Ordinary people's eyes may not see anything, but the black cone can be seen clearly. Kim took a child and was running towards it at a speed that normal humans could not reach. It seems that there is really a guy who is really good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gold, what do you see?" The black cone flew down from the big tree and greeted the gold. But without waiting for the gold answer, the black cone saw the figure that was chasing after the golden body, but the distance between them was farther and farther. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "God... meat?" After seeing the thing, even the black cone could not help but scream. "The wizard king actually created this kind of thing?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crow turned and flew. Together with Kim, I rushed to the place where the Rebel soldiers gathered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold ran quickly. When he was close to the crowd, he slowed down a bit. The meat eater behind him is always chasing after him. If it is an ordinary person, it will be caught up in the morning. Now, even the human eye can clearly see the chaser. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's throw!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't let the arrow!" Kim shouted, but it was too late. Almost all the people with the bows moved. Nearly a hundred magic arrows flew like raindrops, and most of them hit the target. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oops!" The black cone snorted. But it can only speed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meat of the arrow after the arrow went to the end, and it took a long distance to fall. Along with a huge explosion, the doll created with evil magic turned into pieces, and the green smoke filled the valley with the explosion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That smoke is poisonous!" Kim shouted loudly to those who didn't know anything. This sentence finally played a role. The Rebels stepped back before the green smog filled. The smog is extremely fast and does not dissipate. With no choice, Ice Blue commanded everyone to retreat into the cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Blocking the hole!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tool has been prepared near the hole. Stones, crushed sand, and soil together. People are more powerful, and people sealed the hole before the smoke arrived. What poison gas can't get in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The group of idiots!" The black cone fell back to the shoulder of gold, could not help but sigh. "The body odor of poisoned meat cockroaches will immediately attract other meat eateries. Now it can't really go out. God knows that the wizard king made a few... but no matter how many, they will be attracted here. Kim, how are you? "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is it?" Kim looked at his hand in a daze, talking to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ice Blue came to the gold side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know the things about those monsters?" she asked. But Kim is sinking into his own mind and has not heard the words of ice blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You made a big mistake." Another voice sounded, and the ice blue turned to look at it, but it was no moon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The monster you killed is called a meat eater. Destroyer warriors made by the scorpion. They are quick and fast, can resist most of the magic, have no intelligence, only have the instinct to prey on flesh and blood, and once killed, they will immediately cause an explosion that destroys everything around." No moon calm tone It seems to be recited. "The kind that is killed by you is called poisoned meat. Once destroyed, it will not only explode, but will also release poison gas. What's worse, this gas will lead other meats."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's made of living people." No moon answered with a feelingless tone. This tone made the people who heard it unable to hold a cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The damn wizard!" someone whispered cursing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then we can only stay here, wait for the poisonous fog and those who have dispersed?" asked the ice blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, it doesn't work for the meat eater." There is no cold smile. “If there is nothing that can attract them, they will stay outside and stupid. Unless there is a living person or another killed poisonous phlegm to attract them to leave.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"You lie! How is this..." Another person shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you don't believe it, wait for the poisonous mist to dissipate and dig a small hole and look outside." No moon still sneered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't regret it, as long as it has been realized, sooner or later it will be realized again." The black cone patted the gold on the brain. "So I said that you are sometimes too naive. But in order to study the carnivores, the wizard king must have done countless human experiments."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How to destroy these monsters?" Ice Blue then asked. "You can't hurt them, you can't be hurt by them..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Completely no way - unless you are willing to go with them. If it is the wizard king Another option is to use a wide range of ultra-long-range attack magic," No Moon answered. "But the wizards who can make such things should be able to easily protect their meats from this magical injury. Have you ever read history? If you read it, you will know that the unknown Master was leading the way. The army of flesh-eaters can defeat the king of the wizarding king, Bright. Even the masters of countless resources, a large army and subordinates, the king of wizards who are proficient in all kinds of magic and tactics are helpless to this kind of monster, let alone us. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence seems to be a dark cloud, and it is shrouded in the head of everyone. All the people who heard this were silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't believe the witch!" After a few minutes, Ice Blue The cave has gathered a corner to convene his own subordinates. "I suspect she is just an alarmist. And, as it turns out, as long as we use arrows, we can knock them down from a distance. Although it is poisonous, as long as the anti-drug measures are taken, it should not cause too much threat."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are we discovered by the wizard king?" Someone asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, if the wizard king discovers us, it will not send such a monster. He can destroy us all with one magic - then send His soldiers came to inspect our bodies. I think the wizard king released these monsters just because he could not determine our position."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They negotiated in a corner In the battle plan, no black bird was found hiding in a hidden position above the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey! Hey! Kim." The black cone fell to the shoulder of Kim. "They are going to attack the meat."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not looking for death... Don't you stop them?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop... Ugly, I am thinking, did I do something wrong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uu cone haha ​​laugh I slammed the gold head with my mouth. "What have you done wrong? In the beginning, there was no way to do this. Moreover, you have not taught anyone this knowledge. The wizards will make that kind of thing sooner or later because they have no constraints - even the most There is no basic morality." It looked at gold with a smiley eye. "Don't think that meat glutinous rice is a great creation. In fact, only enough human experiments are needed - as long as there is a living experiment, a person with a certain magical skill can make it."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you talking about?" No moon came over and looked at Kim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a large natural cave that is large enough to accommodate everyone. In fact, it is more than a hundred times more. If you calm down and feel slowly, you may feel a slight wind flowing. This shows that this hole must have some vents that are ventilated outside. And there is a lot of material reserves in the cave - for the time being they don't have to worry about anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They want to deal with the meat." No month carefully watched the expression of Kim, and Kim was watching her at the same time. Several torches provided the most basic lighting to the cave, giving her pale face a little blush. "I think you know a little bit of meat eating. They go out and die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold's face flashed an expression in a flash. He thought he was hiding well, but this moment he could not escape the eyes without moon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't you warn them?" No month asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that warnings are useless. They don't believe us." Kim replied. He turned his head and didn't want to continue to face the moonless sight. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yu Na said that you are a mercenary...but it doesn't look like it." "No month has changed a topic. "What is your identity? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am just a traveler...just a traveler." "Gold smiles." They said that you are a wizard... Are you really a wizard? He asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Witcher...maybe it." "No moon smiles, and I have some loose hair with a sly hand." Although the caster who does not rely on the Wraith Tower is called a magician is more appropriate. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The boundaries between the wizard and the magician are not so clear... the wizards are not falling from the sky, they are all created from Bright." After the technique of assisting the casting of the Wraith Tower, the past is changed from the ordinary magician. Unlimited magic..." Kim smiled and looked at no moon. "How tempting it is to the magician... How many people can stick to the ethics without falling?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are such a weirdo. "No moon quietly stood for a while, suddenly smiled. There was a rare smile on the pale face.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No moon turned and left, until she went far, the black cone was attached to the ear of gold.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A good one. "The black cone looks at the slender back of the moon and sighs.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ban shore flower? "Gold incomprehensible question.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you use a woman to compare flowers, the night wind should be counted as a rose, with a thorn;" Evaluation. "Xi Na can be plum, pure and aromatic, gentle but strong; and no moon is a flower. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ban shore flower... What does this mean? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can't see it? "The black cone began to comb the feathers." After all, your experience is still shallow. If you have the opportunity to contact her for a while, you will understand. Don't say this, the gang of rebel forces seem to be acting, and you will have no chance to stop it. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is true. The Rebels have already begun to act. They have moved non-combatants deep into the caves while preparing for protective gas and other things like wet towels. People are preparing their own weapons, mainly bows and arrows. After so long, the outside gas should have dissipated. The two soldiers dug a small hole for observation and looked out.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The gas is gone! After careful observation for a few minutes, someone announced it loudly. "But there are monsters!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How many? "Ice Blue asked.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are only two heads to see, but there may be more outside. They stood in the same place, looked around and didn't seem to be leaving. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is the distance? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are hundreds of steps..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are everyone ready?" ? ! Remember, the launch of a group of ten people, the person who finished shooting immediately retreats and re-starts the arrow. "Ice blue waved. Someone grabbed the hand she was waving.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it you? She looked at the man who suddenly popped out. "What do you want to do?" "She didn't panic because the man was empty, and she had a hundred fully armed officers around.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ice Blue wants to get rid of the gold hand, but Kim’s hand is very strong, and she can’t get rid of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let me go!" She looked at the captive coldly, and this man was defeated. "Let's mix. The witch is just an alarmist."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She didn't lie!" suddenly appeared in the golden brain, he may be able to use Spiritual magic forces this woman to be controlled. But this thought is fleeting, because he knows that powerful spiritual magic will leave eternal damage to the subject. "You don't know anything about meat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I only know that I just knocked down one." Ice Blue finally broke away from Kim's hand. "I didn't expect you to be a coward. Didn't you dare without the ancient magic sword?" She looked at Kim with a scornful look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The coward..." Kim couldn’t help himself. But he immediately relieved. Just as the Ukrainian reminded him, it is true that the Rebels did not believe him. After all, in their eyes, he is just a "walking dog of the witches", and is still a prisoner. He has no way and no position to convince these people to give up the plan of attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you must go out, let me go." Kim sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ice Blue looked at him but did not object. "Give him a crossbow." She ordered the men to one side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The black cone." Gold whispered to the crow. "Don't go out, if anything happens, it depends on you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are really too fraternal." Wu cone laughed and said, but No rejection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The preparation for the attack was completed quickly, and the debris that originally blocked the hole was cleared. But in order to be able to return at any time, many people are left ready to carry. The place where the poisoned meat eater was knocked down was still far away from the hole, so when the Rebel soldiers rushed out, they did not encounter the raid of the meat eater. The rebel army quickly rushed out and rushed to a slightly wider area—that is, the small black house that had been shut out of gold—to stop and raise the crossbow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the valley, at least one hundred meat eateres wandered around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Too much..." Kim heard someone whispering a curse. But now it’s too late to regret it, and the meat eater is keen. So nearly 50 people rushed out and they were immediately discovered. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "fire!" <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; The first wave of bows and arrows put out a few of their closest The carnivorous cockroach immediately became a hedgehog. Surprisingly, these monsters did not fall down and then explode as before, but rushed to the side as if they were not. The only thing to be thankful for is that they are not very fast, even slower than normal humans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Quick retreat..." Kim shouted to the ice blue, but Ice Blue ignored him. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "! The second batch of the arrow, fast"; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; <br <br /> & nbsp /> shot past the second wave, Ten in eight. But it still doesn't work. The monsters don't seem to be afraid of bows and arrows, and even seem to be something like the things they knocked down at noon. After the third wave of bows and arrows were shot, the stupid people understood that they had to retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Xingda, film... We left to cover, others retreated!" Ice blue loudly ordered. She turned her head and her body suddenly sluggish, and Kim noticed that her eyes were instantly lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No! Don't use magic!" Kim shouted and rushed up to interrupt the ice blue magic. Unfortunately, he is still a step late. In a twinkling of an eye, the few cockroaches that had just been clumsy suddenly became agile, as if something had stimulated their motor nerves. Ice Blue wants to use the power of the wind to further block the speed of the meat eater, but the result is counterproductive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meat that rushes to the front of the meat eater (the one with the most middle arrow) seems to have loaded the spring, and it’s difficult to change the delay. The power of confidence rose high, and the people behind the temple rushed. Kim looked up and saw the monster's body falling from the sky against the sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oops..." The most troublesome thing happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Flash!" There is no chance of warning or doing anything else. Gold only had time to catch the ice blue and another person fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Boom!" The huge explosion of air blew everything. The energy that is compressed to the extreme is released, like the galloping horse, and all the things in front of this energy are shattered like paper. The flesh and blood fragments are flying all over the sky, falling like a holiday fireworks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Too bad..." Kim got up. Even with his body, he can't face this kind of impact without defense, let alone ordinary people. Except for the two people who were pulled down by him, everyone else disappeared - forever disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong!" Ice Blue also climbed up. When she was pulled down by Kim, she just fell into a depression and suffered almost no harm. But the other person was not so lucky, one of his arms was blown off, and the wound was bloody. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go!" Kim grabbed some of the icy blues. Other meat eateres did not pay attention to the three of them, but began to chase those who returned to the cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go into the house!" Kim turned and looked at it, there is no other choice. The front of the meat eater that ran away blocked their way back from the cave. Further, among the more monsters that come in, many of them are toward them. There is only one choice left at this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go!" He suddenly yelled and his voice was full of anger. So many lives disappeared forever, and he suddenly burst into anger. He doesn't know why he is angry, is it ice blue? Maybe because of myself? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait, we can't leave Kane..." Ice Blue desperately wants to help the wounded on the ground. Kim pushed her away and picked up the Rebel soldier named Kane. This poor guy is already in a coma. "Come on!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They rushed into the black stone house and closed the door. The meat eater is a step behind and can only hold the thick wooden door outside. The lock on this door was originally locked from the outside, but the intelligence of the meat is not high enough to know how to work on the door handle. They are just futile attacks and scratching the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Call..." Kim exhaled. He put down the wounded in his hand. "Temporarily safe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How else is it!" Ice Blue stood in the room and suddenly thought of another, more serious problem. Those who retreat do not know if they will be caught up by the meat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Rest assured, I took a look at the house before entering the house. The hole has been blocked again in time. There will be no one in the hole for a while. "Gold answered." He began to examine the wounds of the wounded. The poor guy has blood flow in his broken arm, which will endanger life. The bad thing is that he has nothing to stop bleeding in his hand, only magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold slowly releases strength, he has no ability to heal, but he can stop bleeding. With the power of magic, the speed of blood flow begins to slow down, until it stops bleeding. This person named Kane is completely incomprehensible. Throughout the process, he only made a few screams that didn't know what it was, and seemed to be shouting someone's name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a roar of carnivorous animals. This group of monsters wants to rush in. But this stone house is extremely solid, otherwise it will not be held prisoners. Unless they detonate themselves, they can come in for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood is finally flowing. Kim loosened the wounded and stood up. It was only then that he found that Ice Blue was sitting in the corner of the house, staring at the door that kept coming and swaying. This way reminds Kim of another person not long ago, no moon. At that time, no moon was like the ice blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You shouldn't use magic." Kim sighed. "Magic will irritate the meat, make them faster, more agile, and more powerful. You knock down the poisonous meat eater at noon, and that kind of thing is easy to knock down - they are created to be knocked down by the enemy, so as to guide others. The attacking direction of the meat eater." He looked at the ice blue with some stunned eyes. "Forget it, it is too late to say that."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you know? I used magic?" Silence for a while, Ice Blue asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This...in short, I just know. Is your magic not a human magic?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"In any case, meat can not be stimulated by magic. Which kind of magic is the same. They were originally created to destroy the Master."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You It seems to be very familiar with carnivores." Ice blue whispered in a vigilant tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, probably no one is more familiar with me." Gold replied casually. His attention focused on the sound of the outside of the meat eater, not paying attention to the strange taste in the ice blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who are you?" The sword against the neck brought gold back. He turned half a head and saw that the thunderbolt sword had been added to the ice blue, and the blade had blue light in front of his throat. "You are not an ordinary person, I should have thought of it. How can ordinary humans bear the power of my sword? Are you a spy of the Witch King?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You come in the morning, the meat meal at noon is here, the time is too close... I thought at the beginning that the wizard king didn't know where we were invisible, but I forgot that there is still a possibility. Because there is a spy in it, so He can't use mass destruction magic..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold smiles and gently pushes the sword against his throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't show the way to eat people," Kim's hand encountered resistance, so he gave up his plan to push the sword further. "Your reasoning is very interesting, but if I am a subordinate of the Witch King, I just probably only fell on my own and will not pull you and him again." Kim smiled at the ice blue, looking at each other, gold You can clear the face of the ice blue. A little high blood of the goblin left her with some indescribable features, and the heart of Kim suddenly moved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And, if you laugh, it will be more beautiful than it is now," he continued. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ice Blue slowly took the sword back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Before you are not a spy." She turned her head and went to the wounded to see the injury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not their leader." Kim looked at the ice blue. Hearing this, the body of the ice blue shook all over, and after a few seconds she looked up at Kim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why do you say that?" Her eyes were like sharp edges, trying to pierce the heart of gold. However, Kim’s smiling expression is an impenetrable shield, hiding everything under this expression. "Of course I am the leader. Who told you this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No need to say anything, the blind man also looks out. Can rise up against the wizard king, There must be a strong leader, not a person who has to deal with others to make a meeting to decide. Although it hurts people's self-esteem, as far as I can see, you don't really have the qualification to be a leader." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold slowly finished, and the ice blue seemed to be jumped up like a needle, holding the sword in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you say?!" She screamed at her sword, but Kim could feel the weakness behind this anger. “Where am I doing something wrong?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “First, underestimating the ability of the wizard king. Take the risky move when there is no need for adventure. Personally, it may be an advantage, but in the position of the leader, this is an unforgivable defect." Kim looked at the ice blue face, and with his words, the anger on the ice blue face slowly calmed down. "Second, ignore the opinions of others. Do not do the necessary reconnaissance and temptation without knowing it. Third, do not arrange for accidents."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Ice blue bites his teeth, but he can't refute it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wounded groaned in a coma, he was still calling a name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are right..." The ice blue that just angered suddenly burst into anger. "I am just a brother's deputy... I really don't fit." a leader..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your brother?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Has a month ago, he was In a battle, he was killed by the wizard king's men..." Ice blue went to the corner and sat down, staring blankly at the small window on the ceiling. "I have no other choices, only temporary...become a leader..." She suddenly showed a rare smile, full of sorrow. "Actually, I also know that I am really not suitable because the leader is really tired... too tired..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's weird, why do I say so much to you... Are you called Kim? You can see it, you are not an ordinary person." Ice blue laughed at himself. In this special light, Kim actually saw her hair blue. "You are not like the maid of the witches... Who are you? What are you doing here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am just an ordinary traveler, just It’s just a traveler.” Kim replied with a smile. "I am chasing a caravan. They have something I need. They are in Qianhucheng in two or three days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am afraid you have not Opportunity, in the current Qianhu City, there are no other living people except the soldiers of the Wizarding King."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't know...Yes, you really shouldn't know. The wizard king is doing a terrible experiment... all the people in the city have been killed by him. Recently he ordered The surrounding villages all entered the city...we wanted to convince them, but no one believed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All the people in the city were killed...though The wizard king is very cruel, but... this is really unbelievable..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe to make this terrible monster... cruel live experiment . . . We are only despicable experimental materials in the eyes of the wizarding king..." Ice blue whispered, she was sitting on her knees and seemed to be immersed in some kind of In memory. "Say it, maybe you don't believe it. My ancestors used to be a lord. I also have aristocratic ancestry... But after the rise of the wizards, almost all of the people who resisted them were killed... my family is the same. Because the family In the reason of this high leprechaun pedigree, my family was killed by the Wizarding King, only my brother took me out. Since then, I have vowed to be an enemy of the wizards in this life..." She whispered With. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "God..." The wounded gave a painful embarrassment and interrupted the ice blue. He has opened his eyes and is awake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't move...Kane...nothing." Ice blue rushed over and tried to comfort. The wounded face was pale and his lips had turned blue. His body trembled with violent pain. The wound blood has stopped, but he has flowed too much blood before. Under the common attack of two strong enemies, pain and excessive blood loss, this poor man has been very weak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Help..." Kane - the name of the wounded - shouted. He saw his wound, and the hand that left the residual limb fainted again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn... what to do..." Ice Blue looked at the wounded, but he could only do it urgently, no way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He is dying." Kim checked and came to a conclusion. "Hemostasis is too late... The temperature is not enough... Without treatment, he can't drag it for too long."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Right, there is a therapist ..." Ice Blue suddenly thought of a person, but this joy immediately dissipated. Now, how can this situation go back to the hole? They simply can't go out. Although there was no movement outside the meat eater, it was obviously waiting for the people inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold carefully thought about it, he already had an idea. He suddenly thought that if the black cone was by his side, the crow would definitely try to oppose his idea at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wake up!" He patted the wounded face. The wounded woke up and woke up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "God...a lot of blood..." He looked around and made a noise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If this continues, you will die." Kim looked at the wounded, with no expression on his face. "I have a way to save you, but it will cause more pain. You choose to die without pain in a coma, or suffer from pain. I don't want to force you, but I want to tell you, that kind of The pain is terrible, definitely beyond the scope of your imagination. Do you choose to die?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No..." Although the wounded were weak, the words were still clear. In this case, this choice is the instinctive response of most humans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to do?" Ice blue puzzled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
