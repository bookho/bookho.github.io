When he stood up, he was about to collapse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Everyone has nothing to do!" Kim asked in a gasp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing to blame!" Lev didn't swear, he still can't stand up. In addition to Babe's impact, he also suffered a lot in the storm, his head, hands, and all exposed places are blue and scarred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is resting in place, only Elna is treating everyone – it’s so lucky to have a therapist as a companion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right! Wei? And Mingke?" After the easing of the gas, Kim found that the number was a few. In fact, this can't blame him. Under such a terrible environment, it is impossible to carefully confirm the number of partners. He can only help people who are closest to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassured, they should be fine!" This kind of comfort is really not convincing, because Behan himself knows that the two must be fierce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's find it!" Elna stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the sun just showed a little glory, Mink woke up. The reason for him to wake up is that something is crawling on his calf and itchy. He naturally used his hand to scratch the itchy place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hand touched something that was a bit hard and still moving. In the confusion, Mink grabbed the thing and wanted to put it. Pulled open, but the pain that came from the accompanying leg. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wow!" The pain caused the sleepiness to be rushed, and the boy made a scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei Yiyue, out of a warrior's instinct, his sleep is not very deep. This way he can always be the first to react after hearing any abnormal noise. While jumping up, even when the eyes have not been opened, the long sword in the waist has been unsheathed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without any enemies coming in, Wei only saw the juvenile lying on his side desperately squatting. Wei immediately reacted, and the sword swayed and opened the trousers of the teenager. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A scorpion is on Mink’s calf. This creature hides in the cave during the day to escape the sun, but it will come out at night. The scorpion accidentally climbed into Mink's trousers and couldn't climb out—maybe he didn't want to climb out, who knows it—when it was accidentally attacked, it naturally used its own tail. Although there was no hand in the middle of Mingke, the monk who escaped could not escape the temple, and his calf was paralyzed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We used a gesture to stop Mink’s screams and ineffective movements – Mink also wondered why this man can make himself a mess from this mess. Calm down - and then a precise sword split the scorpion into two pieces but did not let Jianfeng touch Mink's foot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the body of the scorpion fell, Wei immediately squatted down and carefully examined the damage caused by the scorpion. This scorpion is not a poisonous one, but also Enough to make a huge red-violet lumps appear on Mink's original white tender legs. Wei does not have much research on detoxification, but he knows a cure for all poisonous bites. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We pulled out a knife from his waist. He looked up at the boy. Mingke knew what Wei was going to do. He nodded and then bite tightly. Live your lips and close your eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We used a knife to draw two intersecting holes on the lumps, and then began to suck the blood with the venom inside the mouth and spit it out. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wound on the leg came from a more intense pain because of sucking, and Mink opened his eyes, and he watched Wei being taking a bite from his wound. Absorb bleeding water. Mink looked at Wei's action for taking drugs for him. It was very strange. Unconsciously, the pain in his legs seemed to be less intense, and a kind of warmth began to spread. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei Wei took a moment, Ming Ke knew that this was a bit rude, and he quickly turned his face. Wei thought that his mouth was full of blood. He was the reason for Mingke's gaze. He immediately took out the water bag and drank a small mouthful of water to gargle (water is very valuable). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a little bit of Mingke’s bandaging, Wei sorted out things and was ready to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei came to the front of the boy (Minke was sitting), and he expressed his meaning in a posture - he wanted to clarify the road. But the teenager quickly resigned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter, I can go!" Mink stood up with the help of his hand. He wanted to show Wei that he can continue to walk. But the painful instep of the foot rebelled against his will. When the injured right leg landed, his body slammed and fell uncontrollably to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We used one hand to hold the Mink who almost fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Big Brother, you can just help me, just wait, it will be fine, nothing..." But Wei also saw that Mink just didn't want to Let yourself become cumbersome (of course, another reason, because of the preconceived reason, he did not see it.), he did not listen to the interpretation of the juvenile, regardless of his opposition (author's note: you can imagine this scene: Mink is only symbolic Opposing, she is actually half-pushing.) Put the boy on his back and start. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the sun came out, the five talents woke up, they were really tired It is. In order to find discrete companions yesterday, they did not rest until midnight. When everyone got up this morning, they didn’t have much spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think... maybe... Wei and Mingke, both of them..." When everyone was ready to leave, Lev said and cleaned up in a vague tone. Everyone is guessing, but no one wants to say a hypothesis. Lev didn't finish, but everyone knows what he wants to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We must look for it again!" Blonde said, "Like our agreement, look for two days first, if you can't find it, then return to Huo. Going to Pucheng, etc."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone acquiesced to Kim’s conclusion and began a tracing action that did not hold much hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"General! Found a bonfire that is still extinguished soon!" at noon sun When the most sinister, a soldier brought a good news to General General Gera, which is no different from ice cream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take me to see you right away!" Gera wants to confirm this important clue with her own eyes. Hearing this news, his spirits are coming up, in despair. The hope in the middle is really the best stimulant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s really a camp, at least two people spend a night here. Gera did not order to start immediately, catching up quickly, and he began to analyze all the information he had. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several adventurers who have survived the storm! This is the first thought, but Gera feels that it is incredible to survive in this storm. If the adventurer is really hit by the storm, it must be the end of the army. It is rare to see that the Orcs have a good understanding of magic. If they are not hit by the storm, then what about the cloak? Unless...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gera began to overestimate the adventurers who did not know the pursuit of the soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, it must be! Gera thought she had seen through the adventurer's plan. The adventurers must have safely escaped the storm, but deliberately took some things away from the storm, causing the illusion that they have been wiped out by the storm, hoping that the pursuers will give up the idea of ​​chasing. It was a pity that I was swayed by myself - relying on the blessing of God of War, I did not see the cloak and gave up and chased - now they can't escape! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All collections!" Gera ordered, now there is no need to find the bodies of those guys without any goal, they are still alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the soldiers gathered, another thought jumped into Gera’s mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s not, is this camp a trap for those guys?" Gera said to herself, from the scale of the camp, the people in the camp It’s definitely much smaller than the first camp they found, and it’s quite suspicious. Since those adventurers can think of the illusion of death with a cloak, it is quite possible to make a fake camp to deceive the enemy in the wrong direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that Eros is not willing to disturb a pair of men and women who have fate. The half-orc wolf cavalry stopped moving in the direction of Wei and Mink. They turned a big bend and slammed in the other direction. Unfortunately, they In the way forward, there are five adventurers looking for companions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Big Brother, are you tired, stop and take a break!" Mink put his mouth to Wei's ear and said to him gently. Although he knew that Wei was wearing a heavy all-in-one armor, it was not a relaxing thing to go back one person on the back. He could see the sweat on Wei's head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minck’s condition is very good, the pain on his feet is slowly disappearing, and the redness is gradually subsiding. In addition to Wei's sunscreen cloak on him, he did not suffer from the sun. However, Wei is under the sun's hotline—although the Mink on the back can block some of the sunlight, but after all, it can't be as good as a cloak—some of his armor is very hot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We didn’t answer, he wasn’t really tired. For him, Mink’s body is actually very light, not a burden – if it’s worn If you are used to the whole body armor, no one will think how heavy the light body of Mink is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 02<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not tired!" Wei Ben came to say this, but his The throat was no longer able to speak, and because both hands were holding the body of Mink, there was no way to answer, he just continued to move forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have searched a large range today, and found no clues, and the hopes in my heart have slowly changed. He didn't know how fast the black storm was. He could advance several kilometers per minute. It is normal to throw two people into two places far apart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At noon, two people found a shadow corner that could avoid the sun, rest and have lunch here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think, they may..." Mink spoke in a tone similar to talking to himself, but there was no expression on Wei's face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They should be fine!" Wei said slowly, "I have a wonderful feeling! This feeling tells me that they are safe and sound, at least I am safe now. Believe me, if we can't find them here, then we can wait for them in Hope City!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Right Drink a little more water! Big brother, you must be thirsty!" Mink picked up the water bag. But Wei took the water bag and only drank a little. Although I felt very thirsty, I saw that Wei only drank a little, and Mink didn't drink too much. He only drank a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get off!" Wei stood up, although the wound on his leg was actually not very painful, but Mink did not refuse, he once again turned back. Wei's back - it is very happy to be so close to the man you like. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Seeing something is not there!" In the following Lev is really there A little impatient, the magician has been flying into the sky for so long, still did not get any news! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden float did not answer Lev in heaven, he is now observing the situation around him, he can't move in the sky, in the wilderness of the Orcs, the power of the wind elves Either very violent or very weak, the wing magic is almost impossible to use here, he can float up, but if you want to move, the speed is slow and slow like a snail, and suddenly can not stand it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no silence around, there is nothing moving around. When Kim turned his body again, he suddenly felt as if he was seeing something moving. It is not like, it is indeed something moving! At the limit of sight, it seems that there is a line of black and yellow that is creeping! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold is immediately nervous, and unexpected things in this place usually mean danger, he starts to use the magic of assisted vision (this is far-sighted - that is The prototype of the magic attached to the crystal inside the palace can see a wide range of situations, but is easily interfered by other magic. Under the influence of magic, Kim’s vision temporarily departed from the body and bet on the far side of the vast wilderness. He saw what it was. It was a large group of wolf cavalry, a chase for the half-orcs! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The half-orc is chasing it!" Kim has not yet touched the ground, and Kim announced the emergency message to his partners. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Everyone has not been able to come to life for a while. Adventurers have always used their own opinions to analyze the Orcs. No one thought of half. The orcs will catch up with the adventurers who have run away for a captive. Therefore, their plans only to rescue the hostages from the military camp, did not consider further escape plans, and even a detour is also proposed by Behan for the temporary prevention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The half-orc came, they can catch up with us in less than an hour!" The expression on the gold face clearly shows that this is definitely not a joke, but The fact of a hundred thousand rush! After a brief discussion, everyone gave up the idea of ​​fleeing separately. The number of half-orcs is enough. You can find them in several ways. Don’t say that they only have five (baby is not counted), that is, double the orcs. You can also grab them all. If you can't think of a strange strategy, they don't want to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it’s impossible to face the battle. Their biggest estimate is that they can only kill 100 orcs, but now there are more than 100 orcs. The number of gold to see, the minimum number of half-orcs is also 1,000. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let me call Warcraft!" Babe proposed a way, indeed, a powerful Warcraft can deal with the Orcs, if you can summon like that ice A snake-like Warcraft, even if it can't destroy half-orcs, there must be no problem to drive them away. However, this is not a forest that is easy to hide, but an unobstructed wilderness. Although half-orcs may not be able to attack World of Warcraft, they must attack the adventurers. Warcraft cannot completely block the half-orcs in such a large space. Activities - At that time, the Orcs will definitely shun the World of Warcraft to kill the unrestrained babe. This opinion has been rejected, and it is better not to conflict with the half-orcs unless it is a last resort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use a magic to dig a hole to hide, Lev this method was vetoed by himself, the wolf's sense of smell can easily find the hidden adventurer to find out It is useless to hide where. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time is getting less and less, the half-orcs are getting closer, but the adventurers have no way, but it’s not their fault, no In the case of preparation in advance, there is really no way to safely escape the chasing of the Orcs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behan pulled out the sword of the earth, he has given up the idea of ​​retreating, he is determined to die. In addition to him, Elna, Lev, have the same plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the way the partners are ready to fight, Kim’s heart suddenly has an idea, a noble idea – he wants to sacrifice himself to protect his companions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold looked at Lev, who was standing on the side. This thief was the one who was with him from the beginning. Although there was a bit of jealousy and greed, in the battle, He is definitely a reliable companion, and his flying knives and short bows often pose a huge threat to the enemy. Moreover, he has always been a good friend. Beside him is the magic swordsman Behan, his combat skills are not as wonderful as Wei, but it is undoubtedly an excellent warrior. In the past battles, whenever Wei Chong went out to attack the enemy, Behan always stayed. At the side of others, use the long sword in his hand to resist all attempts to attack players who are not good at melee. Moreover, he is the most travel experience in the team. When the team is planning, he can always put forward some useful opinions. Standing next to Behan is a therapist. She can be said to be one of the most useful players. It is both a warrior who can fight with the enemy and a battle that gives everyone no worries. After the end of the battle, she ignored her own pain and fatigue. She first treated others. Only after everyone returned to normal did she start treating herself. The last one is Babe on his side. The little girl’s performance in the adventure is no worse than other adults. At the crucial time, she never retreats, but calmly directs the Warcraft she summoned. These partners can't die here. If someone must sacrifice, then only one is enough! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't worry! I think, I can deal with them!" Kim opened his mouth, and other companions turned to look at the magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You... Is there any good way?" The companions looked at Kim’s eyes with some doubts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassured, anyway, I am a magician!" Kim tried his best not to make his face look abnormal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be too reluctant!" Levdo added. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be careful!" When she left, Elna sighed again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold is left alone, and after confirming that his partners have not left any noteworthy traces, he stood up and offered his prayers to the gods. Wen, very quickly, the magic is full of his whole body, every blood vessel, every cell feels the call of magic, he confirms that he is now in a state of full prosperity. After applying a few preventive magics to himself, he quietly waited for the arrival of the Orcs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orc finally appeared in the scope of the field of vision, and it is still very far away. Maybe the Orcs have not been able to notice him, so Kim stood still. He is close to waiting for the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jella is riding a very good wolf, he has been rushing At the forefront of the team, when he was rushing, his eyes suddenly seemed to find something. With his order, the entire team stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing wrong, there is indeed a figure in front, it is definitely not a rock or something, that figure belongs to a human being, an adventurer, and they are going to catch up The goal! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adventurer did not seem to find the half-orc wolf cavalry behind the brigade, he still used a speed that was not slow or slow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only one? Gera carefully checked, but it was only found one. In any case, this task has already fallen. In addition to excitement, he ordered the whole army to advance, and, in particular, ordered to catch the living. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wolf cavalry drives the mount and rushes to the distant figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the wolf's footsteps are relatively light, so many claws will still cause considerable sound. The figure in front clearly noticed the chase behind him. He began to speed up and wanted to escape. But this is a delusion, how do you run four legs on two legs? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 03<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the closer distance between the two sides, Gera can be clear Seeing each other's appearance, it is indeed an adventurer. After seeing that there was no hope of escape, the adventurer—now knowing that he was a magician—flyed with magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chasing! The wolf cavalry does not wait for the order, it is very tacit to form a very loose half-moon formation, chasing the goal of the sky, the half-orc knows how long it will not fly in the sky, as long as the power of the magician is exhausted, he Still have to fall, just stare at him, don't let him disappear from the field of vision. They all looked at the magician carefully, for fear that he would throw away any attacking magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold looked back at the wolf cavalry on the ground, and he was glad that all the orcs had been attracted to him. The farther they are drawn away, the safer they are. Although the power of the wind's elves is very unstable, flying magic can still be used (unfortunately, you can't use the wing magic, or you can kill the half-orcs). He didn't know that the Orcs wanted to catch him, so he tried to keep speed and height so as not to become a target for bows and arrows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold is not thinking about using the curse to destroy the half-orc, the impression that the thunderbolt gave him is very deep, but he only knows the curse A thunderbolt is out, and the thunderbolt is definitely not suitable for use under such conditions. It takes time to accumulate power, and the range of magic is limited. It is suitable for destroying a city, but in this wilderness, the half-orcs can definitely hide from the attack. Since there is no way to destroy the enemy, then they should be led as far as possible so that the partners can have enough time to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s really tiring to use flying magic in this ghost place! In the legend, the half-orc wilderness is an ancient war (the gods have proved that the race they created is the best, so they have a great battle for their creations. In this war, nearly half of the races on the mainland were The product of extinction.) is the curse of the gods. It seems that this legend is very likely to be true. Not only is the environment and climate unusually bad, but the power of the elves is also very unstable. But the power of gold is really good. He has no problem in introducing a half-orc to a few hundred kilometers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-orc is chasing the magician who flies in the sky, and other adventurers are heading toward the oasis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reassured, he must have any way to deal with those half-orcs!" Don't look at Lev to say that, in fact, he has no bottom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We should believe in gold!" said Behan on the side. "He will lead the half-orcs! We are waiting in the oasis to wait for him." The practice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone agrees with Behan’s statement that they are accelerating their way to the oasis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is dark, Wei chooses a safer place - that is The location of the poisonous insects is unlikely to occur - arrange the camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei carefully arranged everything, and once again carefully examined the wound on Mingke's foot.蜇 明 明 蝎 蝎 蝎 明 明 明 明 明 明 明 明 明 明 明 明 明 明 明 明 明 明 明 明 明 明 明 明 明 明 明 明 明 明 明 明 魏 魏 魏 魏 魏 魏 魏 魏 魏 魏 魏 魏 魏 魏 魏It seems that there is no problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you still hurting?" Wei asked Mink in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not very painful!" The teenager gently rubbed a few feet to prove that he was in good shape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a short dinner, Wei put the bonfire a few times - in order to make it burn longer - and then leaned on a large rock. Wei likes this feeling. Looking at the stars on the rocks is his favorite thing in his spare time. If it weren't for that change, he might be sitting at the entrance to the village, and discussing the stars with his brothers and sisters and teachers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Wei let his body and mind recover from a complete state of relaxation, he found that the boy is leaning on his side, he has been relying on himself Together (because there is a layer of armor, Wei does not feel it). The boy has fallen asleep, and a slight snoring has already sounded inside his nose. Wei moved a bit, he wanted to leave without disturbing the other side, but the young man’s center of gravity rested on him. When he moved, the teenager slipped down his body, and finally the whole upper body leaned on Wei’s body. Sitting on the thigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are no longer moving, he is not willing to wake up this boy, he just quietly watching the young and quiet sleepy look. Wei gently lifted a handful of hair scattered on the boy's face. The teenager's sleepy pattern reminded him of his relatives. He used to slumber his younger brothers on his lap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the silent memory of the past, Wei’s eyes slowly closed, and the sleeping god wrapped her tired warrior with her veil. Into the world of dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The calm night passed, and when the East appeared white, the soldier’s eyes opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teenager who is still on his lap is still asleep. Wei tries to gently remove the boy’s head and replace his leg with a stone. But his movements have not yet been completed - the hands have just lifted the head of Mink - the teenager also opened his eyes. He immediately turned over and sat up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minke understood that he was leaning on Wei’s leg yesterday night, and his face immediately turned red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry! Big Brother..." Wei used a gesture to stop Mink's apology because he thought that Mingke did not cause much inconvenience to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Get off!" After cleaning up, Wei made this gesture to the boy, and he plans to go back on the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Big Brother! My feet are gone! No back!" Indeed, although the ground is still a little painful, it is nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although he did not recite the boy again, Wei still held him with one hand. He also looked at it, and now it’s helpful to take a look at the body and recover from the injury on the foot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have decided not to look for partners anymore. He started to move south. Although he can’t judge his position, there is nothing wrong with going south. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the first brief period of comfort, the sun in the wilderness appeared, and the fireball projected the heat enough to boil the eggs into this unobstructed land. on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Big Brother! This cloak is still for you! I can walk in your shadow, it doesn't matter!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't care! I used to Have been trained like this! Rest assured!" Wei signed the boy with a sign. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the sky is at noon - after all, Mink’s legs have not fully recovered, so the speed of walking is slower – the sun reaches a day In the strongest moment, Wei was exposed to the sun, and Mink reached out to meet Wei's armor. He couldn't help but retract his hand immediately—it was too hot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Big Brother! Or you use this cloak! Your body is hot!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "No need!" Wei refused - he has suffered more than this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you don't wear it, then I don't wear it! The clothes on my body are much better than your armor." Mink took off his cloak from his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei’s face showed a smile. He realized that the boy was completely for his sake. He could not refuse this kindness, but he could not let this boy be exposed. In the sun, he used a compromise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mingke leaned close to Wei’s side, Wei opened the cloak and provided shame to two people. Although it is a little inconvenient for two people to walk in this way, they can finally escape the terrible daylight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wolf cavalry jumped down the mount and swooped over, the four orcs were tight Put the already exhausted magician down on the ground - they can't despise the magician, he flew in the sky for nearly six hours. However, this chase has finally come to an end, and they finally caught the adventurer alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, this is your limit!" The magician had a little hope, that is, he can keep flying to the night, if he can stick to the night. Even if the half-orc can find him, he will have to pay a lot of trouble. However, the reality is cruel. He exhausted all the power when he reached the evening, and finally fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forget it, at least your peers must be safe now. A rough estimate, the distance between the half-orc and the companions is now at least 100 kilometers. Kim closes his eyes and waits for a sword to puncture his throat or heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Orcs did not do what he thought. After wearing a grotesque handcuffs, he was dragged with a wolf that was unwilling to be taken by humans, and was sent back to the half-orc by twenty soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he has already caught one, Gera is still not very satisfied. He feels that he should catch a few more to get back to the king of the tooth. At the same time, because Kim wants to open their intentions is too obvious, so the half-orc has long been suspicious, he did not take long to chase out a part of the troops continue to follow the original direction. It is time to join these forces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All collections!" Gera issued the order! Because the chasing and scattered wolf cavalry began to slowly merge, after half an hour, Gera was satisfied to see that his men had been completely assembled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come on the ground, rest tomorrow, continue to hurry!" Today is really tired, it is really not easy to catch this magician, I hope other humans Don't run like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 04<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a green color in front of it. If this is not a mirage (in fact, there is no mirage on the half-orc wilderness), it means an oasis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing a vibrant oasis bringing infinite joy to two people who have gone under the scorching sun, two people speed up their steps and want to arrive before dusk The place of life. However, with the encouragement of hope, their speed has increased a lot. In fact, they did not take much time to arrive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can now take off the cloak that is too small for two people to use. The shade of the trees obscures the still sinister sunshine. Two people are here. Enjoy the shade of the hard to see in this wilderness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ming Ke is kneeling by the river. He picks up the river with his hands to drink. This sweet river is really an incredible gift to a person who has been in the wilderness for a day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I looked back at Wei, Mingke had filled all the two water bags. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you find anything?" Mink looked up and asked Wei. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No! We are probably the first to embark on this oasis!" Wei replied with his gesture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minke relaxes and lies on a green grass by the river. The environment here is very similar to his home. He used to like lying in the garden. On the lawn, but there is no such comfort and happiness as it is now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although still early in the dark, but sitting on this soft grass, the day’s sleepiness has come up, after lying quietly for a while Mink entered the dreamland unconsciously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Mingke woke up, the sky was already dusk, he rubbed his hand with his hand, the sun was falling from the west, but still half face . The sun has changed from sinister to hard-to-get softness, reflecting a golden yellow on the river. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei also fell asleep, and he sat down on a tree not far from the river. Mingke walked gently to Wei's side, and he could see it. Wei had already slept very well. Walking in the sun this morning made him consume too much physical strength. After seeing Mingke fall asleep, Wei can't resist the sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei’s eyes open, his sleep has always been very shallow, this It is a skill that must be learned as a swordsman. Therefore, even in this comfortable environment, he sleeps more alertly - although the sound of tapping the river is small, he can wake him up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After opening your eyes, the right hand naturally slipped into the position of the sword at the waist. Wei heard the sound of someone playing in the water. This voice is in this quiet The place is particularly noticeable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei’s eyes swept around, and he immediately found the source of the sound, as he guessed, that Mink was bathing in the river. Wei had come to look at it and decided to keep his eyes closed, but his eyes immediately stopped when he met the nakedness in the river. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a female body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who drunk in the river turned their faces, Wei can now confirm everything, this person who bathes in the river is Ming Ke, they take It is not a teenager but a girl who is in danger of saving her life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are so many strange things to answer now, when they are traveling in the wilderness, Mink always stays away from his place. Wei originally thought it was the habit of the nobility. Now I really want to come to myself and I have too much vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why didn’t you see that this is not a very clever disguise? Wei carefully asked himself, and now think of it, this is all preconceived ideas at work. At the time of the city war in Hope City, Mink first met him. In that environment, of course, it is impossible to judge the gender of the other person carefully. It is natural to mistake her for a teenager. This first impression is the basis of the future. He never considered the gender problem of Mink. When traveling in the wilderness (just two or three days), because wearing a cloak to resist the sun, no one – even the female experienced Beckham – noticed the fact that Mink was a girl. To be honest, if you sleep in Mink, you may not realize this fact at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I woke up from my meditation, Wei suddenly realized that she had been staring at the naked face of a bathing girl, and she realized how bad her behavior was. After politeness, he turned his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although telling himself that it’s all because of an accident, he definitely hasn’t peeked, but a feeling that has been long gone for a long time suddenly came back – since that happened After the tragic change, there is no longer this feeling - Wei began to feel a fever on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl in the river is amazed at the change of the sleeping soldier. In fact, if Wei does not move, he can watch the wonderful scene for a long time. Even the authors are He felt a pity, a rare opportunity.) Wei’s original posture turned her back to her. Needless to say, she could know what happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei slowly turned his head. He just saw Mingke coming to him. Mink's hair was still very wet. He was dripping with water. Obviously, she was dressed in a hurry. Now, if you look at Mink in a way that evaluates women, Mink is actually very beautiful. Although there is no long hair flowing for the sake of travel, the hair style between men and women does not hide her slight beauty. Except for the corset, her figure (because she didn't wear a corset, so now has this feeling) is reflected in the body, healthy skin color and bumpy body, let her show a youthful breath. The healthy and sturdy body reveals a slender and delicate feeling that people can't help but want to care. This contradiction alone makes this girl have the conditions to attract any opposite sex. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, Big Brother, I am not interested in you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We raised your head The two eyes are facing Mingke's gaze. To tell the truth, there is an unimaginable attraction between men and women. Even if Wei, who is alive for the purpose of revenge for his loved ones, sees this girl feels a sigh. But Wei immediately returned to normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not your fault. A girl is traveling. It is common to wear menswear. It is not necessary to apologize." Wei turned his eyes away. , in sign language to express Mink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mingke sat down beside Wei, it’s really weird, Ming Ke could still sleep on this man without any scruples, but now Even sitting next to him will give her a sense of inexplicable tension. Mingke doesn't know what to do now. She never thought that she would be so nervous with Wei, thinking that Wei might (not possible, is certain) seeing her own bathing scene, her face began to appear a blush, but fortunately Wei did not pay attention to her face changes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei maintains his most comfortable sitting position, just this girl reminds him of the past. The love affair in the past, the relationship that caused all the bad consequences. (In fact, it is not a relationship, even single-hearted thoughts are probably not counted, just unilaterally admiring a woman.) Wei used to be the secret object of all the young girls in the vicinity of several tribes (handsome and strong, indeed A good object), he has also been exposed to several girls, but Mink gives him a feeling similar to that of a love that has never started. With this girl, I will remember the fragile and sensitive nerves in my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time spent quietly in the silence of two people, the evening has passed, and the night is coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distance from the oasis is not as far as you think, in the end The green piece appeared, and everyone thought it was wrong. When they reached the edge of the oasis, they were very happy to find the horses they had stocked here. Under the nourishment of the water plants here, the horses became fat and strong, and they didn’t know when they arrived at the oasis. How many times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without a lot of effort, it’s easy for everyone to control the horse, the parcels on the horseback are still intact, and there are no other people since they left. Arrive at this oasis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When can the magician brother come back?" When everyone was sitting on the ground, Babe asked Behan. "Wait! He should be back soon!" Behan was very calm on the surface, but in fact he was a little uneasy in his heart. It was not an easy thing to get past the Orcs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think, we should have a personal post!" This resolution was quickly passed, and everyone decided to wait for two days in this oasis, and then Plan to do the next step. During this period, everyone will take turns to stand on a high ground outside the oasis to prevent accidents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the adventurer made this decision, a team of about five hundred orcs of the orcs were marching in the wilderness, their task was to search for this and there was no other Adventurer. However, because the direction is not well grasped, they have been staggered by a great distance from the adventurer. If you follow the current direction, the Orc can definitely not find the adventurer. The reason for this error is the wrong judgment of the half-orc. Since the adventurer was not found to be afraid to go to the oasis, the commander of the Orc did not regard the oasis as their search target. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 05<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold is really suffering now, in this unlucky wolf It is really uncomfortable. Now the gold can really understand the lazy of the legendary half-orc, even the poorly trained wolf is considered a wolf. The wolf that the Orc rides is a tall, strong, fierce animal. The wild wolf is called the wolf. After being domesticated, it is called the wolf. When gold watched the half-orc riding this animal, he never thought that riding this kind of beast was such a torture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician silently endures all this. As long as his magical power is restored, he has 100% confidence to destroy all the half-orcs together with these nasty wolves. As long as he flies into the sky, he can attack these without any. Half-orc with bow and arrow. He still doesn't understand why the Orcs didn't kill him. The half-orc is the most demon wizard. If any human magician falls into the hands of a half-orc, he does not need to pin his hopes on the compassion of the half-orcs. The Orcs always kill the captives in their hands with the cruelest way they can think of. In the war with humans, the habit of the half-orc has never changed, but this time, the book that gold is hard to get is actually different from the actual one. However, in any case, since the Orcs have committed this mistake, then Kim will try his best to use it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold’s heart does not actually see himself as a prisoner, the half-orc did not kill him on the spot, that is their first stupid, their escort They don't carry bows that can pose a threat to the magician. This is their second stupidity. As long as they kill these half-orcs, they can go back and meet with their partners. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although suffering from the bumps, the magic of the magician is gradually recovering. At the dawn of the next day, although the magicians are exhausted - they only Rested for half a night, but he has recovered a lot of magic - enough to destroy all these escorts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician quietly accumulates magic, he recites the mantra in the least noticeable voice, after noticing that his escorts are all unguarded, He suddenly raised his hand and pointed at the half-orc closest to him, and read out the "chain lightning" (this magic can send out a lightning that can attack another enemy and then attack another enemy, as long as the power of lightning does not disappear Will continue to attack the creature closest to it. The shortcoming of this magic is that the spell is long, consumes a lot of magic, and is easy to accidentally injure the comrades. The last few words of gold are concentrated on this magic. He believes that it can be eliminated. It’s not impossible to get rid of one and a half orcs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orc took a stunned prisoner who suddenly sounded. The captive suddenly sat up straight, pointed at them with his hands, and muttered in his mouth. Some strange words. They quickly learned what the magician was doing and every half-orc laughed. Kim surprised to look at his own hands, how is the spell useless? He immediately read one of the most commonly used short magics. "I called in the name of Ivlit, the god of fire, and called me to come and destroy everything in front of me." But, just as before, nothing happened, no. It should have been - the arrow of inflammation appeared from the hands of Kim. The half-orc laughed even more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whip rushed over to the magician with a huge whistling, the gold did not catch up, was hit by a whip, the force on the whip was strong, the gold was beaten Falling off the wolf's back. The other half-orcs came down from the wolf's back after laughing, and they came to Kim's side before Kim had come and stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fist and toe fall like rain to the unfortunate magician, he can’t stand up, the half-orc wants to give a lesson to this captive who tries to resist There is no room left under their fists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orc always stopped working when he was tired, and the bloody magician barely stood up from the ground, though every bruise on his body. They are all suffering from severe pain, but Jin Ning is not willing to show weakness in front of the half-orcs. He glared at the half-orcs in front of him. At this time, the leader of the half-orc, the half-orc who took the gold to the wolf, went to the opposite side of Kim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tall half-orc pulled out the knife hanging in his waist, and the weapon in his hand was placed on the shoulder of the magician, and then the half-orc was not mixed. The voice of the clear - the half-orc was only clear when talking about the lingua franca - it was a big call to Kim, but the two ears that Kim was beaten were squeaking, and he could not hear this half. What the orcs are saying. The magician even stood very reluctantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold looked at the shining sword with his eyes, the eyelids of his two eyes were swollen, so although I couldn’t hear clearly, but half The orc wants to express what anyone can see. He is warning the magician not to try to escape. Indeed, Kim can't escape now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Isn't you here yet?" Lev asked to be back from the position of standing guard Babe - because the little girl insisted on standing in the post, so everyone had to arrange for her to stand for an hour during the day - it was already a night, but Kim still had no shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
