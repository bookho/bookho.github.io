			<div id="content">As the phantom gradually approached, the magician considered the countermeasures in his stomach while retreating. Nubis said that he has lost control of this illusion, but all the actions of these phantoms should be arranged from the beginning, so there should be no derailed action. Maybe as long as you can see the true intention of this phantom, then this illusion may end. But I don't want to do what I can do. The more I panic in my heart, the more I can't see anything. Kim tried hard to adjust her breathing and wanted to calm herself down, but this effort failed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mirage finally stopped, he made a strange move - he raised a hand and put it in front of him and looked at it, he immediately sent out A cry of surprise, then looked up and saw the magician in front of him, Kim can clearly see the incredible expression on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gold?" He sent out a very happy, very enthusiastic, and unbelievable voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come on!" Kim knows that he has to start the classic process again - first, happy to shake hands or hug, then idle for a while, In the end, I’m going to do it with a little bit of inattention in gold – it seems that this time is no exception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ken ran over, the magician did not retreat, just watching each other's actions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can still see you? Haha..." Ken touched his cheek and touched Kim's cheek, seeming to confirm anything. "Sure enough, it is a dream. I can dream of your stupid look. It’s really rare... Hahaha... I mean, how can I die like this? Like me, I have great ambition and noble sentiment. Young... I am a little embarrassed... forget it, it doesn't matter, it's just a dream, and I can dream of gold... If I really met Kim and he talked like this, I have no face to see him again..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it feels a bit strange, but this phantom move is not beyond the scope of the previous series of tests, so the magician is still very alert, as long as they do not reveal flaws, then This phantom will not make any dangerous moves, as long as it is dragged to Nubis to restore control of this illusion, he is safe. For the above reasons, the magician is not relaxed at all, whether it is an action expression or a vigilance. On the one hand, he looked at the performance of this phantom, on the one hand, trying hard to find a place different from his real one from him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to be to verify that he is in a dream, willing to look at his body first, then squeezed his thigh, then he laughs "It doesn't hurt at all, it's a dream! But in the dream, I am sure that I am dreaming or for the first time! Hahaha..." He looks very happy, a kind of relieved happiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey? Why don’t you talk? Right, this is a dream. The things in the dream are really different from the real ones, right, even in reality. In the middle, since you became a magician, you don’t really like to talk! Isn’t a magician learning to be silent? Do you know that your father’s anger is the last time you didn’t say goodbye? I fell ill and lay in bed for three days. If he only has one of your sons, I am worried that he might be so mad. Fortunately, you still have brothers, brothers who are much more obedient than you... cough, speak up You are still a filial son, although you have the road you want to go! This is better than me, I will not give up the road that others have arranged... I am talking nonsense, this is my dream!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold’s heart is constantly increasing, although he left home and traveled with Lev, he did not think about his father, but he did not expect it. Going to the stubborn father will get sick. Nubis said that the phantom is based on some of the inner memory of his heart, coupled with some of the requirements of the illusionist, and that the phantom said something that he had never thought of, can you say... ...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nubus’s cockroaches rang again in the heart of Kim "must believe that these are fake...", yes, I am now in illusion Inside, the real Ken can't come to the Undead Island and get into this illusion. This is just a phantom. Maybe something in my heart is not aware of myself! Thinking of this, Kim couldn't help but fight a chill, and I actually hope that my father is sick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hurry up and wake up, I hope that when I wake up, I am seriously injured in the tent but will not leave sequelae. In this case, the King’s Majesty I will not give me any punishment for this defeat... Although it will be difficult to promote in the future..." Ken will no longer pay attention to this magician who is standing still and staring at his face. Look up and talk to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold has almost produced an impulse to speak, but reason tells him that this is just a phantom to lure the enemy, he controls himself, still does not relax his vigilance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kim didn't open his mouth, and he didn't change at all, but his faintly sensible walls began to crack. There is an unpredictable hunch in his heart, but he cannot grasp it in detail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Forget it, even if it's a dream, it's a long time to talk to you alone." This phantom made Out of the way - he actually sat down! This is unprecedented! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sit!" Ken shot the open space around him. "Oh, don't you sit? Right, you are only part of the dream, not the real gold! ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ken’s words stopped, because he saw Kim also sat down, and Kim chose a very suitable position to sit down carefully and sit. This position, no matter what action the phantom has, can't escape the sight of the magician's vigilance, there should be no problem! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gold! Do you know? When I came back from Warrior College, I found out that you haven’t come back yet, how lucky I am! Maybe I am selfish, but You have to know that on my way home, I have been praying to the gods that you have not yet married Mimi!... Haha! Now think about it, this is probably not the merit of the gods, because you become a magician, and God is better than me. It's close to a lot! But even if I come back earlier than you, I still don't have confidence, until I put the ring on her hand, I just started looking forward to you coming back... You will laugh at me, hate me? It doesn't matter, it really is In this way, although we have always grown up together, but...how to say, I have always been very selfish! I am such a person. But you are different, you are an open-minded person, happy to laugh, angry and angry When you are sad and frustrated, you will shut yourself in the room... I sometimes envy you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold feels shocked at the moment Unbeatable, though Keep reminding him that all this is fake. He is only in a illusion, but there is a louder and louder voice in his heart, telling him that this is true, and this is the last time they met. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, I have made such a dream and said everything I dare not say. My heart is really comfortable, Kim, you know, I There is a sense of guilt when you meet..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don’t say it, it’s over, let it pass!" The magician hurriedly covered his mouth. If he was confused by this phantom and died here, it would be too embarrassing, no, no! Kim uses reason to defend against the impact of emotions and forcibly restores the state that was maintained from the beginning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ken looked at the magician, revealing a confused look, when the two people did not speak, the sky of the entire illusion suddenly became dim, blue sky and white clouds After sweeping away, there was a gray, and there were countless unknown, indescribable things in the crazy twist of Tianyu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician looked up at the sky and immediately turned his attention to Ken in front of him, and then he saw an incredible figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ken’s costumes have all disappeared, and he is now wearing a very high-end armor – the inner layer is a fine double-layered chain mail, outside Plus the metal scales, although much lighter than the body armor, but the defense is more than the same - but the real attraction of the magician is the huge wound on his body. Ken’s body was smashed by a huge weapon—it seemed to be a two-handed axe. Starting from the right shoulder, the wound continued to the center of the waist. This was a fatal wound, even if there was a dozen therapists. No use! This kind of wound can't be seen in a living person! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gold!" Ken also noticed the changes in his body. He looked at his broken body and said in an indescribable voice, the tone inside. It contains too many things, as if it is a combination of a person’s life experience. “I am dead! It turns out that I am really dead... Hahaha... I remembered, I am really dead, just now. That's not a dream! Although I really hope it is a dream! Wait a minute, I am dead, you? Kim, are you dead?" He gave a nearly hysterical laugh, but it was sadr than crying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This... What is this?" Kim has not recovered from the surprise, and reason is constantly reminding that this may be a The trap, so he guarded and didn't relax. "I didn't die. Now we are in a illusion... What happened, how did you die?... No, why are you here?... What happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are not dead, are you still alive?!" Ken found the answer he cares most from the words of Kim, his face relaxed. He looked up to the sky. "Thank God, you have only hit me at least! And give me a chance to talk to my most important friend that I have always wanted to say without saying anything!" Then he will face his face to the magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ken, what's wrong? How can you die? Raftwar has no war..." But the magician said half of it remembered the war between the Leite Empire and the Red Alliance - maybe Raftwar may be involved in it. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the plains of Mazzaro..." Ken’s words have not been finished yet, and his body is suddenly black, like a real smoke - at least it looks like Smoke - surrounded, his body was lifted up, rising to the sky, willing to struggle, but useless, his vain twisting can not change this situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician looked at Ken’s eyes, then he rushed over and grabbed Ken, this is true Ken, not wrong, just as he is himself The same can not be wrong, if this is a trap arranged in the illusion, then Jin Ning can be poked by this phantom for a hundred knives and then stepped under the foot a hundred times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the black mist seems to have a power, and the fog forcefully bounces the magician’s hand that belongs to the creature, let him fall, but will continue to The sky goes up. The magician tried the magic again in vain, but in this world of illusion, he could do nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gold, Mi Mi..." But Ken’s last words have not been finished, his body is completely integrated with the sky, the chaotic sky looks It seems to be very high, but it seems to be very short, and it has risen to the top so quickly. The magician wanted to hear his words, but the rest of the voice was swallowed by this Tianyu ruthlessly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ken!" Kim tried his best to scream, but the sky was still cold and there was no answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surrounding scenery is restored to the real world, and there is a voice in the ear. The sound of Biss's resounding voice "has finally recovered. Fortunately, you have nothing to do. I really don't know what happened! Forget it, let's take a break today, let me check it out exactly where the error occurred."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing is wrong!" Kim said with a calm voice that he himself was amazed and never said, "Try again, I think, this exercise only Just do it again!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wolf walked out of the room, at When he walked out of the door, he felt a little supportless, leaning against the wall at the door, not because of physical fatigue, although his ceremony had lasted for nearly ten days. But the Necromancers do not have the concept of fatigue, they will only have the feeling of "emptiness" because of the consumption of magic. Although this ritual has been going on for such a long time, Wolf, who is the ceremonial host, does not consume much magic. Most of the time is waiting for the gathering of power. In fact, the time that really needs Woffer is very short. Everything went smoothly and he felt incredible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything is over, and your mission, which you knew when you became a Necromancer, is now over. In the room behind him, the result of the mission has already It is there. The reason why Wolf wanted to be a necromancer was indeed for Babe, but he knew the truth when he became a necromancer, and he directly told him the truth. At that time, he knew that he was in an irreversible trend, and that adapting to the trend was the only choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What will happen now? What happens if a person has completed what he has to do and ends the meaning of his existence? Wolf has had a speculation on this point, and now is the opportunity to verify this speculation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Babe is a summoner?!" To be honest, when I heard the words of those who sent Babe back, I was scared. One jump, how did this daughter become a summoner? From head to toe, Babe has not received any training related to the summoner, and there is no such knowledge at all. If this can become a summoner, then the summoner is too embarrassed. However, if you think about it carefully, it is not unreasonable for Babe to become a summoner. What the summoner needs is the ability to communicate with the creatures living in the upper and lower levels, and for some reason or for some kind of use. The method allows these creatures to obey their own skills. All the knowledge or training of the summoner is to achieve this goal, and these two points are what Babe is born with. With the power of Pluto, Babe can extend consciousness to every high and low level world, and creatures living in those places can't resist the call of Pluto. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great will that has just arrived at this temple has left, and now everything has returned to calm, even though the door is separated, Wolf can feel that the room is now It’s calm, it seems that everything has never happened. If you only see the present, who can imagine that there is a god directly in this room? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon, the energy formed a passage, and a tall figure appeared in Wolf's line of sight. Like the first time, the figure was still wearing a black robe, and it did not change at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face-to-face confrontation with Wolff, both of them remain silent, but in the end there are still people who broke this situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know why I am coming?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course, but I still have to say You are late! Forget it, it is like this, you should come over this time!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am late?" Surprisingly, the calmness of the opponent made him feel a little uneasy. "I was going to come earlier, but I was a little late to get something. But it doesn't matter, it's not too late, at least I don't think so. Late!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, if I delay two days, you will delay for another two days, this is the case, isn't it?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Supreme paused, it seems that he could not understand the meaning of Wolff’s words, so the discussion was inconclusive, so he turned a topic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why betray me, Wolf?" There is a cruelty in the tone, indicating that the Sayādaw is only calm, but he is actually quite angry now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What betrayed? You are not a king, I am not your courtier. We only have a relationship of cooperation and mutual use. Where can we be called? For betrayal!" The smile on Wolf's mouth is getting stronger and stronger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Think about it, who let you get rid of the fate of sickness and death, and let you become the leader of the Necromancer? Is it really like what others say? Is human being a creature that doesn't know how to be grateful? Although I know that human beings are full of hatred, jealousy, conspiracy and killing, how many good factors exist?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey! It’s so nice to say, pretend to be a saint!" Wolf gave a disdainful laughter from his nose. "Do you think that I have been white for years? You helped me become Is the Necromancer for me? You just want to use my power to control the Necromancer and serve your plan! The members of the Management Council of the Necromancer can only be zombie mage, and in the Undead War, all zombie mage They are all dead, so you only need to create a zombie mage, and all the necromancers will be under your control! Hahaha... It’s a good plan, but it’s a pity to pick a wrong candidate – I’m right No?”<br /><br />& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Even if I have this selfishness, but the Dark Holy Grail is always brought back to you! Think about it, Wolf, with this artifact, you can gather it, human beings from the world. If you don't have this thing, you will never be able to launch the war of revenge. You can only hide on this island and curse humans while lamenting your incompetence!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your kindness! However, for this artifact, I also paid you enough, a full 10,000 Dark Knight! I think, at this point, we have not owed each other. If you think that this sale is not worthwhile, then I am willing to use the Dark Grail to exchange those dark knights that you have borrowed - but this artifact is only a waste in your hands, only the Necromancer can use his power! Right? This is the true intention of giving the Holy Grail to us!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a series of energy fluctuations around the sage, caused by anger fluctuation. But the fluctuations then disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think, I did choose the wrong candidate. Let me make up for this mistake now, everything is too late!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it right? Yes, it's still too late!" Wolf's posture has not changed at all, but when the voice landed, his power broke out. Suddenly, the power of a space surrounded the two bodies, the speed was so fast, even the sages did not have time to react, and the two came to a new place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a light, the Lord and Wolf are now in a corridor surrounded by light, an air corridor with no slings, below Without pillars, it was so empty in the air, and the entire corridor was full of beautiful carvings. This is simply another world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What a fun thing? Opening a crack in a different space, and combining the different space with the perfect world is really amazing creativity! How do you do it? It is not difficult to combine the alien space with the world, but it needs a lot of energy to maintain! I don't think you can afford this consumption!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;The tone of two people is as easy as the chat between ordinary guests and guests, but they are both alert. Both sides know that the conflict is inevitable, and the battle is only a matter of time sooner or later! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sayādaw ended the action of looking around and then turned his face to face the Necromancer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have already had this plan long ago? Wolf, it’s a pity to destroy you. In fact, we don’t have to do this. We have The common enemy human beings, we don't have to kill each other, I can't have happened as a thing of the past..." The honorable person put on a tone and wanted a reconciliation tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And then you can get more Dark Knights? Didn't I say that, don't say good things, pretend to be a saint!" Wolff interrupted the words of the Sayādaw, and his face still maintains that kind of mocking smile. "It's a pity that human beings are not the enemy of the necromancer. I used to be, now, and in the future, human beings, the necromancer is just a branch of humanity. However, even if there is a contradiction between the branch and the trunk, the connection between them cannot be cut off. You don't even understand this. You are still one of the devils!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "It seems that you know a lot, even beyond my expectations!" The tone of the Sayādaw has recovered, and perhaps it has not changed, even if there is change, it is installed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I also know that it is not easy for you to destroy me! In fact, I think who is destroying who might not!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes? I will let you know that what you know is not all right!" After that, the Sayādaw extended a hand, opposite him. The Necromancer also raised his hands at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conflict between power and power has come to an end, this corridor is full It was destroyed by two-thirds. The Sayādaw is still standing there, his hand has been put down. On the opposite side of him, only the floor of the corridor was left, and the rubble of the ceiling was piled on the floor. The rubble began to move, and then Wolf came out from the top of the rubble. His black robe showed a lot of torn places, and it was obvious that he suffered a loss in the first round. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is it possible? Why can you use magic?" The Necromancer sent an incredible voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are very smart, but not enough!" The sage answered slowly. "You have chosen a very suitable battlefield because of the life of this space." The body is at your disposal, so you can control the laws of this space. You have just banned all the power except Pluto, but it is useless to me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Impossible, as long as there is space in this space, the law is useful. Since you are in this space, you can't use all the magic except Pluto!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, so I just used the Pluto Method!" The Sayādaw looked at the look of the undead wizard in front of him and sent a very useful laugh. "Ha ha ha... Haven't you seen this spell? Of course, Because this is what I invented! Don't make this look look like, don't you know a lot?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The so-called magic, in the final analysis, is the power of using the elves, regardless of What magic is just the power of the elves and how to use the power of the elves. Although the Phantom Law is mysterious, it is only the power of the Elves!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Emerald?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't know? After all, it's just a shallow human being! It's really funny, you can use power. But I don't know the source of power! It's no wonder that the Elves are a special kind of elf. It is neither a simple elemental elf like a squalor, nor a simple spiritual elf like love and hate. It is a special existence, both material and spiritual. This is also the root cause of the power of the Pluto. I tell you this, it is a gift for you, of course, forever saying goodbye!" At the end of the sound, although there is no change in the movement of the Sayādaw, Wolf immediately knew that the next wave of attacks was coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright went into Wolf’s room and didn’t hide himself the meaning of. After all, staying on Undead Island for a while, Brett already knew the habits of the Necromancer. Probably because of the small number, the Necromancers each have their own area of ​​activity. There is only Wolf and a ghost mage in this area. The ghost mage has already given the damn gold and his companions the annihilation, and Wolf is now being dealt with by the sages. There will be no other disturbers here. It's time to find something good - there are a lot of good things that have been handed down from the hands of the Necromancer, just like the magical crystal ball that was broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is this?" Brett said to himself, looking at the portrait. The woman inside is quite beautiful, and who is a bit like - right, that little girl, the little girl with Kim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dedicated to the favorite Kira" Brett turned this small portrait over and saw the line. He immediately understood the identity of this woman, this woman should be the wife of Wolf or humans (the Sayādaw once told him some things about Wolf's past). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can rest now, because your husband will come with you soon!" Brit's evil smile, he did not find The hatred of valuable items was vented to the painting. He read a small spell. Soon, the flames were swelled on the painting, the fire tongue was filled with the canvas, and the entire lower end of the canvas was quickly swallowed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright put the burning canvas on the ground, then turned and left, and did not forget to force the door closed when he walked out of the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame is extinguished, and the original portrait now has only a few ash and a small spot that has not burned. & Nbsp;; & nbsp; & nbsp; <br <br /> & nbsp /> & nbsp;; & nbsp; & nbsp; ...... <br <br /> & nbsp /> entire corridor has become a very fine fell into a different space bottomless In the abyss, both of them used the power of magic to float in the air. The sorcerer’s attack was very fierce. If Wolf is not a necromancer, he is now dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that I still can't fight against fate!" Wolf said to himself with what he could only hear, "Although I made a lot of preparations, Still failed, has completed the mission of existence or there is no need to exist!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything is over, in the battle just now, Wolf has I tried my best, but the Sayādaw seemed to be a good-looking one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that your level is only like this!" Sayādaw spoke up. "I don't know if I overestimated you or you underestimated me, you Do you think that making a space trap can deal with me? You also know that I am one of the devils - although this is the name that others have given me - do you think that such a small trick can defeat me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No! I thought from the beginning that I didn't have much hope of victory. I just did my best, even though I know that this effort is mostly in vain!" br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "? Oh," now turn to His Holiness expressed surprise, "the fight is also not sure why?" <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't need to know!" Wolf smiled at the saint in front of him. "However, I have not been completely defeated, I still have a trick!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tricks? Interesting, try it? Let me see what you call the trick. What is it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“My trick is this, the most powerful spell invented by humans! The most powerful force born of the endless abyss, by us The connection of blood calls you here, born of all things, and destroys the ultimate power of all things, and now shows your true form in front of me..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Stupid! The law of this space is what you stipulate, you can only use the Pluto method!" The sage did not stop Wolf's long spell, because he can also distinguish that the spell is not the Phantom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Because the beginning is also at the end! You are wrong, honor, this curse is an exception, he is not subject to the rules of space, pick up "The eternal robbery!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spell is finished, some light particles appear in front of Wolf, and then quickly separate and increase, in a very short time Inside, the entire space is filled with particles of these tiny lights, and the Lord and Wolf are surrounded by particles of these lights. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "! What is this, as escape cover a good one." Although the lips is very easy, but His Holiness felt something wrong in order to prevent the upcoming On the offensive, he secretly vented his temper to protect himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the greatest collection of all the dark sides of mankind, the most powerful magic generated when resentment reaches the limit, the eternal ravages of inflammation, the curse of the destruction of all things. Curse!" Wolf laughed, everything was done, and the sages could not stop it - no one could stop it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole temple shook a bit. It seemed that there was an invisible hand that dialed this huge building. Although it looked like a small one from the outside, it was a violent to the people in the temple. The vibration, Blatant climbed up three times in a row and fell three times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened?" Brett wanted to use the spirit to contact the sage, but the sage did not give him any signal of answer, which made him uneasy. The heart, he knows that something happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the lord defeated by Wolf?" A thought rose from the heart, but this is impossible, although Wolf is also strong, but the sage Being defeated, how is this possible? Brett stood up, he used magic to sense the source of this shock, and then quickly moved toward the goal, although other necromancers may also be there, but now can not manage so much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright is standing there with a stunned look, he remembers that there was a very The gorgeous air corridor - obviously the air corridor caused by magic, but now there is nothing left, there is nothing left, this passage is suddenly broken, the front is a huge, very uncoordinated circle The space seems to be a piece of the whole here. No one here, no Wool, no Sayādaw, no other necromancers - of course, for the last bit of Brett is very fortunate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is something, Brett notices that there is something floating in this circular sky, a glowing stone that seems to be a gem, but soon Brette felt the enormous energy released from the gem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gem began to float in the direction of Brett, and then Brette saw the changes that took place on the gem, something that was constantly coming from the gem Popping out, something that keeps creeping, getting faster and faster, and then Bright looks at these things to form a form, the outermost layer of that form slowly turns into cyan scales. Then other parts began to form slowly, and finally became a creature with a tail, limbs, head, and a lizard-like person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Supreme ???" Although I have never seen the true face of the sage, But Bright recognizes the true identity of this creature, probably Let's stay instinct together for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Awesome, actually can directly decompose the space into energy, it is really a curse in the curse, I am a coach. However, this still can not Destroy me!" The sorcerer ignored Breit on one side and sent himself a sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Walf, you have failed, now you have no protection, see how your subordinate will treat your daughter! You will definitely die, but I suspect that your daughter is so small, enough to be a sergeant! Hahaha..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Almost all the necromancers are here now, they all feel the terrible energy, and know that Wolf has been eliminated. Although almost all the necromancers do not agree with Wolf's practice, the rules are the rules, they must obey the council, and Wolf is the only member of the council. In a short period of time, two huge forces came in succession. The first time was the power of Pluto, and the second source could not be distinguished. The Necromancers didn't know what was going on, but the same uneasiness made them all gather together. Every Necromancer knows that there is no council now, so they exchange opinions and discuss what to do together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Supreme and Brett came to the door of the room where the ceremony was just held, cloth He wants to push the door, but the Supreme has stopped this movement. He sticks out his claws - this organ is more suitable than a hand rather than a claw - a small symbol is drawn on the door. Unlike Buhlet, he can feel the living body inside without opening the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The role of this thing is to bring the Necromancer." Sayādaw looked at Brett's incomprehensible look, "And then, what will the Necromancers do?" Dealing with Wolf's daughter? It's really exciting. Wolf, you want to use magic to cover up your daughter's life fluctuations, so that protecting your daughter after you disappear is really touching fatherly love, but I won't let you Successful. Hahaha... Let's go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Necromancers immediately concluded that since there were no special orders from the council, everything was done according to the rules, and the Undead Island did not allow the existence of a living person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A necromancer sent a spell, although it was a small spell, but it was enough to deal with this coma girl, a dazzling lightning shot, aiming directly at the altar On the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But what surprised the Necromancer was that the lightning was suddenly blocked by the power when it was close to Babe, disappeared into the air, and Babe stood up and sat up. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enormous power that emanates from the body of Babe is the power of pure death, belonging to the power of Pluto. It is clear that she is a living person, but the power of Pluto is emanating from her body. This power overwhelm all the necromancers and let the necromancer understand that there is a huge difference in rank between them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you going to do? My loyal servants?" Babe speaks in a voice that has never been seen before, and the voice should not belong to a small Girl's. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Necromancers have expressed their obedience, they can feel the will of Pluto from the body of Babe, this girl is the spokesperson of Pluto in this world, all have The creatures that fall into the category of death cannot resist her orders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The group has been in the cursed desert for several days, The husband once heard people say what the desert is and how ridiculous it is. The monsters are everywhere, but when they come here, they know that this is not the case. There are many oases in the desert caused by the magic of the Necromancer, which provides a stopover for the travellers passing through here. Not only that, there are many settled residents in this desert, and some oases have even formed cities, cities that are active by north-south traffic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the lost continent, the countries of the North and the Kingdom of Chirila in the south have quite close business contacts. Due to the influence of the sea trend, merchants generally sit from the north. The ship went to the south and then returned to the north from the south through the cursed desert. Due to the existence of this commercial passage, the cities in this desert were quite prosperous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four people are now traveling with a caravan. This is a very common thing. Originally, this desert is the existence of bandits and robbers who have been robbing homes, plus the current chaos. (The Leite Empire is playing with the Red Alliance, you have to live with each other, and countries have more or less mixed feet.) It is a matter of course for a caravan to hire a group of adventurers as bodyguards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere inside the team is quite dull. There are few words between each other. Since returning from Undead Island, this atmosphere has been maintained. Babe stayed on the Undead Island. This lively little girl is a stimulant of active atmosphere. Although everyone doesn't say anything, but they are really reluctant to have a feeling of loss, but this has a feeling of loss - but this There is also no way to do it. The magician will also stay on the Undead Island for a while, although he will meet them in the city of Delante, but the team also has one stimulant (beibei) and a reconciliation agent (gold), and the atmosphere is with them. This adventure is completely different when it starts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei sitting in front of the carriage, his expression has not changed in the past few days, just like the mask, although no one asked, but everyone looked at it. He has a very heavy heart now. Although he used to be silent, he did not go to this point. Besides speaking, eating, blinking, there is no muscle on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing?" The businessman sitting on the wagon of the carriage got to the side of Wei and sent a classic question. He is very careful now. Because this is the most insecure place nearby, according to the news, several robbers have been encountered here in the past few months, and many people have died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This caravan is small, fourteen merchants, twenty-seven bodyguards, a total of seven cars, from the merchants’ cautiousness and employment In the case of bodyguards with inconsistent quantities of goods, these tightly packed goods should be valuable and eager to get rid of them, otherwise they will wait a little longer to join a larger caravan. To increase security. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei Weiwei nodded and answered the answer - because of his armor, he was sitting in the carriage, while others were riding horses - nearby There should be nothing suspicious, although it is surrounded by rugged sand dunes, it is easy to hide something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everything goes well..." The old man muttered to himself. Suddenly, he noticed that Wei’s line of sight was in one direction. He also looked in that direction, a smoke was rising from that place, and something came over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thousands of Orcs appear in the vision of the magician, they have found The magician, rushing over to him, while running and making a vicious curse, can be seen from their faces, they have made up their minds to destroy this human being. In order not to use magic time for the magician, they are flying here at the fastest speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orcs are getting closer, but the magician is still motionless and does not release any magical expressions. He just looks at these half-orcs with a smile. Rush closer. The calm of the magician made the Orcs feel puzzled. When they were about 50 meters apart, they slowed down. They couldn't understand what the magician wanted to do. The Orcs began to approach slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold watched the Orc enter his intended range, then he raised his hands high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thunderstorms hidden in the dust, obey my orders, show your strength!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Just in front of the Orcs, the thunder suddenly burst out from the ground. In an instant, the gorgeous light formed a thunderbolt wall, blocking between the Orcs and the magician, and the Orcs were shocked by this scene. They stopped acting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A half-orc marched cautiously under the command of the leader, intending to put his weapon into the lightning wall to see if this continuous thunder is true or false. But these gorgeous electric lights made them look bad and couldn't see the magician's mouth moving at high speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the weapon reached into the thunderbolt, an energy penetrated the body of the half-orc, seemingly dragged by this half-orc, the lightning wall Some of the energy was shot in the middle of the Orcs, leaving behind a dozen blackened bodies after a panicked dodge and commotion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orc panicked back a distance, and when their leader finally controlled the commotion, the magician raised his hands again, another lightning wall from them left Sideways, and, began to move to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Right, circumnavigating from the right!!" The leader shouted with all his might, trying to control his panicked subordinates, but just before they started to the right During the exercise, the magician raised his hand again and a new lightning wall appeared on the right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader is afraid of himself, this magician is too powerful, how can they fight against such a powerful magician? Almost all the Orcs looked at their heads, and this leader was afraid because of his dignity, but he did not escape. He expected this to be the limit of the power of the magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold raised his hand again, another lightning wall emerged from behind the Orcs, this lightning wall moved forward at a faster rate, four lightning walls Form a square, as if to swallow the thousands of orcs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The will of the half-orc has collapsed, I don’t know who to start with, but very quickly, including the leader, all the orcs are running hard. Before the four lightning walls were encircled, they fled backwards from the gap. Even the smartest of them didn't think that they only died a dozen. How could such powerful magic only cause such a little killing? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I did it, Nubis, this is what I realized. When dealing with most enemies, you don't need to be strong, you only need the enemy to think of you. It's very powerful, just give them panic and let the individual consciousness go beyond the overall consciousness, they will run away!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do it well!" Disappeared, the Necromancer showed a rare smile in front of him. "Leverage the characteristics of the half-orc magic, and use the enhanced illumination to pretend to be a lightning bolt. Although it took a little risk, it still did very well. That person Sure enough, I didn’t read it wrong...” The happiness was excessive, and it was too late to say that the export was recovered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The person???"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, nothing! I talked casually, Don't worry! I am here today! Today, although you are doing very well, there will be more tests tomorrow! Let's rest first. I noticed that you have not rested these days!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bright, I remember you are the people of the Reiter Empire?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Supreme, yes, my family is the most recent in the history of the Reiter Empire. One of the long-standing aristocrats..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you want to go home?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"? ??"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In any case, now you don't need to stay on Undead Island, it's better to go back!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Supreme..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I noticed that you have not completely digested the power of that memory crystal, and now is a good opportunity. I want you to stay with that Victor... Do you understand what I mean?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brighte breathed a sigh of relief, he just misunderstood The meaning of the Sayādaw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take this box and bring him to the Victor Emperor... Let that York come to see you, remember, you must not A person opens the box, I believe that you will not violate my order, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes! Lord!" Brette took the box. "Do I have to leave now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes! Immediately!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Human still wants Controlling with humans!" Sayādaw looked at Brett's back and thought that his magician's role was much smaller than he thought. It can be said that it is a failure to use that kind of to monitor human beings. The practice is still alive, and human beings with their own ideas are suitable for surveillance. Is it necessary to call that roar back now? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Forget it!" The Supreme finally dismissed the idea. "It’s just an experiment, it doesn’t matter! Just give it to the disobedient kid. Use it!" While thinking, he walked towards the side of a body wrapped in a complete armor. He reached out and touched the armor. "In any case, it's just an experiment to make you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sky is already dark, but the magician feels that he is not sleepy, although he has been undergoing intense training every day for several days. Whenever he closes his eyes, Kim always thinks of the sky in his mind. The sky, made up of countless indescribable things, is swallowed by the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no direct evidence, but Kim knows that this time he finally met with this friend who had been together since childhood, that kind of thing cannot be The heart from him is brought by the power outside. When he was young, Ken was always interested in guns and admired the legends of heroes. Like other teenagers who were immersed in similar dreams, he hoped that he would make a career in the future, create a new hero legend, and even hope that he can The war died on the battlefield. Perhaps for a knight, war is not a terrible thing, but a supreme honor, because the real harm of death is the relatives and friends of the deceased, not the deceased itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bed of Nobis is much worse than the bed in the Temple of Pluto. It is not good to sleep on the top of the temple. After convincing that he just can’t sleep for this reason. Kim climbed up and came outside the house, staring at the starlight, and saw that the necromancer was sitting on a stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is he still not sleeping? When this question appeared, he was answered by Kim himself. Nubis is a necromancer who does not need sleep at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, Kim? Can't you sleep?" The Necromancer also found the gold coming out of the house. He smiled. "Sleep is very valuable. Like me, even if I want to sleep, there is no way to fall asleep! The lost things, no matter what, are valuable!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Biss!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you looking for something to do with me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!" With this answer, the two people fell silent, and the necromancer waited for the blonde to ask, but Kim couldn’t remember what to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right," Kim finally remembered a topic. "I want to know what the elemental covenant is. I have heard this from someone else, as if Is a way to immunize magic..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is the war between humans and high-level goblins?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, you know, it’s a tough war, one can only use a reluctant victory. Describe the war... Do you know why the high-level goblins are so powerful? A large part is the technique in which the high-level goblins have elemental covenants, and almost all magic is weakened..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Wait a minute, is it true that the elemental covenant was invented by the high-level goblins..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It can be said that human magic originated from higher fairies, but In the long time, before the war, a complete and rigorous system was developed, and various powerful magic spells were developed, but in any case, the human master did not have the power to directly compete with the higher goblins. The key to this is the elemental covenant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know, all the magic, in the final analysis, is the use of the power of the elves to form the world. Various elves. high fairies The law is called elf magic by humans, because they don't need to use spells, they can directly deal with the elves, and the high goblins can use magic to generate magic, so they can combine weapons and magic perfectly. Do you understand? To make up for the gaps created by weapons, the power of the combination is very big. If there is a single soldier fighting in front, there is no chance for victory for human beings, whether it is a warrior or a magician. This kind of magic is fast and powerful. But there is also a weakness, that is, there is no change. If you have fought with ten high-level goblins, you have seen all their magic. If their magic is as much as humans, maybe we will There is no chance of rebellion, no magic of spells, do you know? How many powerful mages die without their chance of using magic, and even my two brothers are defeated like this... The elements of high leprechaun The covenant is an extension of the elf magic. The principle is very simple, that is, the same element is not Mutual exclusion!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The fire won't burn, the wind won't tear the wind, the ice won't freeze the ice, just let the elves identify themselves as they are, The power of the elf will not be added to you. You know that the power of the elf cannot be applied to the elves of the same kind. Therefore, as long as you pretend to be a fire, the fire magic will be ineffective against you, disguising yourself as a wind, and attacking the wind. You have no effect."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But how is that possible?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Possible, This can be done, even for humans. However, the elemental covenant is not absolute. When disguised as a fire, it cannot be disguised as a wind. If you are attacked by magic of different attributes in the same time, you still have to be hurt. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But, I saw that the Orcs had an elemental covenant? They will never use any elf magic..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Orc's elemental covenant is different, that is the power of God of War. A firm belief can make the power of God of War come into play, and use the power of the spirit to fight against the elves of the element, but as long as they add the power they can't load, they can't bear it. Unfortunately, if you want to reach this level, it is not an ordinary magician. Do it. Although there are differences, there are things in common against magic. Therefore, both are called elemental covenants. At least we humans call them this way. "Nubs sighed. "Now the Orcs have re-discovered the hammer of the god of war, and the new king of teeth has also been recognized by the priest of God of War." You look at it, you don't have much time, the half-orc's priests of the gods will increase a lot, and then they will re-create the terrible mad beasts, a horrible corps that is mostly ineffective. I don't know if human beings can pass this test. It is impossible for a country in the north to rely on the Dicko country to resist this threat... Well, these have nothing to do with you, and they are issues that the authorities in power should consider. "Nubis, you just said, your brother... I remember that after the War of Liberation, humans did not have any conflict with the high-level goblins, then you ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes! Nubis smiled, and then said with a very proud look, "I am Nubis, the illusionist Nobis, one of the captains of the Magic Corps in the Liberation War, I am the Holy Light." The fourth disciple is also the world's first necromancer! I am also the lord of Pluto Island! One of the builders of the Pluto Temple! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The disciple of the Holy Light? ? ? ! ! ! "In an instant, it seems that there is a thunder and lightning that has shot into the body of Kim. His body is bouncing up because of this surprise. "The holy light..." Gold stammered, "The world is the most powerful." The magician, who led the human race to defeat the high spirits... that...the light? ? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
