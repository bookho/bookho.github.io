			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the Thousand Lakes City to the south, through a narrow desert, it entered another plain. The cursed desert that was created by the magic of the Necromancers seems to have gradually lost its vitality because of the demise of the Necromancers. The desert has been shrinking, and abundant rain has caused many rivers to invade the desert, gradually transforming this ridiculous place into a rich land of water and grass. The desert, which used to take tens of days to climb, can now be crossed in only ten days. Some areas only take five days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty powerful wizards are on the plain. Unlike the North, there is only one external threat to this land – the Wings. However, the threat of the Winged people has not yet brought the benefits they bring. Because the inside of the winged people is a group of loose sands, this race has never formed a unified kingdom since humans were adjacent to them. They have fewer people, so the expansion is not strong. Only by chance, several Winged tribes will form alliances and launch a predatory invasion of humanity. This kind of invasion is easy to be blocked by the wizard king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No external troubles often mean internal problems. The competition with the Wizarding King is also very fierce, and they are intriguing each other. The conflict of force is one after another. Infiltration and invasion are even more commonplace. Although the power of the wizard king is unfathomable, their opponents are also the same wizard king, so it is not uncommon for the wizard king to be defeated and the rule of subversion. For two hundred years of the jungle, only the most powerful and embarrassing wizard kings remain in this land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The front is the desert city, the first big city to the south of the road. It belongs to the governor of the Wang Feiyan family."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The businessman who drove the car enthusiastically introduced. This small caravan (just two people) was accompanied by a group of people in the desert. This small caravan consists of a middle-aged father and a young son, who rely on the two to transport supplies to the desert and serve as a guide to make a living. Their livelihood tools are three big cars and a few rare beasts. This huge, docile magical animal is invaluable for desert transportation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Family? The wizard king is now also a family?" Jin could not help but ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, guest, are you northerners? No wonder I don't know." That father answered with a smile. “A lot of people from the North have been so surprised to ask.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But even if it’s a blood relative, once you have your own strength, it’s hard to shake it. In this case, it can be regarded as an independent wizard king rather than a family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wrong." The night wind inserted a sentence. "The wizard king in this area has a spell that can be used to motivate others. It can be granted or retracted at will. So there is only one real wizard king, the other is an agent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turned out to be like this..." Jin Shen stunned. This technique does exist - but can the incomplete Wraith Tower use this magic? After all, the wizard king is a human being, and the magic of the grievance tower belongs to the Pluto law that is difficult for the mortal to control. Therefore, the grievance tower made by the general wizard king is incomplete. If you use this kind of magic, then the incomplete grievance tower may not be able to bear... it is easy to collapse...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a way, gold." It seems to have guessed the doubts in Jin Xin. "It's okay to make new grievance towers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Guests, if you have never been here before, I suggest you be careful in the future. The wars are very frequent, and it is miserable to get involved in the battle a little bit. So the first thing before you travel is to inquire about the news, don't go through those areas where the atmosphere is tense."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "But why do you need an agent to rule?" Xina raised a new question. "I heard that the magic of the wizard king allowed him to monitor his entire territory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the limitation of mankind." On the shoulder, explained in a self-deprecating tone. "It can't be seen to see. For example, we can see the action of any ant at the ant's nest. But at the same time, we can't notice the actions of all the ants. Similarly, he can see any place he wants to see, but he can only pay attention to one place at a time. If the territory of the wizard king is large, he can't really grasp everything."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And the opponent of the wizard king is also the wizard king. They will have a way to deal with this disadvantage." No month inserted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Feiyan family..." Jin looked at the outline of the town that appeared on the other side of the horizon. Although it is already in the field of vision, experienced people know that it takes another day to actually reach that city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, the Feiyan family, the land under their rule is known for creating more teachers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Creator? Are those who make magic tools?" asked the night wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. This is the only magic user that the Wizarding King can tolerate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "The user of the magic of power. Once fell, but was revived because of the rise of the wizard king." Wu cone smiled and said to Kim. Gold turned his head and looked a little unhappy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Jin... What happened to him?" Xina asked the black cone on her shoulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do not get in the way, just think of some unpleasant things. It will soon return to normal." Wu cone replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The journey of this time made further understanding between these four people. The nature of these four birds is extremely complementary to some extent. So this journey is not lonely. Kim is not a curious person. He has never asked anyone else's origins in one sentence. Of course, no matter whether it is no moon or even an eve, I have never asked Kim. Even if you ask, the answer is just an "ordinary traveler". In terms of routes, although their goals are consistently southward. But the goal of Kim is the southern plateau, and no moon understands that he will break up in the middle and gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I came to the South to learn a technique." This is the answer without a month. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold began to chat with the middle-aged businessman without a sentence. The five of them were sitting in the first car, and the son who was the son was sitting in the last car. The businessman was very kind. He kept telling Kim about the situation and selling his goods without losing the opportunity - there were many small jewellery for women in his car. As a businessman, he is well versed in the techniques of observing and watching. Since these three women are traveling with this man, there should be a common relationship. But the night wind is a winged man - although mixed race is not impossible, but at least not accepted by most people - and wearing armor with weapons; no moon is a dumb inaccessible look, the only possibility left It’s just an eve – although it’s a little younger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, after repeatedly stressing how beautifully the accessories are worth, the businessman finally turned the topic to the core position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why didn't Mr. Jin buy a little girlfriend for you? It's hard to have such a young and lovely girlfriend." The businessman pointed at Xi Na. Kim said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a smooth progress for the businessman after repeated suggestion, and for the gold that is absent-minded and has never considered this issue, It was just as scary as a blue sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah...this..." Jin Zhangkou, but for a moment did not know how to answer. It is very clear that all the people, including the black cone, have heard it. Xina’s face was red and it’s red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said the boss," the black cone flew back to Kim’s shoulder. "Actually, their relationship is not what you think." It sees the golden shackles, so Come help him out. "We just travel together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, haha, is it, Mr. Crow...hahaha..." The businessman was also well-behaved and immediately Kim’s reaction knows that he is wrong. His business plan naturally fell short. This made him inevitably a little lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it was dark, a group of people camped in an open place on the edge of the desert. Although it is barely deserted here, there are already weeds growing. As mentioned earlier, this desert is gradually being eliminated over time. For this reason, there is no horrible World of Warcraft in this desert, and poisonous insects such as snakes and scorpions are rare. As long as you don't get lost, this desert is basically safe. It is the existence of this desert that the northern wizard king could not extend the power to the south, and the southern wizard king could not go north. The desert became an isolation zone, turning the south into a relatively independent sphere of influence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yu Na's craftsmanship is really great!" The black cone was greatly praised while drinking soup from a small bowl. "Whoever is with you is a blessing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
