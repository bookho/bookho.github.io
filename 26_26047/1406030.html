			<div id="content">The Thunderbolt sword forced the Golden Festival to retreat, and several times almost slammed the sword. Fortunately, there was a newly created grievance tower as a shield, and Kim finally had a round of pounces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I said, I am saving him. I will reverse the spell and let him out." Kim shouted in the gap. But the ice blue is like nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The sorcerer is damn!" She slashed her sword again, this time Kim did not dodge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lightning sword left a blue mark in the air, and then was caught by a welcoming hand. Ice blue immediately spurred the power of the sword, and the arc flashed on the sword and rushed from the hilt to the tip of the sword like a wave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is it possible?" Ice Blue did not believe in the situation at hand. Kim grabbed the sword with one hand and pinched tightly. However, the lightning wave flashing on the sword did not hurt him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it because of the grievance tower? No, there is still a lack of necessary ceremonies... Now the wizard can't draw strength from the Tower of Wraith. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ice Blue further spurred the power of the sword, and the whole lightning bolt began to tremble slightly. A line of electric light kept coming out of the sword, like a golden snake. However, this wizard who claimed to be gold did not suffer any harm at all. His hand seemed to have an invisible wall that blocked the power of all lightning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Continue to force... until it exceeds the tolerance of this sword, let it become a pile of scrap iron!" Gold looked coldly at the opponent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is it possible...you are clear in the morning..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Between serious and not serious The difference is very big, little girl!" Kim's hand slammed, and the ice blue was caught in the lightning sword for a moment of surprise. He pushed the other hand and pushed the ice and blue back a few steps. The last one sat on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have to be like this to listen to others?" He looked at the ice blue mixed with emotions such as surprise, fear, unwillingness, anger and so on. "I have already said that I am not building a grievance tower for the sake of gaining strength. I am trying to save you from this subordinate... Can you not understand?" His voice was filled with anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh... forget it..." Looking at the face of the ice blue, the anger that suddenly emerged from Kim suddenly disappeared as quickly as it appeared. "Whether you like it or not, whether you are qualified or not, you are now a leader. A leader must be responsible to his subordinates, and must distinguish between enemies and allies, not casual and enemies. I am not your enemy. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You..." Ice Blue looked at Kim’s move and stuttered. Jin held the sword in one hand, and the other hand stroked over the sword. The lightning bolt of the electric light immediately calmed down. "What is it... Who?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing is. I am just a traveler looking for something." Return to ice blue. "I don't intend to hurt you or the wizard king. So you can treat me as someone who is willing to help you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But... You just..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can barely count as a magician." Kim replied. "Don't confuse the magician with the wizard. Only those magicians who are blinded by power and unscrupulous for power will fall into a wizard!" He suddenly thought of the black cone, and if the black cone was by his side, he must have begun to refute it. And to refute something he can think of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there any other magician of the wrong wizard?" The black cone must pat the wings and answer ironically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A strange sound came from the roof. The two looked up and saw a meaty, hungry gaze plunging into the small window on the ceiling. In the time of this meeting, the meat eater actually climbed onto the roof. Fortunately the window is really small, these monsters can't come in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oops... these things couldn’t have climbed up... Yes, it must have been the magic that we just released to stimulate them." Kim concluded. "If you don't want them to break through, don't use magic, including your sword."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A meat eater began to scratch the roof window violently. Fortunately, this part of the roof is also very strong, and this kind of behavior is not a threat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We don't go out here, will they leave?" asked Ice Blue. There is no hostility and anger in her voice, but a very weak voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No. Although they gave them the instinct to be eager for flesh and blood... In fact, they don't need to eat. Giving these instinct just makes them more suitable for fighting. Humans are not The law and the drag on them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Use more brains, use your brain!" Kim suddenly remembered how the black cone flapped his wings. He couldn't help but sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows why, he always remembers the black cone, and the crow is only separated from him for a little while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can I deal with meat? When I first created this kind of monster, I have already considered various methods of dealing with it, and then disintegrated these countermeasures one by one. Finally produced. These monsters don't need to eat, but they have the instinct to attack humans. No order other than the creator is accepted. Long-range weapons have no threat to them, and once they fight me, they will explode again. And their reaction to magic is especially intense. Once they feel the magic, they become fierce and anomalous. They rush to the caster in desperation... The bigger the magic, the more they stimulate them, but they don't eat magic attacks. Unless you deal with carnivores with the idea of ​​reciprocal sacrifice, there is almost no way to destroy these monsters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Worst of all, the power of these monsters to explode comes from their own lives. The power of the explosion can neutralize any magic. So it is simply unrealistic to want to put on a defensive magic to attract them to explode. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best way to deal with such monsters is to avoid them. Avoid it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The sacrifice of equivalence..." Gold whispered to himself. Even if it is a black cone, I am afraid I can't think of other good methods. The only way to fight this law is to do so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't look like they can't be dealt with." Kim looked up at the window. A meat cockroach stretched into one arm and frantically caught in the air. He looked back at the ice blue. "I will go out and deal with them, you should be careful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You go out?" Ice Blue asked in surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassured, after all, I am a magician, the magician always has some tricks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kim went to the door and paid a little attention to the situation outside the door. From the sound analysis, there is no meat eating at the door. He opened the door and immediately slammed the door off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meat eater around him immediately found him. All of a sudden, including on the roof, all the monsters rushed to him. But they didn't rush to the side of Kim and stopped. They looked around in confusion and left the gold slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold controls the flow of life in your body. This trick is also useful for carnivores. A smart human can easily distinguish him, but a smart meat eater can only rely on observing the flow of life to judge whether he is a living thing. They can't observe his anger, and naturally they will see him as something different from stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe in the blink of an eye, he is just a big leaf that is blown by the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold went to the middle of the valley, and there was a big rock in the still tumultuous stream. He pulled out a thick piece of paper, and the piece of paper he put in his close pocket, it seemed to be just a very ordinary spare note. Almost no one will notice the small, crystallized pieces of the above - including the Rebels.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black cone will definitely get angry afterwards - do this thing But it is very laborious and time consuming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jin read a secret language. The magic crystal on the paper began to glow immediately. He looked at it, whether it was surrounded by the black room or piled up at the entrance of the cave. All the meat eateres felt the fluctuation of magic, looking to this side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come on, monsters!" He stuck the piece of paper inlaid with the crystal of the demon on the big stone. Under the influence of magic, the stone began to be incredibly distorted, and finally became a human body with all four limbs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No more. The meat eater rushed under the stimulation of magic, and the stone people greeted it. In a twinkling of an eye, all the meat eateres gave up the original goal and rushed over to the stone man. They grabbed and bite against the sarcophagus, but they did not work for the stone scorpion. The sarcophagus walked to the entrance to the valley, and the meat crickets clung to it, continuing a meaningless attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician called Kim has gone out for a while. Did not hear any battle or tears. It seems that he is invisible, or in what way to avoid the eyes and ears of the meat. The sound outside was very calm, and there was no meat eater and then came in from the small window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am just an ordinary woman after all? Ice blue holds the sword and curls up in the corner. "A leader must be responsible to his subordinates." The man's voice still echoed in his ear. Is it too much that I want to prove myself? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She still remembers the battle, remember very clearly. Soldiers of the Witch King rushed out of the ambush point in all directions, surrounded by overwhelming numbers. The rebel fighters who were immersed in the joy of victory knew that they had fallen into a bigger trap. Armor and squeaking in all directions make people feel overwhelmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's a trap! Go out!" a voice shouted. All the people follow the voice of the master and charge in one direction. But a cold light fell in the darkness, and even less than a second, everything was over. When the breakout succeeded, she discovered that she had become the leader of the rebel army. Not for the other, it is her magic ability, and she is the sister of that person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it is the leader, she must hide all the sorrow; because she is the leader, she must deal with all the things she is not good at; because it is the leader, she must Regardless of safety, rushing forward; because it is the leader, she must...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Qualification?" Ice blue whispered to himself. Maybe the man is right, no matter how hard she works, she still lacks qualifications and lacks the qualification to lead others. She tried hard to get out of the shadow of her brother, but the consequences were deeper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was an earth-shattering explosion outside. The shock wave screamed and shook the entire stone house. Ice blue clenched his sword and looked at the ceiling, not knowing what was going on outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pinch the door handle from the outside with one hand. It was actually a very slight mechanical twist, and it sounded like a thunder blow in the nervous nervous person's ears. Ice blue clenched the sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door opened, and the man named Kim came in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I finally solved..." Kim went to the newly created Tower of Wraith and began to recite another spell. A ray of light emerged from the pillar of the stone that sealed the human body. The pillars of the rock rise and melt like bubbles. At the end of this magic, only the wounded were lying quietly on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I said that I am not a wizard." Kim smiled at the nervous blue standing on the side and picked up the wounded. "Let's go, it's safe to go back now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about meats? How do you deal with them?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sacrifice. As long as there is sacrifice, it is not difficult to deal with meat eateries."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sacrifice?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Speaking, you don't understand... let's go back." Kim suddenly thought of a thing. "There are no living people in Thousand Lakes... So what about those caravans?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the difference between a resident and a resident..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you not stop those merchants from entering the tiger?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop... What is the use? I don't believe it, it's more convenient to force them to leave. I hope I intercepted the team so that you can find what you want, instead of letting me owe you a favor as I do now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold smiled. "I don't care..." He repeated it in a low voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold went out and the ice blue followed. There were nearly a hundred meat eateres that wandered around the valley, and now there is no more. The distance is close to the end of the valley, that is, the area where the rebel army is used as a logging area. A huge trace has emerged, which is obvious in the green grass, just like a black circle painted on a green canvas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hurry up." Kim urged a cry, and the ice blue didn't pay attention to the weird black, and followed Kim to the cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as they ran, a stone at the hole loosened and the whole stone rolled out. Maybe it was noticed that the monster outside was running, and the people in the hole were going to come out and find out. Jin Xinzhong thinks like this. As he thought, a figure appeared in this gap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure is covered in red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man walked a few steps and finally fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's the matter... Raj?" Ice and blue rushed through the gold and rushed to the fallen man. She turned over Raj's body and patted his face. "What's the matter?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry... Ice Blue... We have failed you..." The man woke up and recognized the person in front of him. He whispered because he had no strength to use a louder voice. "We all failed you... We didn't block it in time... let some monsters rush in..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold found this man covered The cause of blood red. His back and waist were violently torn off a large muscle. The wound even reveals the white bones of the forest. This injury, combined with this bleeding, has not been saved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No!" Ice blue made a terrible cry. He threw down the Jay and rushed to the gap. Kim also put down the wounded in his hand and followed the ice blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cave is a mess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold doesn't have to think about what's going on. When they hid in the stone house, the meat eater also rushed to the front of the hole. The hole was not tight enough, and the monsters opened a few gaps - in short, several meats rushed in. In the unavoidable situation, some people have swords to greet these monsters, and then...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The full holes are wailing. I don't know if I am lucky or unfortunate. The people in the cave are very scattered and there is no concentration. Therefore, when the meat eater explodes, there are not many people who are being blown up at close quarters. But that's fine, it's a hundred, no pain. Now, the injured bones are broken, the wounded limbs are missing all over the ground, and the sorrows are everywhere. The ground of the entire cave was almost dyed red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crying of the injured child, the snoring of the woman, the curse of the man’s pain, the prayer of the old man, dyed the entire cave with the color of hell. Kim remembers that the Rebels (including their families) originally had six or seven hundred people, but now they can move, and the number of lucky people who care for the wounded will not exceed thirty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How could it be..." The sword in the ice blue hand fell to the ground. Her legs were soft and she reached the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Wizard King succeeded. The meat cockroach is so powerful that it has been around for a long time, and the resilience of the muddy slick has actually been completely annihilated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Xu Na!" Kim is looking for someone in the crowd. He quickly found the goal, and in one corner, the female therapist was kneeling in front of several unmoving bodies. Fortunately, she did not seem to be hurt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden flies past, and the black cone does not know where to fly. This crow protects himself well and has no harm at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gold, I heard the news, the group of businessmen were not intercepted by the Rebels, they must have entered the Thousand Lakes City. And now must be in the Thousand Lakes City. And the wizard king didn't know what experiment he was doing. He killed all the people in the city... Hey, Kim, are you listening to me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I already know it." Jin simply replied that he didn't stop at all. But he had to be careful about the broken bodies that would be stepped on at any time, even directly to the wounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is nothing wrong with us here, we can leave and go to Qianhucheng immediately."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Don't leave these people alone? They will all die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In any case, life is only a hundred years, they will die sooner or later." Said in a disdainful tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold suddenly stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The black cone..." he whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You once said that the greatest sin of the wizard is that they despise the ordinary people and think that they are favored by God, the high race..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, The root of all disasters lies in pride. The ancient magic dynasty is like this, and the current wizarding dynasty is still the same."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The difference between your words and the wizards Are you proud, ignoring these mortals!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uubei haha ​​laughed, flapping his wings and flying, watching the gold running in the air That little therapist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold went to the front to see who was in front of Xi Na. Sitting quietly on the side without a month, wearing a konjac in his hand. Her wounds are on her shoulders. It may have been stabbed by gravel, and her shoulders were bloody and fuzzy. However, in comparison, this is only a flesh injury. In front of Xi Na is the night wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white wings are full of blood and filth. One wing only leaves the last bit of skin connected, and the other one breaks from the middle, and the weird bends an angle. All of her body was soaked in blood and mud. Seeing it, the winged person opened his wings and suffered the impact of the explosion of the meat. If the injury on the wing is only a trauma to the limb, not so deadly, more serious damage is in her body. The blood hangs down the corner of her mouth, indicating the impact of the explosion and the viscera. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Xu Na!" Jin shouted. The girl looked up slowly. Her face looked expressionless because of excessive nervous fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Kim... What to do..." Her voice was filled with heart-wrenching trembling. "It's going to die... everyone is going to die..." She raised her hand and her hands were full of blood. "A lot of blood..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come on them!" Kim shouted. "Now it's up to you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't do it..." Yuna suddenly burst into tears. Tears are as constant as the flood of the dyke. "Oh... I can't do anything..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold controls the impulses in my heart and reminds myself to be calm. He knelt down and held the girl's shoulder and let her face herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Listen to me, Xi Na, only you have the ability to heal, everything can only depend on you. You are a therapist! Do you understand? Don't cry, Treat those who are dying first, only you can do it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't do it..." The girl wept. "I just learned a little with my father... I am not a therapist... I have no chance to exercise my healing spells... I have used up my strength... but I can't do anything... ...the night wind lady is going to die... everyone is going to die..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Calm down, I can help you..." Kim comforted. However, the girl has completely collapsed, she cried, not even heard the words of Kim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Calm down!" Gold roared, but it didn't work. He grabbed the girl and hugged her whole person with her armpit, but Xina continued to cry. He looked at the girl anxiously, but for a moment he couldn’t think of a way to calm the therapist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of death is increasing, and the messenger of Pluto is coming soon. There will be no chance later! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold suddenly kissed Yuna’s lips and kissed in anger. This is actually very effective, the girl finally stopped and did not cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you calm down?" A few seconds later, Kim released his lips. He looked at the girl's eyes and asked in a very calm tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah...is...yes..." Yuna was flustered, but she finally didn't cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Listen, Xina. You must understand that now you can save everyone... listen to me, don’t interrupt me. You are a therapist, you Only you can save all the people... I can only help you. Now, start your prayer, the prayer your goddess has given you, wholeheartedly, don't think about anything else."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xina bit her lip and pressed hard a few times. She closed her eyes and sat down, starting her prayer as a practising therapist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A beam of light fell from the sky and fell to the quiet prayer of Xi Na. The cave at the top of the head seems to be transparent, and there is no way to stop the light from falling. People can see this rare vision, a light that is projected from the depths of the sky and shines on the earth. It is more dazzling under the radiance of the sun, revealing the indescribable sacred feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the existence of a certain high-altitude heaven is about to come to the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original snoring in the cave calmed down. All the living people are watching this incredible scene. No, not only because of the shock brought by this scene, but the pain that afflicted people suddenly disappeared. The wounded were surprised to see that their wounds were recovering at an alarming rate. It is not ordinary healing, but even the lost limbs are rapidly growing again. What is even more incredible is that the bodies that have been fragmented because they are involved in the center of the explosion are actually regrouping into a complete body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold stood behind Xina, and he placed one hand on Xina’s head, and the light of the sky fell on his hand. He looks very calm, his eyes are closed, and peace and quiet. But if someone looks at him carefully, they will find that the reddish blood is gradually extending along his neck to the face. The roots of the blood vessels hidden under the skin rise and then turn into a reddish color. It seems that the roots of a certain plant must grow rapidly along his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black cone rushed down from somewhere on the top of the cave and slammed into the gold. There was an invisible wall shrouded outside the gold, letting the crow hit a head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gold, you stupid!" This time the crow is really anxious. It wraps around the gold body and flies around, but there is no way. "Stop, you have done enough. Stop it!" It doesn't care for anyone else. "You are a bad guy, big idiot, waste, garbage, idiot!" It screamed, maybe he didn't know what to expect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold did not pay attention to the black cone. It seems that he did not hear the black cone. The blood vessels rise for a while, then turn red, from the cheeks to the eyes, and then spread up to the forehead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The miracles around are still going on. People have forgotten their injuries, just watching this girl shrouded in a beam of light. In the light, the body of Xi Na is like a goddess. The radiance of holiness surrounds her, and all sickness, hurt, and even death give way in this light. Those who have died send out the shackles that represent life, because the power of death, the power of Pluto, is isolated. In this light, pain and death are rejected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold finally released his hand and retreated. It was not until the rock wall stood up. His tall body seems to have been absorbed all the strength, and even the station can not hold on, and finally fell slowly against the stone wall, sitting on the ground weakly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are a big fool, look at the good things you do!" The black cone flew to the head of the gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry... Ugly... Rest assured, I will remember my duties..." Gold gasped and gasped. The corners of the mouth flowed out of white foam. "Oh... I thought it was too simple... I didn't expect it... Damn... I shouldn't have done that grievance tower..." He gave a violent cough and almost breathless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have reached the limit!" The black cone stopped in front of Kim. The face of gold's face gradually appears a pathological black, forming small black spots, just like those grasses that have got sick. "It’s really trouble...you’re really in trouble.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one else noticed Kim. All the eyes of the people looked at the incredible beam of light, and the girl who prayed in the pillar of light. The power of the goddess of life is still going on. The minor injuries have already healed, and the seriously wounded who have lost their limbs are basically innocent. Only those bodies that died once are still recovering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in fact, not only this cave, but hundreds of people are watching this miracle. In the farther places, the stretch range is about a few thousand kilometers, and countless pairs of eyes have seen this incredible miracle. Thousand Lakes City is no exception. On the highest platform of the castle, a figure is also looking at the miracle light with surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is..." The Wizarding King observes the pillar of light that connects the heavens and the earth. All this is so surprising, even if the sky now splits a gap, it is not surprising that a certain god will descend directly from the world. The power of this light has a great influence, and the wizard king can clearly feel that the source of his magic is being weakened. The power of the Tower of Wraith comes from pain and fear, and the power of this light is alleviating all suffering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A therapist..." The wizard king judged, but it was almost impossible. "It's a group of therapists... Are they doing the ritual of summoning the goddess?" The wizard king repeatedly considered it, and it seems that there is only one possibility. The main force of the Rebels is actually composed of therapists? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sounds incredible, but there is no other reason to explain this miracle. Miracles don't appear casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meat eater must have played a role. But since the Rebels have enough power to summon the goddess, those monsters will never have any chance. He always thought that these rebel forces were just ordinary people, and those who did not know what to do with their own stupid guys. It seems that he is a light enemy. No wonder they can easily escape the tracking of his magic, but also frequently attack under his nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Wizard King hurried into the room. This situation may be somewhat beyond his control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light column finally slowly dissipated. All the people were shocked by the miracle of this sacred glory and glory, and no one even calculated how much time had passed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last glimmer of light faded from the body of 夕娜. This girl, who has been sitting squatting, keeps her praying posture loose, and the whole person threw herself in the arms of the night wind in front of her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Xi Na!" The night wind is the first to wake up. She patted the girl's face. Xi Na gave a low voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened to her?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing!" The black cone flew from the oblique thorn "It's just the inevitable consequence of summoning divine power. Her five senses will lose their effect for a while. It can be restored in about a day or two. Rest assured, there will be no sequelae."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others have also woke up from the shock. People can't believe in their bodies, and then look at the blood and debris of the land. Most people even think that this is just a dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What have you done?" No moon walks against the wall, the gold sitting still. She caressed the wound on her shoulder, and the original bloody wound is now smooth and delicate. If it weren't for the gap in the clothes, she couldn't even believe that it all happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing." Jin Lili replied. The dark spots on his face have receded, and it looks no different in peace. "I didn't do anything, it was Xi Na who saved everyone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But she...what is this?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Spiritual power, can't you see it? Directly use your own body as a medium to summon the goddess of life - although it can only summon a part of the goddess with human endurance, but it is enough. Xi Na summoned the goddess, so the wounded recovered and the dead returned."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She does not have this power."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you know? You are not her..." Kim said with some sarcasm. "Take your nephew down. After the impact of the power of the goddess of life, the power of the original God of War on the handcuffs has disappeared."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Summon Goddess?" A sound is heard. No moon turned over and saw the expression of ice blue shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What did the girl just do... is to summon the goddess? I have heard that powerful therapists have the power to return to life... but I really didn’t expect it to be so small. The girl..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are not big enough to go." The black cone whispered to himself. Of course, I didn't hear the ice blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What did you do just now?" Ice blue looked at gold with a question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am helping her to stabilize her mood." Gold struggled to answer. "A little trick." He smiled hard. "The power of God is too strong...not mortal can bear. She can't move for a day or two. I am a little better than her, but it is also awkward."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Ice Blue turned and left. She has more things to do. This time, it was attacked by carnivores. If there is no such miracle, perhaps they have already been wiped out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing, gold?" The black cone patted the gold face with wings. Kim looked up at the top of the cave and continued to breathe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s worse than I thought." He tried his best to reach out and his hands were full of weird black scum. "Sure enough, the body began to collapse... After all, summoning the power... is still too strong..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You fool, you think you are really god "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although it is very difficult, but my heart is still very happy..." Kim said as he gasps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be happy, you are an idiot. Now whoever takes a poke on you, you can be with the gods forever!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hot...after all..." Gold waved the black scum, and he sucked in the mouth. "Now I feel that I am still a mortal... a mortal with limited strength...not a monster..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Monster? This is what you are about yourself. View?" The black cone couldn't help but laugh out loud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I got it wrong?" Kim gasped and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, maybe you are correct... At this point, there is nothing to be used as a basis for judgment." Wu cone stopped laughing and sighed. "Let's stay here, I will go outside to see the situation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black cone fluttered out of the hole. The men have all gone outside the cave, carefully searching the valley according to the order of ice blue, so as not to leave other threats. The women began to clear the blood and debris left on the ground. The black cone was listening to their conversation on their heads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The content of the talk is about the same as what the black cone thinks. Mainly about this miracle and Xi Na, but also related to gold. The gold at the time was really a bit eye-catching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His hand on the head of Xi Na, it really seems to be helping Xi Na - although in fact it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black cone flew outwards. The area that turned into a dark area because of the explosion was very eye-catching, so the black cone immediately understood the trick of gold against meat. And it is so familiar with Kim, so I immediately think of what Kim is using to complete his strategy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The idiot!" The black cone couldn't help but hate it. It quickly flew through the open space in the middle and came around the black land. Ice blue and several of her men are here. The height of the black cone fly is very good. On the one hand, it will not alarm the people below. On the other hand, it can clearly hear the voices of the people below. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...How did it do it?" A man asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know, it's like the monsters... I ran together and exploded."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I think it is probably incomplete magic. The Wizard King was not completely successful, so it was fratrical. The result was detonated and destroyed together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ice Blue Did not say a word. Although she didn't know what the girl was thinking about, she did not say what she knew. She just nodded silently, endorsing the explanation that "magic does not completely lead to destruction." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't really think...the girl has so much power. Why is she with the witch?" Someone raised this question. "Therapists and wizards are deadly enemies. I heard that the therapists have the power to destroy the Tower of Wraith, so the wizards spare no effort to hunt down the therapist."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Are they sisters? No... the difference is too far..." Someone made an explanation, but then he was denied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Forget it, don't think so much. Now the witch is not threatening us, and the therapist...if she didn't, most of us It’s dead. Regardless of the relationship between them, we should all be grateful for this relationship. Otherwise the therapist will not be here now, and will not save so many people.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Speaking of the power of the girl... Have you ever heard of a legend?" A person who had never spoken before spoke up. He is the oldest of all, and his hair has begun to whiten. "Two hundred years ago, when the goddess' temple was destroyed by the wizards, the high priests who remained in the temple and did not want to leave cursed the people who looted the wealth of the temple outside the fire. She predicted that human beings would end up paying for the betrayal goddess. The price, until the pain is enough to cover the sin committed. Until then, the messenger chosen for the goddess will once again bring the miracle back to the earth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"This has nothing to do with age. Her strength is the key."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a minute!" Ice blue suddenly opened and interrupted others. "I suddenly thought of one thing. Just now this miracle... Should Qianhu City be able to see it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People squat for a few seconds, then immediately wake up The meaning of this. Miracles or gods are limited, and the power of the wizard king is unlimited. Perhaps at this moment, the Wizard King is ready for a large-scale destruction of magic and is planning to release into this valley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have to retreat immediately! Bring everyone together, first withdraw into the hole, ready to leave, the sooner the better!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sky, listening to all these cones is also amazed. The inference of ice blue is reasonable. It didn't continue to listen, and made a roundabout and flew back into the hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How, Ugly?" Kim was breathing on the rock wall, but saw the black cone rushing in, and he struggled to sit up straight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I didn't think of it for a while. The wizard king probably already knows here, he will probably release the magic of destruction soon, or send his soldiers. Come over."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No...haha...cough...cough...black cone, have you forgotten? The wizard king is alive, after all, not The Necromancer. It is very difficult for the living to use the Pluto method. Unless there is an artifact as the medium... otherwise their grievance tower is generally incomplete. Now, after being attacked by the goddess of life, I estimate that the wizard king has no way to use it. What a large area of ​​magic... even to maintain the rule must be fearful..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is true." Wu cone sighed. "I was still nervous for a long time. Right, Kim, have you used the transient paper?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold did not answer. Just saying a lot of words in a single breath made him exhausted, he just nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Awful, how hard is it to do that? Do you know that it is a last resort to protect yourself, absolutely not to use it?" ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry...the black cone..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You should have better The choice is right!" The black cone suddenly deflated. Things have already happened, and blame is too late. "After recovery, do it now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It was really troublesome at the time... The best way to deal with meat is to sacrifice the spirit and to deal with meat. Oh, I can't find the right thing, so I have to..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Enough, enough, don't say it." The next wing. "I just turned around. You are doing too well today, everyone noticed you." It began to comb his tail feathers with his mouth. "But the ice blue does not say that you are dealing with those meaty foods, and you don't know what kind of heart is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe just curiosity." Reply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In short, don't be too eye-catching."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a noise in the hole The men who are out are coming back. Ice blue fear spreads quickly into everyone's ears. After understanding the serious situation, everyone immediately put down their hands and began to organize their equipment and prepare to leave. But it is easy to get away from the long-running old nest, and it is difficult to prepare for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are four away from the busy center. The night wind and the moon are looking at Xi Na. The position of the gold sitting is a little farther away from them, just in a position that is visible but inaudible. When the black cone and the golden talk, no moon turned to look at gold more than once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I said, Kim, the witch wizard is probably already suspected of you." The black cone quickly noticed this. "She knows a little about the therapist. She knows that the girl has no such power."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not necessarily, maybe the understanding between them is not so Much. But even if she doubts me, can she doubt what it is?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s also true. However, the little therapist is okay this time. It depends on the night wind."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't know, don't know. When the meat cockroach exploded, the little therapist was in the vicinity. If it wasn't for the night wind holding her, I guess the situation of the two of them should be just right. If so, then you It’s useless!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Yes, I’m so lucky...” Kim re-turned his head against the rock wall behind him and closed his eyes. The black cone also stopped at his side and combed the feathers slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not far away, no moon looks at this person with a complex expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing, what are you doing?" The night wind finally found out that there was no match for the moon. She looked down at the moonless sight, and saw the dead man leaning against the gold on the rock wall and the crow with the tongue. What do these two guys look good about? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No...nothing..." No moon turned back, concealing the surprise in the look. She never thought of hearing these conversations. When she used the magic to expand her hearing, she actually only tried to see if her magic had been restored, and she did not expect to eavesdrop on other people's conversations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man called Kim... Who is it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the possible attack of the Wizarding King, the Rebels are packing things at the fastest speed. At dusk, they are ready to finish. The Rebels temporarily abandoned some items that were not urgently needed and left with only the necessities. Because Kim and Hina were temporarily lost their mobility, the two of them were arranged to be taken away in a car. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original reservation for the no-month disposal is no longer possible. In fact, I have not mentioned it in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This trip is boring. Because, as mentioned earlier, Kim has completely lost his ability to act at this time. He can only lie down and gasp, and he is stubborn. But he is not nothing. At the beginning, Kim tried to convince those people not to leave the valley. Because there was no protection from the geographical environment, they would leave the Sorcerer’s reconnaissance magic discovery. But he immediately made his name wrong, and it was a big mistake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reconnaissance magic? There is no such thing here!" The rebel army soldier's head shook like a wave. "The sorcerer King Hoofley II will not use this kind of thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Because there are many ancient sites in the mountains of this area. These sites have some magical devices that are still in operation today. Reconnaissance magic is subject to restrictions and interference in this area. He will not find our activities. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not because this valley is special?" Kim suddenly understood that a major subject would slip away from his own hands and would not go back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This band is the same everywhere."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold recloses the eyes and lies down, the cone Then he laughed. But a hand that grabbed its neck immediately made it laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Give me shut up, you stupid crow!" The night wind swayed up and down the neck of the cone. "Don't bother others!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of Xi Na's sake, their identity has also changed from "capture" to "guest" without knowing it. The people who resisted the army were very polite to them. Their actions are no longer restricted, and even the bindings on the wings of the night wind are taken off - this is not good news for the black cone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This transfer was only arriving at another base until late at night. The fact may be the same as what Kim had expected, and the Witch King was hit hard in that miracle, and there would be no power to attack them. The rebel army was very nervous for the next three days, but the wizard king did not make any actual action. Even sent a few soldiers to the valley to see no. Calm people are a little uneasy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xena recovered on the second day. This girl is somewhat uncomfortable accepting people's diligence. However, Kim was far from normal, and he sat still all day. For other people's questions, his explanation is that "the old problem has occurred, and it will be good to stay for a few days." As for what is wrong with this, no one is willing to go deeper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new base of the Rebels is on a mountain plain. According to the results of the observation of the black cone, the distance from the Qianhu City is not much different from that of the valley. It is the same day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gold... sir?" A voice came. Kim did not look back and knew who it was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Xu Na? Is your body returning to normal?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am fine... ... are you still uncomfortable?" She approached gold. Kneeling down at the side of Kim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I'm fine. You don't have to give me treatment, your treatment doesn't work for me."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But...as long as it is a living thing..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am an exception." Gold is cold and rejects Xi Na. kindness. "For some reason, I can't be treated by a therapist."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hina was silent for a long time, and finally finally spoke again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Kim, I want to ask, what did you do that day?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kim smiled. "Should talk about what happened to you that day?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I...the god of the goddess... I can feel it, the power of the goddess suddenly comes On my body. Just when Mr. Jin’s hand was on my head. What did you do?” Xia stared at the golden face, but the faint smile on the golden face was like a fortress that could not be broken. "Only when I was a child, I had this experience. It was the one that gave me the prayer. The power of the goddess was with me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I didn't do anything." Kim kept a smile, facing the eyes of Xi Na. "That's your own power - it's just that you never felt it. I just provoked your potential. Did Leica grant you a new prayer?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes...Yes..." Xina nodded. She knows that Kim must have concealed something on this matter. "I didn't really think... I mean... I don't really think of a therapist... I just learned a little from my father when I was young..." Kim smiled and stared at her, making her suddenly panicked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, in fact, as long as the prayer of the goddess has been granted, it is a therapist who has the ability to heal. Maybe in the eyes of the world, it is necessary to exercise strictly. Mature...but you are already a therapist."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Kim... isn't it a therapist?" Yuna suddenly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't call me Mr. Jin, just call me gold. I look like a therapist?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, I also wanted to have the power of treatment." Kim regained his gaze from the face of Xi Na, turned Look at the red sun on the horizon. "But I finally gave up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah...why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because too Difficult." Kim hit a haha. "In short, Xi Na is still working hard. Only with heart, there is always a chance to exercise. Right, who is you without moon? You are not like ordinary friends."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah...this...that..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is there a reason to say? It doesn't matter, there are always people who can't Tell others the secrets." Kim suddenly reached out a hand and took Xi Na into his arms. Xi Na only struggled a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "All this is a secret between us." Kim looked at the expression of Xi Na's blushing heartbeat. "Things about the goddess giving you new prayers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A scene of good passion!" After the departure of Xi Na, the black cone fell from the tree. "Hey, I guess that little therapist is hooked on you." It looked at Kim's face with a smile. "To be honest, you really look very good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My looks?" Kim reached out and touched his face, smiling and laughing. The louder the voice, the more it turned into a big laugh. "My... looks..." When his laughter stopped, Kim repeated the black cone in a low voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reassured, Ugly, I understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm afraid you don't understand." The crow looked at the sunset to the West in the sight of Kim. "In fact, sometimes it doesn't mean what you don't understand. As long as you don't have enough awareness, you will get stuck sooner or later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Some into?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You must understand that you are no longer a mortal. Just understand this. Look, the second is coming." Finished, the black cone flew up The body immediately disappeared into the big tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The second?" The black cone makes the gold somewhat unpredictable. He turned his head and saw that the ice blue came over here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's the matter?" When Ice Blue went all the way, Jin asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Our spies in Thousand Lakes City brought a message." The expression on the ice blue face is full of excitement and joy. "The Witch King's Wraith Tower has collapsed. He is the weakest time...the only chance we have to defeat him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes?" Kim smiled and whispered. "Congratulations."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You... are you upset?" Ice Blue asked strangely. "I thought you would be very happy too."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You won't specifically tell me about this thing? I saw it from your eyes. Question.” Kim replied with a smile and a tired voice, and the eyes looked at the setting sun that had only revealed the last trace. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "Yes ...... I want to ask you ...... now rely on our strength, it is sufficient to defeat shaman king?" <br /> <br /> & nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Probably OK."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't need answers like 'probably', 'maybe', 'may'. I want A definite answer.” Ice Blue suddenly became angry. She grabbed the gold and unbelievably lifted the huge body of Kim. She was full of joy, but Kim’s attitude turned joy into anger – Kim’s indifferent attitude deeply stimulated her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are now a leader, you have to use your own decisions to judge everything, not rely on others." Kim still maintains a faint smile. "Do I have to agree with you just trust your own judgment you <br /> <br /> & nbsp;? & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;" I just want to hear your opinion of it! "Icy blue loud shouts.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Listen to the opinions? Let me be a staff member, then let me know what you know first. "Gold looked at the angry face in front of him and suddenly felt that he might have done something too much. "What happened in the city." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Wraith Tower collapsed. Under the command of the Witch King, his soldiers and his followers ran, for fear of being made a new grievance tower by the Wizarding King. Now there may be only the sorcerer Wang himself in Qianhucheng. The wizard king is now incapable of stopping the escape of the subordinates... I think he has nothing to be afraid of. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about the source? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Absolutely reliable, some of his soldiers joined us. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What if you change direction? If this is a trap. Because I understand that the strength of the rebel army is very strong, so simply set up a trap and use the bait to introduce the rebel army into the city? Kim talked and looked up at the tree, and the eyes of the black cone were staring at him.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is impossible." If his power is not really disintegrated, he does not seem to have to do this. He only needs a large area of ​​destruction magic..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you are sure, then act quickly." Dragging changes. In the beginning, there was no chance to defeat the Wizarding King. "Gold put his head back on the trunk. "If you get a chance, it is also valuable to take a little risk." "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;" I understand. & Nbsp;; & nbsp; & nbsp; "<br <br /> & nbsp /> Ice Blue walked away, black cone shelter from the leaves flew down <br <br /> & nbsp />;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;"But that's just ordinary power. It can be crushed by the advantage of quantity." Kim whispered to himself. The sun has sunk and the sunset is disappearing. "The black cone, my strength has recovered, I think we should go to the city. Go to find my thing." He looked at his hand. "The goddess is very kind to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have your bodyguards?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Oh... it doesn't matter. The journey is over. The agreement between me and her has ended. She is not my bodyguard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Also right." The black cone shot his wings. "Although I am still very curious now, why is she such a girl away from her homeland and come to this bring? To be honest, I don’t think she is doing anything. Her journey and her strengths and experience are not enough to protect herself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe... looking for something like me."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be a ghost, Ice Blue is probably convening a person to set off. We are also going with the past. But I still want to remind you that it is best not to worry about the wizard king. Too much will cause trouble."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thousand Lakes was originally a huge Between lakes. But the wizard King Hoofley decided to build his own city-state here, so he spent a lot of time and manpower to fill the lake. The original lake was divided into hundreds of small lakes, so it is called Qianhu City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden recites the origins of the city. In the night, the city, like the same monster, looks at the group of small humans who come to the city with a cold gaze. The gate of the city gate opened as if the monster had opened its mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold sits on one side of the hillside and watchs the rebel army sneak into the mouth of the monster. At this time, the whole city was black and lacquered, and there was no light at all. The hustle and frolic that should have existed in the city have also disappeared. This is simply a dead city. This is the true face of the city under the rule of the Wizarding King. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that there are no living people in the city. Even if the gold is far-sighted, I can't see even a little bit of activity. The rule of the wizard king seems to have really ended. Maybe Hofferly II has already escaped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You said that the wizard king is still not there?" The black cone suddenly asked for gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think it should be, after all, even if there is no grievance tower, he must have enough ciphers."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Secret language." Wu cone smiled and flapped his wings. Yes, every wizard king will set up enough secret words in his own nest. The so-called secret language is a kind of magic trap, which means that the magic is fixed on something. When necessary, the special magic can be used to make the magic work. A secret language is different from a magical spell. It can be fired in one sentence and does not require any process. This is the most basic skill of Force Magic (Magic of Force: the general name of magic for making magic items). But unlike the magic crystal, the secret language will gradually disappear over time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wizard king is still very strong - if he really arranges enough martial arts for battle and defense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We should go in." The black cone looked at the gate. The ranks of the Rebels have completely disappeared. The wizard king (if still in town) must have been aware of it. He probably has hid in a palace with strict defense, waiting for a battle against the army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he wins, he will use the captives to recreate the tower of grievances and restore the rule. Having said that, if he did not kill all the people in the city, he probably rebuilt the Wraith Tower at this time. No, maybe he has remade the Wraith Tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden down the hillside and come to the gate of the city. The city was dead, and even the footsteps could not be heard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thinking, gold, if a businessman enters such a city, he will immediately feel that it is not right. The only explanation is that they have not waited yet. If you have time to escape, you will catch it first." Wu cone reminded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know." Indeed, the goods of the merchants, that is, what Kim is looking for, should fall into the hands of the soldiers. Now that the soldiers are fleeing, they should be in the warehouse or camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's change the way." Kim looked at the city completely shrouded in the dark. If you want to find something in a city of this size (and only two of them), it will take a lot of time. "Maybe we should let the rebels help us find them. They are more familiar with the city than I am."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We better not to worry about the wizard king..." The black cone flapped its wings and glanced at the dead buildings around it. "But it seems that it is really difficult to find ourselves by ourselves. Maybe we should really launch everyone to help us find..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold smiled. "Well, then let's help them level the wizard king, and then let them help us find things. This can be considered fair trade, not a nosy. But where should the wizard king be?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It should be in the palace."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cone flew into the sky and flew to a high position. It found the goal without much effort - the wizard king's palace can be distinguished at a glance even in the dark. It is located in the middle of the city, with a tower standing in the middle of the palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "See the tower?" The cone fell back to the shoulder of Kim, with a pointed finger. "There is the palace of the wizard king."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ice Blue and her men?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I didn't see it, but it should be moving while scouting. If you run faster, you can catch up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold has not had time to answer . A glare of light suddenly came out of the top of the tower. In a flash, the whole city is like a white. The eyes that are used to darkness are dizzy. After the eyes finally adapted to the light, people discovered that the light came from the flame released from the top of the tower, and the flame burned in the void, forming a faint human form. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Welcome, brave rebel fighters." A voice came from the flames. "Welcome to this magic city, I have been waiting for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Witcher King!" Someone screamed. "He's still good..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't panic!" Ice Blue shouted. "He just made a fool of himself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you afraid of if he If you have strength, you have already used magic to attack, and you will use this set to scare people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant statue of the flame laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hahaha... It’s so good, little girl," the face made up of flames shook. "But even if it is me, when there is boring, you will come to entertain me. And you don't have time to go now. The mouse in the cage should fulfill the obligation to entertain the cat!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant image of the flame waved his hand, and suddenly there was a huge sound in all directions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The gate is closed!" I don't know who shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When the weather is clear, the gates will open by themselves, and you will be able to leave if you are still alive. I really look forward to the results, in the days of tomorrow, can live alive. How many are there left the gates? With this, the flames disappeared into the air, and the darkness of the dead was restored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be afraid!" Ice Blue strives to stabilize people's panic. The fear of the wizard king is deep-rooted. Everyone has seen the overwhelming overwhelming power. Although his subordinates have been fighting against the Wizarding King for so long, they have not been able to maintain calm at this time. "It’s just that the gates are closed. If the wizard king really recovers, this set of tricks has already been staged at the gate of the city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, I saw it. Is it gold?" Until the giant image disappeared, the black cone was opened again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Seeing...it doesn't seem to be the effect of a secret language."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That level... the secret language is probably impossible to achieve... It seems that the wizard king is not so good to deal with. It seems that your plan, "the black cone squinted at the gold, "it is very troublesome to realize." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even on this dark night, the structure of this magnificent palace can still be seen. The front is the square, then the main hall. From the temple, the central tower stands the magic tower that symbolizes the identity of the wizard king. This is a habit of the wizard kings. All the wizard kings built this tower to show off their power. Behind it is the garden and the giant laboratory. I don't know how many creatures were buried inside this gorgeous palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Look, here is the Wraith Tallinn." The black cone pointed with a wing. Jin looked down at the black cone and saw the opposite side of the square, leaning against a small cemetery in the main hall of the palace. A piece of tombstone stands, each of which is sealed with a soul tortured by eternal pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold went over and slowly checked the source of this wizarding power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All are dead." He looked at this grievance tower. There is no feeling of power fluctuations caused by pain in this neighborhood. This shows that Tali is no longer a living person. But for those who are sealed into the tower, death is a relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the power of the goddess destroying the magical cycle of the Wraith Tower? So the people inside are killed by the pain." Kim from the end of the cemetery Go to the other end. The mortal movements of the deceased who were sealed into the tower were strange, but all of them were painful and fearful. It is this spiritual power generated by this pain and fear that maintains the Tower of Wraith and provides the powerful spiritual energy of the Wizarding King. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now the wizard king should be unable to draw strength from here. The dead will not provide any spiritual energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He should have established a new tower of grievances. But even if he made it, the number will not be much. Can't be like the original..." Express your opinion. "Icy Blue should have a chance to win."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Opportunity..." Kim looked at the dead around. Their pain allows the wizard king to do what he wants. This is a great irony. “Why do you want to invent the magic of the Tower of Wraith?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It’s just an unexpected result in the magic experiment.” The black cone responded with an indifferent tone. . "It later existed as the highest penalty. Later, the Necromancer invented the method of using the power of the Wraith Tower as a means of attacking energy. Finally, the wizard Wang Bright studied the skill of using the power of the Wraith Tower to perform magic." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Strong and cruel skill." Kim scanned the entire cemetery. "But in any case, the power of the wizard king has weakened a lot. It is a fact. Although I don't know how he did it for the first time, he should not be difficult to deal with now. Let's go into the palace." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gates of the palace are also open like the previous gates. There was nothing dangerous in the main hall - even if there were any traps, it was triggered by the rebel forces who had entered before. In general, the Witch King's living place is their tall tower, and these places are suitable for placing large-scale attack magic whispers. Even if the entire building is destroyed, it will not affect the wizard king. However, as far as Kim saw it, the wizard king did not make that arrangement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They both walked through the hall. There is nothing to be concerned about in this place. It is luxuriously and cheesy everywhere, full of the taste of the outbreak. It's not like an environment where people who are concentrating on magic should stay. From this point of view, the magical study of the Wizard King here is only because of the hobbies or the nature of their cruel and evil. In fact, most of the wizard kings are like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a minute, gold!" As they walked out of the hall and were about to walk into the front courtyard, the black cone suddenly shouted. "There is something to come!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Things?" Kim stood firm and a powerful magic twitched in his heart. The wizard king may be terrible to ordinary people, but there is nothing to be afraid of for him. Even this state is the same now. Because he has a capital that no wizard king can defeat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A looming shadow emerges from the darkness of the courtyard and slams into them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Warcraft?" Kim stretched out his right hand, and the energy of destruction emerged from the palm of his hand and turned into a spear, suspended in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a minute, gold, don't do it! That's not Warcraft!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leave here, stranger." The shadow rushed to the front of the gold before stopping. Although it is only a false body, if gold can still be seen, this shadow presents the general outline of human beings. "Don't move on."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You...what is it?" Kim took back the magic and looked at the shadow in front of him in surprise. This kind of thing is something he has never seen before. He has never heard of such a creature (this thing seems wise). If you are looking for something similar, it is like a ghost mage in the Necromancer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The soul solidifies?" The black cone speaks to himself with an incredible voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leave here. Brave, you may be coming to defeat the Wizarding King, but you have no chance to win."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Recently others have said this..." Kim controlled his expression on a smile. "But let me first talk about what you are."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is a soul that is forcibly removed from the body and can not be destroyed after being transformed." Said. Its tone made Jin a surprise. "One of the evil spells developed by the Necromancer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah...that it..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It has no entity. Don't worry, although no method can directly attack it, it can't attack the real person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Leave, stranger." The soul continued with a miserable voice. In this kind of dead environment, its voice sounds sad and painful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who are you? The sorcerer's subordinates?" Jin asked. From the point of view of this soul, it does not seem to be a person on the side of the wizard king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You... can you see me? Hear me?" The shadow hesitated, and suddenly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Nonsense, do you think we are blind?" The black cone immediately picked up. "Who are you? Is it the wizard king who made you like this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You...not ordinary people. You are like the people in front, yes Want to come down with the Wizarding King?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can say that." Wu cone replied, it took a gold face with his wings, indicating that Kim should not speak. "You should not be the subordinate of the Wizarding King."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black shadow was silent for a while before reopening. "If you want to blame the destruction of the tower, to defeat the wizard king, I advise you to leave. This is not a shame. Because the wizard King Hoofley II is not weakened as you think, his Not only did the power not decrease, but it strengthened."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We don't worry about that, because we are not the brave people who want to defeat the evil wizard king." The cone laughed. "We just came here to rob the thief who is looking for something worthy. Thank you for your reminder, who are you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am just a dead person Shadow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To be honest, we need a little help and guidance. At the cost, we can free you. Although it can't make you rise, at least you can Normal death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black shadow has been stunned for a while. "That is impossible." It said leisurely. "Even even Hoofley II can't let me free."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't believe?" The black cone looked around with interest. "So let me strengthen your confidence. First, when you are alive, it is a woman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shadow slowly tapped his head . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The second point, when you are like this, the wizard king must stop in the mantra. Because he is a living man, his magic It is just an incomplete Pluto method. He can't maintain the magical energy needed for the soul to solidify. If the spell is complete, you should be completely controlled by the wizard king and become his scout and serve him. But because it is incomplete, You now have self-awareness and mobility."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Third, the way to get rid of your pain is simple. You can reverse it with a simple magic. It's just that the wizard king's own magic is not complete, so he can't do it. A person with complete magic can make you detached." The cone lifts a wing and draws a complex symbol in the air with a feather tip. "Do you believe me now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadows made a voice of unknown meaning. “What are you looking for?” she asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A bottle..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait, Udon..." But the black cone hit the face with his wings in time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Listen, Kim. Don’t make mistakes, as long as things get their hands, you don’t have to go to help ice blue. They don’t matter. Remember, the Rebels are and You have nothing to do with them. They are mortals who are destined to die." The black cone said to Kim in a low voice. Then it immediately faced the shadow again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A bottle with a red liquid. The mouth is big, the texture looks like crystal, and the mouth of the bottle is hexagonal. It is filled with powerful magic. Seal. Have you seen it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have seen it." The shadow whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know where the bottle is now, but I see Two days ago, the wizard King Hoofley II took the bottle and looked at the laboratory carefully. He seemed to be very interested in a certain secret in the bottle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Oops." The black cone whispered, but it immediately found hope again. "So what should be in the lab now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't think so. If he is really curious about something, he will carry it with him. That thing. The bottle is not very big."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn, I hate this situation." Wu cone said hatefully. And never talked, but an unobtrusive smile appeared on the golden face listening to the black cone and the shadow dialogue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, Miss Ghost, although we originally came to be a thief, but now it seems that we have to be a brave. But our The agreement is still valid, please bring us to Hoofley II, and I will honor my promise afterwards."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait a minute, you don't understand." "The shadow said anxiously. "The power of the wizard king has not been weakened. It is impossible for you to win him by the mortal body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't worry about us. Since you want to be a brave At least, there is confidence in being a brave." The black cone laughed, and it took a wing on the head of Kim. "This guy, though not very good, is actually very strong. The wizard king may not be able to beat him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadow was silent for a long time and finally accepted View of the black cone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay. Come with me." It floated forward, and the gold and black cones followed behind it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four figures appeared in front of them. The black cone sharply saw that it was four ice blue parts. These four people stood stiffly in the open space on one side of the garden, much like a stone sculpture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"fall into the trap." Wu cone commented. "The illusion trap. The combination of paralysis and illusion." These four people are very confused, they are trapped by illusion, and they don't even know that their body has actually been paralyzed. In their feelings, they should continue to move forward – continue to move forward without end. Until they die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am going to open this trap." Going to the four people, the trap was removed without any effort. The four senses of these four people returned to normal, but the effectiveness of paralysis was still there. They couldn’t move for a while, and they couldn’t even say anything. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be reluctant, if you have the ability to save others, if you feel dangerous, run away." Kim whispered to them. Then follow the shadow to move on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ice Blue once said that some of the wizard king soldiers joined them. It seems that this is true. Because the road that the shadows bring to them is the way forward for ice blue. On the road you can see the wreckage of some of the destroyed traps - the Sorcerer's soldiers are somewhat aware of this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadow hesitated, but in the end it drifted into the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold followed the door. With his footsteps, the tower's door suddenly slammed shut. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s about the same as the book." The black cone gave an evaluation, its voice did not fall, and the crystal ball placed in the center of the room suddenly flashed, a phantom Appeared over the crystal ball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Welcome, the last visitor. Your companions are waiting for you in front...waiting for you in hell." The wizard Wang haha ​​laughed and gloriously Flashing, the crystal ball fades and the phantom disappears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hofelli II must have seen a lot of third-rate adventure novels." Wu cone sighed. The deliberately put on the tone made the shadows unable to bear a smile. "Gold, in order to prevent us from becoming the hero of the novel, open the door."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The door is placed with powerful magic..." The shadow wants to stop, however This door, which was added with powerful magic, was pushed in the hands of Kim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Continue to lead us." The Umbrella said proudly. It seems that it is the door instead of the gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadow continues to lead the way, from the first floor around the escalator to the second floor. The room on the first floor is very empty, and there are a lot more things on the second floor, all kinds of furniture. But what is strange is that the second floor seems to be larger than the first floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The knowledge mastered by this wizard king is quite remarkable. He has at least understood the spatial expansion." Wu cone said to himself. The surroundings are very neat and orderly, indicating that the people of the Rebels did not waste any time here. "Right, ice blue may be an hour earlier than us?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not maybe, but it is indeed an hour ahead of us." Estimated a bit. "But I didn't hear any explosion of magical energy..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It won't..." The black cone will stop. "Right, Miss Shadow, obviously the Tower of Wraith has collapsed. Why is the power of the Wizard King not weakened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His owner lends him strength "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master?" Kim and the black cone looked at each other, but they did not wait for further questions, and their feet suddenly turned around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened?" The crow screamed and flew up. But it's useless. It couldn't grasp the balance and fell to the ground. The black cone looks around and sees that the scene is distorted. "Be careful, gold, is a space crack."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Jinbiwu cone is a little better, he lowered his body and was not ugly by this drastic change. This violent wave lasted for a dozen seconds, and when it finally calmed down, he found that they had come to a weird world surrounded by smoke. It was full of white smoke and the eyes could not see three steps. Moreover, only two of them came in, and the shadow disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We triggered the trap?" Wu cone asked himself, but it was impossible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, it is the space under the control of the wizard king. He put us all in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I didn't expect this wizard king to be real, to create a space under his control." The black cone was full of emotion in the fog. "But he used the fog to help and fell down. This undoubtedly shows that his control is not strong enough. This small space is not big enough, so you need to hide your eyes and ears. Let's turn around in this place first."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The black cone..." Gold suddenly opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If the Miss Ghost is telling the truth, then ice Blue them..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It should have been completely wiped out." Ugly answered casually. "Right, how about using a magic to drive out the fog? What's wrong with you? Kim?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why... you can look at it all so easily ...can you watch the people around you die without feeling? They are innocent people, they shouldn’t have died here... If I knocked down the wizard king, they could have gone back and reunited with their wives and children... Live for many years..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your words... it’s too cold."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't say it, you will be the same as me sooner or later." "Look, Kim, there is a shadow over there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the black cone said, a figure stumbled in the thick fog and ran to this side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that people who are dressed in this space by the Wizarding King are more than us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The figure is getting closer and closer to gold. At first it was just a shadow of awkwardness, and now the contours of the human body can be clearly seen. A very familiar outline. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ice Blue?" Kim finally recognized each other. When Ice Blue came to him, he was already falling. He reached out and gave it a hand. The girl's body fell into his arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened?" Kim turned the face of the ice blue. The ice blue lips are white and the eyes are closed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smoke around it suddenly dissipated, and the speed was incredible. Jin Meng only found himself surrounded by people lying still. The body of the rebellious soldiers who are in the cross is everywhere. Every one is motionless. He is not in any subspace now, and the surrounding walls clearly indicate his layer in the tower. A dozen steps from him, there is a spiral staircase. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Welcome here." A voice was uploaded overhead. Kim looked up and saw the old man in a silver robe standing on the upper end of the spiral ladder, looking dry and yellow. The old man's skinny hand clutched a wand with a huge magic crystal on its top. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I regret that there are only two guests left. It seems that my hospitality is too warm." The wizard Wang Xiao smiled and looked at Kim. "But I really didn't think that a poisonous fog technique would satisfy most of the guests."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Witch King noticed that Kim’s eyes were looking at the ladder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no need to find a stairway to escape, this is completely closed. Only through my space magic can come to this layer. Unless you grow wings, otherwise you I can't go up and down." He looked at the dying people below. "But in order to express my support for the sports spirit, I opened the window for you." He laughed. "If you want to leave, I won't stop it. If you jump from here, you can go." He pointed to the large window that was opened on one side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't..." The black cone noticed the change of gold, and he whispered. "Remember your current physical condition. If you want to send these people away with space magic, then you are ruining yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..." Kim looked at the ice blue in his arms and looked at the people around him. The Wizarding King obviously does not intend to kill people - he will use these prisoners to make a new tower of grievances. All of them are just in a state of sudden death and not dead. They all have salvation - in this case, the gold is unable to fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Abominable..." Kim clenched his fist and looked at the wizarding king who was laughing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't panic." The black cone is attached to the ear of gold. "He doesn't want to kill... This is no different from you. At least he doesn't want to kill now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's the matter? Isn't my offer unacceptable? "The wizard king looked at the mouse in the cage proudly." But if you can carefully observe the eyes of the wizard king full of glory, you can still see the vigilance in the depths of his eyes. The previous miracle gave him an extremely deep impression. He has reason to believe that this group of people who are easily settled is not the main force of the rebel army. These are just cannon fodders used to eliminate traps and reconnaissance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold glanced at the window. The window was open and the cold wind was constantly pouring in. He knows the height of the tower roughly, and he knows that he is on the highest level. This height is for human beings, jumping is a life of nine deaths. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Brother...Brother..." Ice Blue made a low embarrassment in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to escape and escape. I promise not to chase." The wizard Wang looked at Kim with interest. He regarded the hesitation of gold as another explanation. "But if you don't plan to leave, then change me to do it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it didn't happen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Magic wrong?" The wizard king changed a spell, and a thunderbolt shot from his fingertip. The power of lightning is still barely fatal. This time he understood that his magic was not wrong, but the magic disappeared when he arrived at Kim. The lightning seemed to be resisted by an invisible shield, and it was vain in front of Kim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am going to come to a large area of ​​killing magic." The black cone saw the horror on the face of the wizarding king and immediately made a judgment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold looked up to the wizard king, four eyes opposite. The wizard king slowly raised his staff and began to recite the curse. This time the spell is much longer than it was just now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gust of wind blew in, blowing gold clothes and hunting straight. The wizard king was not wary for a moment, and was blown out of balance by the gust of wind, and leaned against the stair handrail. "Who?" he screamed and looked out the window, seeing the white wings swept through the wide open window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A bodyguard." The night wind rushed to the wizard king and held a long shot. "Sorry, although we have no innocence, I have to protect the safety of my employer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"砰!" The long gun stabbed the invisible air. A wall that makes a crash. Although the magic of the wizard king resisted this, he still partially withstood the power of the gun, and the whole person fell on the armrest. This time he did not suffer any harm. The night wind stopped the gun and fell to the side of Kim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Night Wind? How come you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How come? Say, come on the fly." The night wind disdained and glanced at the gold. "I brought a person up. She is very heavy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you say? I am very light. I only weigh nine..." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing? Of course it is taking you away." Night The wind eyes stared at the wizard king. The wizard king did not react from the horror of the moment, but just stared at the winged man who suddenly emerged. "No moon says she knows the magic of space transmission and can take you away. So I brought her up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No month, you can take the people here Are you sending it away?" Kim suddenly realized that hope had arrived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can barely, but I can't do anything else." No moon answered. The top of the room exudes a yellow magical glow, dyeing the entire room in a dark color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do it. Just take everyone away. They will save, and Xi Na can save them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As you wish." No moon began to recite her magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ha ha ha ha ha..." The wizard king suddenly laughed. "Poor guys, even if you have magic messengers... you are useless." He raised his staff. "Let me teach you a little magical knowledge... Magic can be interrupted, the interrupted magic will not play any role, it will only waste the magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "But you also need time to recite spells." The night wind caught a long gun. "I will interrupt your magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although I want to tell you this is wrong, Miss Wings." The Wizard King has calmed down and started. Smiling slightly. "But I decided to stick to my sports spirit. I don't care if I jump from the window, but I want to leave in another way. My master will interfere." He raised his staff and pointed at the moon. The front end of the demon crystal of the staff head gathers a white light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Goodbye, lovely lady. Your magic is really too long. Ah hahaha..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night wind rushes again. The Wizard King has expanded his shield. The night wind has not been advanced for a few steps and is blocked by the invisible wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is useless, you can't be smart?" The black cone flew in front of the night wind. "You have to concentrate on attacking the weaknesses. The weakness of the wizard king is... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wizard king fell to the ground. The light from the tip of the rod hit the wall and made a hole in the wall. The remaining energy disappears into the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Night Wind... How do you know... The black cone can pass through the magic wall?" Kim asked in surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know." The night wind is crisp and crisp. "I just watched the dead bird not pleasing to the eye."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn!" The wizard king only got up half a day. He was holding a black cone that had already turned his eyes. The wizard king threw the bird back. However, his hand strength and skill can not be compared with the night wind, gold lightly took the black cone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic of no moon is finally finished. Along with the fluctuations in energy, all human bodies begin to disappear according to the laws of space transmission. It becomes transparent quickly and then disappears into the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gold...you..." The last night before the night wind disappeared, it was discovered that Kim’s body was not transmitted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, but I still have something to do." Gold whispered to the air in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You..." The Wizarding King is ashamed and angry. He made a wrong judgment for a moment: this person was not sent away because the female magician was not strong enough. In anger, he forgot the previous things and gathered a ruined magic in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rotten!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In shame and anger, this curse has exceeded the level of murder power. The wizard king is looking forward to seeing the whole person rot and dissolve, and from the beginning into a pool of mud, to ease his heart. However, this did not happen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This...how is it possible? Is it defensive magic?" The Wizarding King released a petritive magic that is more powerful and lasting. Even if the man in front of him is a wizard king, without the help of the Wraith Tower, this man can't insist on this continuous magical war of resistance - within a few minutes, the man's magic will consume light. And he has a source of strength that never runs dry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he quickly saw that something was wrong. It doesn't seem to be because the man resisted his attack with magical defense. Seriously speaking... It seems that magic is automatically dissipated by his side, not his power to resist magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is it possible?" The wizard king looked at the man in front of him in surprise. There was a cold smile on the man's face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that...there is only us left here. The wizard Wang Huofei Li." Jin Xiao smiled and looked at the wizarding king in panic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is another one." The black cone also stood on the shoulder of Kim. It changed the way it just turned white and foamed, and it became spiritual again. "Miss Shadow is also there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true, in the shadow of the stairs, the shadow of the lead is there. Just now Kim has not noticed the existence of the shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please don't..." the voice said softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, Miss Shadow, wait until I will honor my promise."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Who are you?" The wizard king finally realized. It’s not an accident or a magical miracle – it’s the power of this man. This man is not an ordinary person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I? Just a dead man." Gold smiled and walked up the stairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hofley released a blocked magic block at the stairway. Originally, anything should be too late, but this man broke the common sense, the magic wall was invisible, and his foot stepped on the first step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Quiet...monster..." All these visions made the Wizard King finally lose his fighting spirit. His magic didn't work for this man at all. As if for this man, these magics are not there. He turned and ran to the top of the stairs. At the top of the stairs is his secret room. The wizard Wang rushed into the room and immediately closed the door. This door has a powerful magic, even if it is a broken hammer, I want to hurt this door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This room is very interesting." Kim looked at the last fortress of the wizard king. The entire room is full of strange designs and a variety of weird utensils and machines, saying that the living room is better than the laboratory. Particularly striking is a high platform in the middle of the room. There are magic symbols and lines on the high platform. The four pillars stand on the four corners of the high platform, and the middle is a mirror made of mercury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but that’s not mercury. Kim immediately saw it, which is the materialization of highly concentrated energy. This thing should be the source of power for the wizard king after losing the tower of grievances. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You...what do you want?" The wizard king stepped back in the face of Kim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing. Actually we just found one thing, a bottle with a red liquid. Hand over the bottle, my lord the king." Flapping the wings makes your voice sound hoarse and harsh. "Otherwise you will regret it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous wizard king's look is just a little bit mixed with surprise. After hearing the black cone, the face of the wizard king changed greatly. He suddenly turned and ran to the high platform, and ran to the foot of the high platform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My lord!" Hoofley shouted loudly, waving his hands frantically, facing away from the gold, facing the wave of energy entities. "To protect your servant!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The energy mirror produced a noticeable fluctuation. The wizard king changed the look of horror and renewed his face with a calm and arrogant attitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surrounding scenery changes rapidly. In a blink of an eye, magic instruments, furniture, and walls disappear together, and they become a void surrounded by fog. The wizard Wang summoned his private space and surrounded the gold and the black cone. Only the high platform still stands behind the wizard king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be careful." "The power that the wizard king can control has just increased several times."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What defensive magic you just used." The wizard king asked again. "There are such strong defensive mantras... can you resist almost all attacks in silence? Why have I never seen such defensive magic?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A problem." The golden mouth smiled slightly. "Why has there been so many defensive magic in ancient times?" He looked at the wizard king. "The total number of defensive magic invented by mankind adds up to almost a thousand. Various functions, various types, strong and weak..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The wizard king clung to his wand and did not answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The reason is simple. Because the magic is not enough. Defensive magic needs to consume magic. In fact, it has already invented magic enough to resist the sword and spear, but the magician is still Often dying under the sword. Because the limited magic is put into defense, it can't attack. Even a powerful mage usually only uses defensive magic that consumes less effect. The sorcerer who has the support of the grievance tower does not have this problem. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold stepped forward and explained with a calm voice. "So, those more flexible and effective magic are abandoned in the wizard. They are meaningless. And those defensive magic that consumes a lot of magic and are equally powerful are preserved. Superstition is absolutely power, so the skill is no longer It’s important. It’s normal for you to not understand my defense.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Who are you?” The wizard Wang Jing is preparing for war. "Want to be a hero, revenge for those people?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw a staff in the hands of Kim, a sleek staff. Kim was very casual to carry the staff with his hand, facing the wizard king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you cut off your source of external force," Kim lifted his staff. "How much power do you have? How much magic can you use? Do you dare to arrogantly order others? Once you lose your grievance tower, the wizard will immediately hide yourself, put on a cloak, hide the true face, for fear of being The person recognizes... Losing the Tower of Wraith, the wizard becomes nothing, becomes a poor worm, and once he is recognized, he will only have a dead end... so relying on external forces, relying on self-deception, the wizard kings are actually true. Despicable ants."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You...is also a person who uses magic?" The wizard king stared at the staff in the hands of Kim. The only one who will hold this kind of thing is the caster. In fact, the staff is only valuable to the caster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Justice? I am not interested in that kind of thing." Kim raised his staff. The crack in the space maintained by external forces shook like a cloud, as if it was about to collapse. "I just came to find my lost property." He used a very light, light to say the last sentence as he could hear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"First, I want to tell you, I, Hoofley, not the same waste you used to defeat! I am the king of fire, Horfelli." Raised his staff and shouted in a confident tone. With his voice, huge energy is gathered in his hands. “For decades, I have painstakingly studied the lost knowledge in ancient ruins. I have been studying hard when those wastes that you have beaten waste time in boring pleasures. Let you see and see my results. This is I learned the knowledge from the ruins of the ancient magic dynasty, plus the ultimate magic of my own research."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame of magic from the front of the wizard king Produced in the void, turned into a fire dragon to the gold. The moment before the contact with him, the flame suddenly broke out and rolled his entire body into the fire. The area was filled with a slight crack. Excessively powerful magical energy has affected the existence of space, making this subspace the edge of collapse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hahahaha...Look. The ultimate flame spell, the flame of blood that is enough to evaporate the rock directly. No matter how strong your bodyguards are, It is also absolutely impossible to resist this super attack!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Excellent magic..." A sound of frightening him came from the fire. The crow flew up into the sky unharmed, completely ignoring the high temperature around the wings that could evaporate the rocks. "If you can rely on your own power to cast this level of magic. With this magic, you can be among the big magician. Even if you rely on external force, you can still be a good mage." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flames faded, revealing the body of the gold. Like the black cone, he doesn't mind the flame at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This...impossible..." The wizard king looked at it all incredulously. "There is no defensive magic that can withstand my bloody flames... there can be no magic to resist this... impossible..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is. If it is defensive magic, no matter what kind of magic can not withstand this level of attack. Even the 'absolute magic defense' is the same. The energy concentrated in the moment is so strong, it is too late to resolve the offset." A voice from the wizard king Coming behind him. The wizard king turned his head and saw a blurred figure in the mirror of energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He can resist this magic, not because of his defensive magic. It is because he has the elemental covenant. Hoofley, no matter how powerful your flames are, It is also impossible to hurt him. Because of the nature of the flame, the fire elf is not allowed to hurt him. Am I right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master..." The phrase of the Wizarding King has revealed the identity of this newcomer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are you?" Kim closed his face and smiled at the third party. The black cone fell back to his shoulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "According to courtesy, before asking someone, you should answer other people's questions first. Am I right?" The figure in the energy mirror is clearer and has presented a Human silhouette. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You said it is correct." "Who are you?" It repeated the question of gold again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am the king of the king. I will not tell you the name, because the name itself represents power - I will not expose my weakness to you. In front of the strong. You have to call me, let me be the great emperor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good arrogant self-proclaimed...the emperor?" . "Even if the monarchs of the past magical dynasty did not dare to claim themselves. Even the guys whose real names are afraid to say are still so arrogant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before the guardian, Any care is necessary. In the face of you who can shake the whole world by yourself, I think anyone will hide their real name." That voice is not subject to the fuss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this conversation, the figure of this mysterious man - since he claimed to be the great emperor, can only call him the great emperor - has become more apparent. At the moment the energy mirror is a figure wearing a white mage gown and a mask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your logic reasoning ability is quite strong." Wu cone said ironically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The spell added to this bottle is probably the seal magic that is only recorded in legends and myths - 'Chaos Lock'. It can't make me The cracked seal is only this magic. Although there are two mortals in the world who have cracked this magic, one is the creator of the mythical ancient magic dynasty, and the other is the witch King of the two hundred years ago." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You know exactly what you can." Kim smiled coldly. The drop of the bottle has been found, and the others have been temporarily put aside. He temporarily ignored Hoofley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But what is inside this bottle, I am really curious. It is worth adding such a strong seal. This red liquid is very similar It’s blood.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “The answer is right, this is really blood.” Jin cold smiled and looked at the emperor. "But this thing is not useful to me except for me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Blood?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the blood of the dragon. Strictly speaking, it is the refining dragon blood. Maybe you don't know the dragon. In the era of the ancient magic dynasty, I passed through the time and space, and collectively two hundred years ago. Leave the world's powerful race, the dragon. This bottle is the dragon's blood."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't underestimate me. But according to the dragons I know, they are The blood doesn't seem to be anything special."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's true, for ordinary humans... no, for any creature in the world except me." This is just meaningless ordinary blood. And this is my own thing. You claim to be the great emperor, you should know how to be polite, you should not take advantage of things that belong to others and are meaningless to yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hahahaha..." The Emperor made a burst of laughter. "I am very happy, guardian." When he stopped laughing, he put on a tone. “If you are willing to give me something to exchange.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Things? What do you want?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait, gold." The black cone stuck to the ear of gold, eagerly said. "Be careful, that's not ordinary curing energy... it seems to be a constant connection magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Constant connection?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold immediately remembered a similar record. The wizards of the ancient magic dynasty have always been a big headache for traffic problems. Although they make a lot of items such as the transfer magic array and the space operation ball, these things must be controlled by human power. More than one group of people wants to create magic that constantly connects two spaces, making it easy for everyone to use. But this research has never yielded results. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It should not be completely successful. Maybe you can't transfer live animals, but you should send a small item. It's definitely not a problem to transmit energy. He can attack you directly now. And you can't fight back to his entity." Wu cone explained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a guardian, I’m seeing it right away.” The bright black cone is very light, and it’s talking to the ear of gold, but the emperor still hears it. It is. "As long as we reach an agreement, I can return this bottle to you right away. I need your knowledge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why would you ask us for knowledge?" The black cone was surprised to answer. He originally thought that the Great Emperor would raise a more direct and more realistic question. It may even be a direct declaration to them for the sake of this subordinate. Or try to destroy the bottle of dragon blood with power. But the result was bigger than he expected. "And we don't necessarily have what you want."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, you have it. This is undeniable." The Emperor made a chuckle, he The hand made a complicated symbol. Although he was separated from the mask, he was still very excited to see from him. "I used to get all the books kept on Undead Island... When the King of Magic, Bled, destroyed the Temple of the Pluto and the Necromancers, the books were not destroyed. Instead, they fell to my hands. Those Some of the books are books of non-human races... collected by ancient humans from various races. From those records, from those words, I understand the presence of the guardian."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Guardian? I?" Gold asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Listen to him." The black cone shot the face of gold. "He won't believe what you say. Prejudice formation is hard to change."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was wrong?" The emperor heard the voice of the black cone, maybe What magic he used. "Is it not you who gave the legendary 'Hidden Magic Book' to humans? Was it not you who guided the higher goblins to defeat the devil? Didn't the Dark Grail and the Phantom Law pass to the Holy Light on the last night of the Battle of the Blood Lake? Are you? Is it not you who will give the dragon's contract to humans to defeat the necromancer?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is not me." Gold straightforward answer. Although he knew that the Emperor would not believe it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In any case." The Emperor did not have a defense reply. "I can tell you my hopes directly. I am just a mortal now. The sorrow of mankind is that it is doomed to die... I hope to have an eternal life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Stupid!" The black cone whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If this is the case, it is not difficult." Jin Xintou is loose. To be honest, he is very reluctant to let the dragon's blood disappear from his eyes again. This great emperor protects himself so well that in case he turns off the magic, Kim does not know how to find his dragon blood bottle. He did not know the appearance of the emperor, nor the address of the emperor, nor the real name of the emperor. There is no way to find it. "I can tell you how to turn into a necromancer. You can become an immortal being until it is destroyed by external forces."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are wrong." Looking at Kim, I can still feel his warm eyes through the mask. "Since I got the entire library of the Necromancer, how can I not know how to turn into a Necromancer? I am also very clear about what the consequences of becoming a Necromancer. Although I can live forever, I will lose my senses. I can't taste it, I can't hear it, I can't feel it. I can't enjoy food and wine, and I can't sit on a beautiful woman - because these enjoyments will make no sense to me. I want a body like you." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am such a body?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, you can completely control yourself. You can always be young. Vitality, immortality; can isolate all the discomfort of pain, itching and fatigue; can preserve the senses of appetite and sensuality. This is what I want."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Stupid." The black cone once again evaluated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey...hey...haha...hahahahahaha..." Kim really horrified for a few minutes, then slowly smiled, the more laugh The louder the sound. "This is your ideal? Your hope? Hahahaha... It really suits a human ideal. Permanent pleasure goes on... Hahahahahaha..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;He has been laughing and leaning forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you want to say that our transaction can't be reached?" The emperor changed the warm tone of the moment, and the gold smile interrupted with a cold voice. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the case." Kim stopped laughing and replied in the same cold voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Guardian." The Emperor said slowly. "I know that your strength is very strong, but I also know that you are very weak now. When Hoffelli told me that someone had summoned the goddess, I was keenly aware that this must be related to this bottle... You are separated by so many geniuses. Appears, this means that the load of summoning the goddess is too great for you. Do you have much power now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Try it." Jin smiled. "Then I know if it's correct."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Guardian, don't be too proud of it. You can't even maintain a defensive magic now... You, only rely on the elemental covenant to protect yourself. I want to tell you that the elemental covenant is not a panacea! Hoofley!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gold has been neglected on one side The wizard king launched an attack. The gust of wind swept through this space, and the huge vacuum blade produced by the wind slammed into the gold body. But this is not a mere curse. At the same time as the vacuum wave attack, the energy of the lightning has filled the atmosphere, and the blue electric light jumps around the gold body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Collection of two different attributes of the magical attack, the elemental covenant will not work..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"Great!" The Great gave a sigh. "Sure enough, what you have is not an ordinary elemental covenant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If before this sentence, Kim has always been calm, then in this sentence After the words, his expression began to become severe. He understands that maybe he has underestimated this opponent. However, according to human psychology, he still has some hopes. He hopes that the emperor is not really understanding but just talking about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Wizarding King began to use new magic again. Obviously, there is a spiritual connection between the Emperor and him. He can hear the instructions of the Great. The magic used by Hoofley is a magic that continues to work in a wide range. All kinds of different magical energies, such as feng shui, sour, ice, and so on, are all concentrated and mixed into one to attack the blonde. Of course, as before, these attacks are still ineffective. The Emperor himself has never shot, he is watching gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Useless." The gold field is waiting for all the attack magic to end. "So now it's my turn." He reached out. "Dark wind, come back to my hand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic sword instantly appeared in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stepped forward with the sword, and the wizard king retreated, leaning on the high platform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An energy is transmitted from this constant connection magic, directly to the gold. It is a very common wind blade. The wind blade crossed the face of Kim and left a blood mark on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How can I be hurt by magic?" Kim reached out and touched his face, revealing an unbelievable look. He looked up at the image of the Emperor in the mirror. The emperor did not know when he had hidden the dragon blood bottle and replaced it with a silk gauze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sure enough. The law of chaos is exactly like this. There is no 'complete' in chaos, you can't have all the elemental covenants. Guardian, you have The weakness is that healing is your weakness. Just mix the healing in other magic and you will immediately break your invincible body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No ...you can't use healing." Kim couldn't help but shout. This is really out of logic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am sorry, I am a wizard and a therapist."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't listen He is a ghost, gold." The black cone shouted. "Look at the things in his hand. That is the artifact that the goddess of life gave to humans, the robe of healing. He relied on that artifact to use healing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Artifact?" Kim looked at the things in the hands of the Emperor. The silk gauze really looks a little different, as if there is a colorful cloud around it, and it is constantly shining. "That is the robe of healing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, I originally wanted to try one by one, but I didn't expect one to try it." The Emperor picked up the second thing. . That thing Kim has seen it with his own eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Holy Grail of the Dark?!" Kim said in amazement. How can the artifacts of the Necromancers fall into this person's hand? However, he recalled that since the collection of the undead islands fell to the hands of the emperor, it was not a strange thing that the artifacts were taken along with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This guy..." The black cone said lowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said not to look down on me, guardian. In addition to the orc and the higher leprechaun, my hands have now gathered all the races of this world. Artifact. I am more difficult to deal with than you think." He saw the expression on the gold face and laughed happily. "You are not invincible! Guardian, I will defeat you here, you will be mine! I will get your body, and then slowly study the mystery of your immortality!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Speaking... really nice." The black cone snapped a few wings. "The cowhide is too big to break."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you say?" The voice of the emperor changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The determination to hold 'beate others', but only release the magic of such a little power, you think that others are fools." The emperor pointed a finger. "I am very clear to see the new cracks on your magic device."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your constant connection magic can't really load the magic energy. Although it can transmit the spiritual power of the Wraith Tower to others, when it comes to the real fighting tool, this thing is too tender." evaluation of. "Even if it was just the insignificant attacking magic, the toy could not afford it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great did not answer. His silence actually shows from the side that the black cone is correct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And, if you want to use this toy to deliver substantial energy, you must first cut off the power of the Wraith Tower. So even if you want to release the healing, Your servant's release of the attack magic method combination attack will not work. Your servant's own magic has long consumed light. His help to lose the external force is just an ordinary cognac man."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hahaha...there is one more thing. A wizard always has an attacking magic left in the magic wand..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, it has just been released." Wu cone rudely interrupted the smile of the emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hofley!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hold...Apologize...Master..." Wizard The king trembled with a shocked answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hahahaha..." Now it’s the turn of the cone to laugh. "You may be right. At this moment, we are the most debilitating time. We are weak and we can't even maintain a defensive magic. But even then, you are such a person hiding behind, even the name can't say. What can you do? Come, and put a little magic like you just now, you can see the whole collapse of your toy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crow took a shot Gold face. "Gold, stand still, let his poor spells come and hit. As a compensation for how much surprise us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Emperor used fierce Looked at the black cone, but the black cone is just plain. It is difficult for humans to recognize what a bird is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, finally remind you. If you don't re-open your toy, don't pass the power of your grievance tower to your servant. This cognac old man is about to finish. Kim, on."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold in accordance with the words of the black cone, holding the sword to the wizard king. Everything is just like the black cone. In order to directly attack the gold with magic, the emperor can only cut off the spiritual source of the wizard king for the time being. Before he resumed supply, the wizard king couldn't even put a Martian, let alone escape with magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, master, don't give up on me..." Hoofley screamed. He had been watching the emperor, and thought that the emperor would immediately give him strength again. But then he found a dangerous sign from the eyes of the emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great is still thinking. Looking at Kim step by step approaching the wizard king and not saying. Obviously, he is engaged in a fierce ideological struggle to weigh the pros and cons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great ignored the sorrow of the wizard king and never resumed supply. The power of the wizard king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The space around it is gradually changing. The subspace where they were originally had disappeared, and they returned to the secret room of the wizard king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hofley, you are full of evil, go to hell!" Wu cone shouted, and Jin raised his sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a minute!" The shadow that has been lingering in this room suddenly fluttered over and stood in front of the golden sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss Shadow, rest assured. I don't need this wizard king to help you when you are free. We can do it by our own strength." Shadow interpretation. However, the shadow just shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... Anyway, he is my father. Please let him go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Father?! You? He?" asked the black cone with an incredible voice. After receiving a positive answer, the face of the black cone clearly revealed anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter how it is, even if it is to kill people in the city, even if it is an evil magic test, it is not the personal fault of the wizard king. It is the fault of the environment and society (although this does not change the evil nature of the wizard king). To despise the lives of other human beings is the common concept of all wizarding kings, but Hoofley's comparison is too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's open, Miss Shadow." Wu cone shouted. "If I let him go now... Wait until he continues to build the Wraith Tower to make something like you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadow shook his head sadly. "No... but he is my father after all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a minute, guardian, you seem to have forgotten me." The voice of the Emperor from constant magic Passed in. "He is my subordinate and doesn't seem to need you to do it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, use your poor little magic?" The black cone is unscrupulous other side. "Let it out. Your aunt didn't teach you how much to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So I did...the wind Let the light hear the order...to jointly awaken the dark king who sleeps in the sea of ​​eternal... break the people of the sky, borrow the name of 汝... all power is added to my body... wind blows!”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A tiny amount of energy is emitted from a constant transfer of magic. Even such a small amount of magic still makes a new crack in this incomplete constant transfer magic device. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wind Strike...damn, it’s a curse!" Kim immediately judged what magic it was. At the beginning, the tiny energy expanded rapidly, and the unstoppable momentum became the turbulence of the atmosphere. The great emperor made a decision, instead of a temporary retreat without a victory, it is better to sacrifice Hoofley in exchange for this opportunity to cause further damage to the gold. He used a curse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "End!" A powerful healing energy was released to Kim. In return for this move, the constant magical array made the last popping sound in life. The white energy has disappeared. This device turned into a waste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun rises to the east, and the morning light shines on the city in the mountains called Qianhucheng. In this first morning light. The top of the tower where the wizard king lived collapsed and turned into countless dust fragments falling in all directions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is just the beginning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There seems to be an invisible hand in the air, playing the city like a model. First, the tower of the wizarding king was broken up and broken. Then the scope is getting wider and wider. The buildings of the entire city were gradually shattered by this terrible force centered on the tower. The elf of the wind screamed in the air, releasing himself violently into this deserted city. When it hit the wall, this curse has already shown its true face. It was a huge giant tornado that swept across the city, bringing everything to the sky as a little dust. The head end of the tornado is connected with the clouds of the sky, and no one knows where the things that are being rolled in by such a tornado will fall. Maybe never fall back to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tall wall did not survive this destruction. The original fixed bricks also carried out a little resistance, but with the first surrender of the second block anyway, the entire wall was pushed to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the storm ended, there was no longer a city in the world of Thousand Lakes. Whether it is residents or buildings, it no longer exists. This is also the real use of the curse that was invented - uncontrollable to destroy everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the curse subsided for an hour, in a mountain that was several hours away from Qianhu City, a large pile of gravel bricks descended from the sky. The things that were blown into the sky by the dragons did not really become part of the clouds in the sky, and they eventually fell to the ground. The amount of these garbage is huge, and the rapid and endless filling of the mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn..." Gold struggled to push a stone on top of it and climbed out of the newly formed hill. The curse also took away the water of the big and small lakes in the city while destroying the city, so at this moment he was drenched. The black cone jumped out at the foot of Kim, and it turned into a soup crow. The black cone patted the wings and saw the water splashing, but it could not fly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...you can’t fly, I hate water!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s normal The words of the birds are actually not so troublesome. Because the bird has a layer of grease on the feathers and body. Even if you dipped in the water, there is absolutely no such exaggeration. The black cone is wet from the head to the foot. For the time being, it can only jump on the ground like a chicken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold forced to push another stone on one side and pull out a dying body. The former wizard king is now dying in pain like an ordinary helpless old man. Although Kim has tried to avoid the inexhaustible vacuum waves in the wind, it seems to only extend the suffering of the wizard king. Hoofley's chest side collapsed markedly - he was hit by something and the ribs were broken. Broken ribs puncture the internal organs, causing serious damage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you..." The voice of the shadow came. During the day, the shadow body looks light and almost invisible, with only one layer of smog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't thank...I don't know why I want to save him..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because You are a fool... an idiot with a bloody brain." The sharp cone of the black cone. "As long as you see the dangerous person, you will help. This is your instinct."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadow slowly leaned down. Her body couldn't touch the real thing, but she still made the action of "squatting on the wizard king." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Father..." she called in a sad voice. The wizard king turned his head and did not dare to look at her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are finally given up by him. I told you that you are just his tool, and once he feels that you are not using value, you will be abandoned." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mocking at me! Look at this opportunity to laugh at my stupidity! Laugh at my pity! Laugh at my failure!" The wizard king suddenly angered, blood from his mouth The foot kept overflowing, but he could not stop his roar. "Continue to laugh at you! You hate me, I know, then take this opportunity to humiliate and retaliate!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, father." The voice said softly. Her soft voice calmed the wizard king. "I used to think that I would hate you. I will be very happy when I saw you die. But now I realize that I don't hate you at all. I only feel sadness and not hatred."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadow rises and floats in front of the gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Strange people, can you fulfill your agreement with me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry... ...I don't have this power for a while..." Kim sat down on a big stone. "I am tired and weak now, there is no way to carry out your ritual. Ugly..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, okay, I know that is my promise. The promise, I will be responsible." The black cone jumped over. "Miss Shadow, I am telling you the prayer of Pluto. You are already a dead person. The reason is that it is because magic shields the feeling of Pluto. As long as you recite this prayer, your existence will immediately cause Pluto's attention. You can get rid of the big concept a dozen times."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there such a thing?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know, but it should be okay." Wu cone responded impatiently. It began to recite some complicated and complicated sentences and let the shadows learn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Carne Benier... Non-Dahua Louis... Well, repeat all the things I just taught you!" The cone is not a A qualified teacher, it quickly ended this teaching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a minute...Una..." The sorcerer’s voice screamed. He had been lying still for a while, letting others forget his existence. Hoofley has no violent anger at all. In fact, his eyes have already shown signs of stagnation - which shows that he has already reached the end of his life. "Don't leave me... I was wrong. I was blinded by the demon, I was deceived by him and made something that hurts you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Father... ..." The shadow is close to the side of the wizard king, and the voice is full of sorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't leave me..." The wizard king frantically held out a hand and grabbed it in the void. This hand crossed the shadow of the body more than once, but nothing could be caught. "The demon betrayed me... He used my desire to get strength to seduce me... I was wrong, my daughter, I made a sorry for you... I changed you to a ghost... Forgive me, my daughter..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have forgiven you, father." The shadow seems to be crying. However, she can't cry anymore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have committed this sin." But why can the real mastermind stay in a safe place and enjoy the joy... Why is this world so? Unfair..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you know it is wrong, then tell us what the name of the guy is, where to live, we will go looking for his suffocation. "The black cone jumped forward and asked aloud." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He doesn't live on this continent... He lives on the dark continent far from the sea...he..." Hoofley's voice suddenly ended. The call of the shadow also affected him, and Pluto took away the life he had left. He is already a dead person under the jurisdiction of Pluto. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To get through the sea." Kim looked at the body on the ground with some frustration. Even if it is a wizard king, it is no different from ordinary people after dying. Hofferly put one hand on the chest, the other hand was hanging half-powered, and the five fingers were half loose and half tight, as if to grab something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he didn’t catch anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do we want to help him build a grave?" Kim asked the black cone with a weak voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Throw him back to the hole you climbed out." "The ruins of a city... This is the mausoleum for the Witch King."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden did. He dragged the body of the wizard king with almost no weight, threw it into the pit he had just climbed out, and then filled it back. After doing all this, he sat down again and leaned back against the stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gold, how are you?" The black cone finally understood that Kim was not right. "You look terrible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's really bad. The emperor is really embarrassing..." Kim untied his chest. Hidden under the intact clothes is not a complete and uncut body, an indescribable darkness is spread over his skin like a spider web. "If you want to knock down me at all costs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is just a foolish human..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Right, I think of one thing. He said things about the Light and the Holy Grail... What is going on?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"History and The truth... there are a lot of differences." The black cone replied in a thoughtful tone. "It’s just like memory is not necessarily reliable. What I know, maybe not necessarily the truth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"哎...It looks like our journey is over There is still no time left." Kim no longer pursued, changed the subject. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A strange shadow covers the sun. Then the girl with the wings flew down like the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Found you!" The night wind stopped at Kim's side, and she noticed what the band was, so she was surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened...as if the whole city was broken and thrown here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "It's right." Wu cone sighed and replied. "It is indeed broken and thrown here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where is the Witchmaster?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Dead, here is his grave..." Kim pointed to one side. "His magic finally ruined him. Right, how are those poisoned people?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing. The sorcerer’s king is not violent, but paralyzed. Sexual poison. Xi Na helped them to return to normal after treatment. We went to see it in the morning, but found that the whole city has disappeared... It should be said that it was completely removed." The crack in the rock looked inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Night Wind..." Jin Shen stunned, but he felt that it was time to end. "You have taken me to Thousand Lakes. I think..." He wants to say "We broke up from now on," but the night wind suddenly hugged his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s really a wizard king...he is dead!" The winged girl’s arm hangs on the neck of Kim and makes him breathless. "We actually defeated a wizard king... We are heroes now!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"English...hero?" The black cone sent two sounds, immediately I was caught in the night wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Witcher King, but we teamed up to defeat!" She stared at the black cone with a fierce look. "Do you understand? We are heroes now!" Her gaze let the black cone suck a cold breath and nod. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The last magic of the wizarding king ruined himself and hurt the gold." The black cone quickly explained. "The madman actually used a curse. A magic ruined the entire city and himself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not very serious." Kim added. I don't know why, after being disturbed by the night wind, at least I just want to say that the atmosphere of the farewell was destroyed. He could not say the words of the breakup. However, this does not seem to matter - there are still many opportunities for farewell. It is not a bad thing to be with the night wind for the time being. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know that the wizard kings are mad. The madman will kill himself sooner or later." The night wind once again glanced at the corpse of the wizard king from the crack. The face of the wizard king did not suffer any harm, so the appearance was very clear. "Let's go back first. Everyone is waiting for my news."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go back first, I need to organize my feathers well."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The news of the destruction of Thousand Lakes and the death of the Witch King, even if you can't say that you have inserted your wings, at least you have already had Scuds. In just one day, all the villages within the jurisdiction of Thousand Lakes City, all the towns already know the news. The rebel army eliminated the sorcerer's king and was passed down to the gods. This attitude of the people to the Wizarding King was known to everyone when Kim arrived in the first village. In fact, this attitude is probably no different for all humans on the entire continent. All people hate the wizard king, but suffer from the power to fight against them, so they have to be patient. Hoofley itself is an extremely excessive one among the wizard kings. Therefore, it is easy to understand how happy people are when they hear and are convinced of this news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original people even hated the rebel army, and the abomination was also distorted by the hatred of the wizard king. Now, when the Wizarding King died, people immediately regarded the Resistance as a hero. The rebels also feel that it is necessary to have a meeting in this case, let everyone decide the future and fate of this land together. It is necessary to explain in advance that Qianhu City is not a mountainous area that is generally poor and not eye-catching. On the one hand, there are a lot of business trips in the area (otherwise there is no need to build such a good road). It is a shortcut to cross the mountainous area to the south. On the other hand, this area is rich in mineral resources. It produces a variety of precious metals including gold. After the wizard king came here, for the convenience of his own, the people were forbidden to mine. But now that the wizard king is dead, this ban naturally goes into the grave with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result of this kind of reason is that more than 10,000 people participated in the ruins of the original Qianhu City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A lot of people." The black cone sighed on the shoulder of Kim. It was only three days, and there were so many people gathered. It seems that the death of the wizard king is a good thing for anyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the ruins of the original Thousand Lakes City (here destroyed by the curse is extremely thorough, except for a few wall debris, the other basics are left white) Thousands of tents were built. People gathered here from all directions to turn the ruins into a new town. The savvy local merchants opened hundreds of stalls and took advantage of people's joy to make money. Everyone believes that this is just the beginning, and the days will be better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Hoofley I came here, people didn’t know much about the wizard, at least not very vigilant. The price of this slack is more than a hundred years of slavery and pain. But from now on, this kind of thing will not happen again. Just as a few places within the sphere of human power that are not ruled by the wizarding king, people are extremely sensitive to things like magic wizards. The encounter of Kim in the town of Yinye clearly illustrates this fact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gold!" A crisp voice came. Jin Instinct went back and saw a strange girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Call me?" Kim looked around to see if it was the same name, but he immediately determined that the target of this stranger was himself. Because those eyes are watching him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's the ice blue." The black cone patted on his head. "You really are...no vision."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ice Blue?" If it’s not a black cone reminder, Kim probably can’t imagine the girl and the impression in front of him. There is any overlap in the ice blue. He remembers that the ice blue dress is very casual, completely for the convenience of the dress, but now she actually put on the skirt. Kim was the first to carefully observe the face of ice blue. Although the bloodlines of the higher elves are thin, they still leave a deep feature to the ice blue. The delicate contour lines of the face and the small rosy lips are perfectly matched, and they are full of youthful vitality. Her temperament blends the charm of humanity with the elegance of a tall goblin. Gold felt for the first time that no matter which angle, ice blue can be regarded as a rare beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is there anything? Miss Ice Blue?" The black cone opened the mouth instead of Kim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you borrow to speak?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold followed ice blue to a no one space. This girl with a high leprechaun pedigree opened her mouth in a long tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When I was defeated by the wizard king's magic, the person who saved me was you? I only had a vague consciousness at that time." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you don't have the blood of the higher goblins, you have already fainted." Wu cone answered. "The sorcerer's smog is quite fierce. The temperament of the high genie makes you more resistant than the average person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The..." Laugh, suddenly cut the core. "Is it yours to defeat the Wizarding King?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope so too." In the face of such problems, Kim stayed and decided to choose a skillful honest. He smiled bitterly. "It was his master who killed the wizard king, a guy who claimed to be the great emperor. He destroyed the whole city with magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh?" Kim's answer Big out of ice and blue unexpected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now there is no wizard king here..." After a short period of time, the ice blue opened again. "I believe that this will be a very good place... a very beautiful place..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I also believe." Kim replied with a smile. "When I am passing by here next time, it must be much better than this time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gust of wind blew, with a pleasant cool caress The bare skin of the two. Something in the ice blue has slowly disappeared, and she made a long sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the meeting just held, all the people unanimously elected me as the new leader." She changed the subject. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After all, you are leading the Rebels, this is normal. People need heroes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I... I don't intend to accept it. Because I am not a good person to lead others... If you don't have them, most of us will be made into a grievance tower... Others are just lingering... I... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold gently stopped her with one finger to continue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You were not wrong that day. You made the right choice," he said. "That's not an adventure, it's a necessary risk. The things that day are not what you can know, can be avoided. In fact, in my opinion, although you are very young, you are really suitable as a leader. Because, He continued. "Power is a responsibility and burden for you. It is really suitable for you to be a lord to rule this belt. When I come next time, it should be richer and more beautiful than now. And people should also be on the passengers. More enthusiastic. No longer use the sword and doubtful eyes to entertain me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha..." Ice blue laughed, everything was hidden Under the laughter. "So, let's make this appointment. When you come here next time, you will welcome you with more prosperity and enthusiasm. Where are you going next?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Probably still want to continue south."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the ice blue left, the black cone smiled and opened his mouth. "She has a crush on you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Which degree of goodwill?" Gold asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Probably only to admire. You told her to accompany you on chuang, she is not willing now, but if you want to kiss her, she will be very happy to accept "The black cone is a serious answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh... don't make a joke. But, the black cone, since we have all the things, I think we should set off."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Starting, go now? Good idea. But your body now... It will take a few months to recover... We might as well go to the southern plateau. Let the night wind lead the way, Go to the territory of the winged people. When you are completely restored, go to the dark continent to find the great emperor. The hands of the emperor will grow longer and will not grow beyond the winged people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"I am really happy that you have this idea." Wu cone said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold began to walk outside the temporary camp. As I said before, there are so many people, so they left the temporary town without causing anyone to pay attention. He walked along the road and disappeared from the people's field of vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several people walked along the mainland to face gold. These people are pushing the car and it looks like a small trader. They didn't pay much attention to gold, but they discussed the issue enthusiastically while walking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold let the road open, the words of these people drifted into his ears with the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...so bad, everyone is killed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course The Orc originally wanted to capture it. After the Wizarding King was killed by the Glorious Master, there was no resistance to the Orcs. The Orcs sent a large army to attack, and the offensive was very fierce. After the war lasted for a few months, the city finally fell. All the living people have been killed... Only a few people have escaped, and the number has heard that there are fewer than twenty people..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small As the traders went further and further, the voice could not be heard. Kim stood alone and looked at the back of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't be like this, that is the result of your bloody moments." The black cone took a look at Kim's face. "I have taught you that things have two sides. It is not a good thing to get rid of the wizard king..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Found it!" A voice interrupted the words of the black cone. The night wind rushed down from the sky and scared the black cone to the back of Kim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Night Wind?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where does one think of going?" The long gun turned a half circle and placed a threatening posture in front of Kim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't want to go anywhere, just go out and turn around... I want to leave." Kim stunned and finally said the truth. "There is no such thing as me. It doesn't make sense to stay. At the celebration, there is no need to arrange the location of this traveler."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I hope to travel with us." The night wind said very seriously. "I feel that they can help us together with them." She took it for granted that she was a gold travel companion. She did not expect that the original agreement between them had been terminated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course we are very happy. The little girl's cooking skills are quite good." The black cone replied before Kim came to answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wu cone..." Jin Xiaosheng's reminder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter, maybe this is an opportunity." The black cone patted the golden face with his wings. "Maybe you can use the little girl to sell your personal feelings to Leica... As long as you make up the last link... the method of returning to the soul can be complete."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Is there a relationship between man and God that can 'sell a face'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't try to know?" Eyes. "Teach her the knowledge we have mastered... In any case, it will only benefit the world without harm."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The late autumn has arrived. The trees on either side of the mountain road began to show a yellowish color. From time to time, a cool breeze hit, with fallen leaves on the trees to the pedestrians on the mountain road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four seemingly small and lonely figures walked on the avenue. Go south along the winding mountain road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold stopped and looked back to the other side of the mountain. The mountains obscured his view - he had already gone too far. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ice Blue...will probably become a new leader?" Kim whispered to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It should be like this, she does have the charm of leading others. But I suspect she has not found this. But this is a good thing and will make her work harder. Study... she will become a good leader. Then she will get married, have children, and keep the memory of you forever in a corner of her heart. Maybe at the time of her death, she will remember the accidental encounter, help She is a handsome wizard who confronts the wizard king... Isn't this the best ending for her?" Wu cone replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, your long is really not bad." Wu cone laughed. "I said, you are too tender. You will understand what a terrible thing in the world, 'eternal'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, I really I want to pass the method of returning the soul to the great emperor, let him enjoy the eternal emptiness after a short enjoyment! Let him always regret his pursuit!" Ubuntang started, added. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But people are emptiness to the limit... Probably they will conceive plans to destroy the whole world?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "It's true... hahahahahaha..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold turned and rushed forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Author's Note:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;1, night wind. What is the identity of the night wind? This is the beginning of the following. The author can only reveal that the identity of the night wind is not ordinary (please don't yell at me, I know this design is very tacky). As for her image, the first is the dead end of the black cone. Many people look at the bird is not good, the night wind can help you deal with the bird. Her main shape is the evaluation of the black cone "a shrew with wings and no chest". Although she is very self-centered, she is still a very good person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2, ice blue. The girl who was originally the blood of this elf is dying, but for various reasons (mainly because many people say that I am murderous, the reputation problem has to be compromised) to let her survive. Then make a shadow lady to die for her. In short, it is unlikely that she will be involved again in the future. Unless the author is hot for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3, Xi Na and no moon. The combination of these two people is very weird. Wu cone said that no moon is a wizard, but no moon actually has no grievance tower. They naturally have a good story to tell... so let's talk about it below. Xi Na is a very caring girl, cooking and sewing, and so on. In short, it is very suitable to go home as a wife, a good wife and a good mother. Ability is also an auxiliary treatment. She does not have the power to fight. The strength of no moon is quite strong. She is a kind of intelligent woman full of mystery, and it is the kind of reason that is better than emotion. She is the deepest and most dangerous of all of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4, Wizard King. After the end of this chapter, everyone should have a good understanding of the wizard king. As a friend said, the Wizarding King is a "promising career." In short, the wizard king is a magician with unlimited magic. Please imagine the games you have played yourself. Unlimited unlimited use of the magic of the strongest magician. The concept of the Witch King and the Wraith Tower comes from three aspects, namely, “Holocaust Remnant”, “No Dead Warrior”, “GS – Bliss Battle”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5, the protagonist. Some friends reflected that the protagonist was indecisive. This is exactly what I want to show. Gold is swaying from side to side. In dealing with others, the black cone is constantly reminding and controlling the gold. And Kim is not willing to accept every opinion of the black cone. The reason for conceiving this protagonist is to discuss with you on QQ "How will people get the invincible power in the world?" I have always looked down on those plots that suddenly met a master to pass on his life skills or eat any elixir. Although these things look very cool, they simply cannot stand up to scrutiny. I prefer to give a master a lifelong skill, and then force the protagonist to complete such an unfortunate situation. Strength and obligation are indivisible. Someone said that gold is a personal scum, he should unite mankind to build another magic dynasty. To be honest, if I did write this, and wrote it down seriously, the result would be no different from the last magic dynasty. After a curse war, human civilization was destroyed. Although I am not a pessimist, logically, it seems that this is the only ending. If you let gold as the ruler of eternal life not let this happen, the result will be similar to that of Yan Wang in the 12 countries. When Kim is tired of everything, he will want to destroy everything. Including this world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6, the Great. The role of the Great is derived from the "Sorcerer's Legend." Those who have played should know a little. In short, as a member of humanity, the Emperor will not emerge as freely as the Sayādaw. As human beings, there are weaknesses. The emperor is more inclined to plan rather than violent to fight against Kim (in fact, the author seems to be Kim and he is right). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7, half-orc. Is the war between the half-orcs and humans over? The answer is no. War is also an exchange. It is not a strange thing for mankind to go to the territory of the Orcs and the half-orcs to come to the territory of mankind. Due to the existence of the wizard king, the half-orc attacked mankind, and the ambition to recapture the northern territories has not been successful yet. The war is a stale war. But at present, the author has not conceived the storyline of the half-orc again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
