After the catastrophe of the undead war, the fading Reiter empire could not withstand the attacks of the nations, retreat and lose a large territory. At that time, the emperor finally moved to the capital after a strong enemy repeatedly violated the situation and the war situation was extremely unfavorable. He built a new city on the site of an ancient city in the eastern dynasty of the mainland. Never sleep in the city. In the process of building the city, some magicians accidentally discovered that some ancient magical devices that were part of the ancient city site could be used, so they were slightly trimmed to serve the new town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ancient ruins of these automatic lighting are the cause of the name "Never Night City", and these devices will shine under the control of the magician whenever the night falls. Provide lighting for the city. This spectacle of ancient magic is enough to make everyone who arrives in the city for the first time marvel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the city was just built, there was a big man who lamented: "Maybe this spectacle will be the cause of the fall of this city, because such things will inevitably cause The sight of a strong enemy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the days of holding this worry are over. Since the emperor Victor has been enthroned, this ancient empire has begun to renew its vitality under his wise rule. Both military and economic forces have greatly improved and changed the past. The weak posture began to expand strongly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it was not possible to completely eliminate the Red Alliance in the last war, in the name, the Alliance has already yielded and tribute to the Victor Emperor, so Said to be a complete victory. And now the city that never sleeps is the capital of such an emerging empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The six people stood on a mountain and looked far away at the only shining area in the night. The bright and soft light makes the city look so beautiful, and the "Never Night City" is truly true. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's so beautiful, I have been touched by Shao for many times and will be touched by her beauty...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ..." Lev said to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s beautiful...just like the pearls shining in the night sky!” Elna whispered, “The first time I saw such a beautiful city...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How beautiful is not half of yours..." Behan was naturally close to the therapist, gently, but inevitably heard by many people. Said the voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Elna didn’t appreciate it and walked away gently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How are we going to the night?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To be honest, in the half-orc wilderness, the adventurers really did not notice that the physical strength of the old Locke is so good. Today, under the proposal of Lao Locke, they climbed a whole mountain in order to copy the road, but now the old man is still fascinating, and he does not reveal the tiredness he should have at this age. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adventurers have been away for a month, and the road went very smoothly. Under the leadership of the old man who claimed to travel all over the mainland, they did not have any A similar thing when border towns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't you..." Lev took a few steps to get to the old Locke. "We are camping on this mountain tonight!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The young people are really not good now, and they can't afford to go so far..." Old Locke shook his head and sighed, but did not oppose Lev's proposal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the six seemingly insignificant, the world has a lot of adventurers on the mountain that is two days away from the "Never Night City" When the fire was arranged and the tent was arranged, the door of the "Never Night City" was opened. An unusually luxurious carriage drove out from the gate. A horseman of a hundred people was surrounded by the carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The average car is a single horse, a little better is two horses, the noble nobles use four horses, but this carriage uses eight With the skill of the coachman, the carriage and the surrounding cavalry maintain a constant distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His age does not seem to be more than thirty years old, but his hand is very difficult to use at this age<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has a magic wand, which means he The identity of the great magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Send it here, Bled!" Another person showed a head from the car, an old man about five or sixty years old. Although he called the other person "adult", but there is not much respect in the tone, "I will go back if I go back!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good "Bright made a farewell gesture. "Mr. Fas, you go slowly!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a soldier next to a horse, young magic The teacher immediately turned over. The man inside the carriage voluntarily waved his hand outside the window and urged the driver to hurry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the gutter's screaming, eight horses twirled in four hooves and left in a burst of smoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Fasher," after a long period of silence in the silence, the groom asked the owner inside the car, "The Brett...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you think of him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A young and powerful mage...a rare talent So young, but with such a powerful force... is a genius!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last sentence seems to be biting his teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the groom asked: "Adult, do you want to go back to the temple right away, or go to the place you said first?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Back to the Temple!" The man in the car ordered in an unquestionable tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The six people finally arrived at the door of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, in the daytime, the city is not only prosperous, but also has no difference with other cities..." Behan looked sillyly. City wall. In fact, the city is very good, just because the night scene left a strong and too good impression in their hearts, so the situation during the day could not help but make them a little disappointed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the most disappointing is the magician. Kim originally thought that there would be a chance to look at the magic device that can shine permanently. You can study it well. Unfortunately, these glowing pillars have guards carefully guarded, let alone study it carefully. . This made Kim disappointed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We will temporarily separate," walked in the city for a while, and the old Locke suddenly stopped and said to the big move: "I have something to look for." An old friend of the past, you lived in the "outsiders' hotel" in the south of the city. Rest assured, I will come to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man patted the shoulders of gold As soon as I turned around, I entered a small alley and quickly disappeared. The remaining adventurers continued to follow the avenue. What makes them strange is that the city gate is empty, and no one can see it. It seems that people have gone somewhere to hold a rally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right," said Behan, a few steps before he ran. He said to Kim: "Why do you tell Old Locke to bring us here?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What should be the task..." The golden heart is not answering, he is thinking about how to create a permanent lighting magic, especially to be able to control the lighting freely. The intensity of magic and does not require regular maintenance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It won't be a good thing, especially if you don't have money to take..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;columns The husband snorted, but Elna gave him a look and he swallowed the rest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is no old Locke, I am afraid that they have already become a dead body now - compassion is not the nature of a half-orc. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold is at the forefront, he is thinking about the problem of lighting, the complex principle needs to concentrate his full attention, so he did not notice himself Already at the corner of the street, I didn’t even hear the hustle and bustle of cheers and cheers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It hurts..." The magician finally got rid of his magical ideas and touched the real world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Welcome to you... friends from afar:" The drunkard has climbed up and hugged the nearest Lev with open arms. "Welcome to this celebration." The moment came to "Never Night City"... oh..." He made a wine cellar, "Celebrate together... Celebrate our generous emperor and his unparalleled wine... 隔<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......" He alternately embraced these strangers while playing wine, and he did not do anything when it was the only woman. It seems that it is just a person who is drunk at a festive rally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five people walk around the corner, in front of the city's central square, but now, this square, which should have been empty, is almost filled: men, women , old people, children. Squeezed into piles of piles, watching the performances of the artists; the car with the big barrels slowly passed through the crowd, freely distributing beer and ale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not just this square, in fact, except for a few streets, the carnival crowd has spread throughout the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey! Uncle!" Lev struggled to squeeze into the tightly-circled wine cart, taking over a beer belly and red face. The middle-aged man handed over a beer and asked: "What day is it today? It’s so lively!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Today is the day when our emperor is overjoyed... "The man only said half, and another voice interrupted him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Boss, come back again! The gods are on, your dark beer is really delicious!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Toast for the uncle's health of such a good wine!" Lev said aloud, holding up the cup in his hand and drinking it, this move set off another drink of drinking, people have Lift the cup and lift your head. Lev took advantage of this opportunity to get out of the crowd and return to the side of the partners. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; said that they are waiting for Lev’s news, in fact they are all around the crowd watching a dancer’s performance. With the cheerful music of the bard, the young dancers danced, and the light and graceful dance won people's applause. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How was the inquisition?" After Lev slammed his cuff, Kim noticed that Lev was back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It looks like a grand event to hold money, nothing more!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I I think we should have fun before we start looking for a hotel!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leif also remembered the fresh and refreshing beer just now, there is nothing wrong with it. Do it well, or take the opportunity to enjoy this rare event! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will go to the hotel reservation room first." Wei Jing, who has been very silent along the way, opened his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of you are a little surprised. These days, the partners have vaguely felt that this warrior has changed a bit. If he was only silent before, then this time is simply gloomy. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When walking, his eyes always look at the unknown distant place. When he is resting, he always looks at him quietly. The sword, looking over and over, looked at the demon sword that had been used for a long time. The companions talked to him. He didn't answer the question, he was absent-minded, and sometimes he treated it silently. Just now, when everyone was enjoying the wonderful dance of the dancer, he was also like this. Although his eyes looked at the front, the focal length was not aimed at the dancers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There must be something that everyone doesn't know." Everyone thought so, but no one said it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." This proposal, Lev, has no objection, because considering such a big festival, it is very possible that the hotel is full. What's wrong, "Is your money enough?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Enough," Wei replied simply, turned and squeezed out the crowd, passing the gold side I said a little more at the time: "I am waiting for you at the hotel, you use magic to find me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." The magician unconsciously Give Way. Wei’s eyes are now mixed with new fire, something that the magician can’t understand, but his instinctive village is dangerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People have retreated in front of the soldiers, so Wei did not have to pay anything to get around the crowd. Because in this festival, they also wear locks and swords are all security personnel, to maintain the festival order and prevent the thief from taking this opportunity to make a big deal. However, there are still a few people who notice that there is no Leite royal mark on Wei's lock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come on! Come!" A burst of cheers came from far away, and the crowd fluctuated like a wave, squeezing from the center of the street to the street. . Everyone is desperately squeezing and leaning back. Under this pressure, even Wei can't avoid being pushed into the crowd. The armor on his body gives him the only advantage <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a little easier to squeeze than others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majestic guard of honor opened the road ahead, the front is the flag bearer, the rear is the cavalry, followed by the infantry, the uniform is gorgeous, the movements are neat. Some of the soldiers wore armor with royal symbols, that is, the famous sword and the rose crossed the royal family's emblem on one side of the shield, while the other part of the soldier wore the badge of the eagle and the factory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold while eating the little cake provided by the rabbit, while watching the team walk in rows and rows. Although the cake is really delicious, the magician can't taste it now. After I noticed the change of Wei, he suddenly found that he had lost half of his fun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd is too crowded, the partners have no way to stay together, Wei left less than twenty minutes, four people have completely dispersed, at least gold and other People have been dispersed! "Forget it, it is impossible to find someone in this environment. Anyway, there should be no problem now. j<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey: Let the opening point ! "A polite voice came over. Some people suspected that Kim had blocked his way to get the cake. The magician let go to the side, and then looked back at the team that was on the move...<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person sitting on the horse’s back glanced at the sight of Jin’s head. When the two items touched each other, both sides were taken aback and immediately recognized each other! Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cake fell from the mouth of Kim, and Bright, sitting on the horse's back, couldn't help but blink, for fear that he was wrong!<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is Bright? How is he here? In the impression of Kim, Bly. It should be in Dicco, and, of course, a member of the Orc Crusade How could he be here, and in the marching team, riding a high horse.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is the gold that the muscles grow into the brain? How can he Here? Bright is very clear, this guy is dying on the island of Undead! He is seeing the Sayādaw The only zombie mage who sheltered them, after the death of Wolf, the undead wizards who hate the living will never let them live away from the Undead Island. But now he appears in front of himself and is still eating cake! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold turned his head and staggered his eyes. Brett’s eyes changed from a first horror to a mixture of arrogance and hatred.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I don’t know why, but Kim knows that Brett has absolutely no goodwill to himself. In fact, since they were classmates at the School of Magic, Bright has always shown that he wants to swallow him. The appearance of .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although in the heart of Kim, they can only be regarded as "bad relationship" at most.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp The music began to sound, and the second part of the parade - the band and the dancers appeared. Under the maintenance of a small number of soldiers, the people on the streets were quite cooperative, so that the middle of the road could be empty. Point, after a wave of fluctuations, people It was still, and it was more crowded than before.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horse followed the team at the original speed, only turning around, the one looks like a bull. The magician disappeared into the crowd and couldn't find it anymore. But it didn't matter, Brett's face showed a smile, he already knew that Kim was still alive, and he was now "no night city", only need these two points Enough, with his current status and power, it is not a problem to find a humble adventurer in the "Never Night City". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The golden short strolled for a while and then stood up straight. He was very pleased to see that Brett was moving away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a crowd of people, it is impossible to find a deliberately hiding figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There should be a bride sitting inside!" Kim thought, he did not appreciate the gorgeous carriage and the beautiful maids around like the crowd around him. He just looked at him absently, and he still speculated that Wei Yinyu was in his head. The reason and how to deal with Bright's problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A light breeze blew. The satin curtains hanging on the wagon window were picked up, and the magician's swept gaze fell on the face of the girl sitting in the car. Although it was a rush, Kim still felt that this face was a bit familiar and seemed to have seen it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now Kim is not in the mood to recall, in order to get rid of the crowds, he needs to work hard to crowd the crowd. After a arduous struggle, he finally squeezed into the relatively empty position behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is Bright here? This question is not so difficult to understand. When he was studying at the Magic Academy, Kim knew that Brett was a famous aristocrat, although he did not know which country was aristocrat. In this way, if he left Dick to go home, it should not be a strange thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Wei? What happened to him? The magician saw it very clearly, and the look in Wei’s eyes clearly stated that he seemed to have made some determination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go and ask him!" Kim decided to find a suitable time to ask, although it was just an intuition, but he felt Wei Wei’s look and inexplicable His eyes are proof that he is going to do a stupid thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers are crowded into the crowd. Although his original plan was to find a hotel, he could only follow the crowd. Unconsciously, he followed the crowd to the second square near the palace hall. It belongs to the palace. It was originally not allowed to come in, but it was exceptionally open on this festive day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd cheers for a while, everyone is trying to squeeze forward and want to see her when the bride gets off. In this case, even with the help of the pre-set railings, the soldiers responsible for the order are still a little helpless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ceremonial team lined up on both sides, the band played behind the guard of honor, the luxurious royal carriage drove to the gate of the palace, in the eyes of a man, a man in a dress Come out from the palace and welcome the bride from the carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but anyone who knows a little insider knows that this man is not the groom, he is the groom's brother. It is said that the Emperor Max was seriously injured in the last war. Now he can't get out of bed. Now he has to replace him with his brother Hunt to welcome the bride. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whistle began to appear from the crowd, and some boring men expressed their inclination to the bride's appearance in this way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bride is not very expensive, and there is not much luxury jewelry on her body. The most attractive thing for her is the set of crystal jewellery hanging on the neck and wrist of the white enamel. The crystal clear crystals in the sun, each slight angle change will lead to different radiance of the crystal. The set of jewellery was specially made by the Entrusted Magic Academy and was called "Rainbow Sea". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bride raised a hand and handed it to the man who greeted her. When the wrist was active, there was a burst of colorful fluctuations on the bracelet, "scalding"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of every present person. The crowd could not help but make a whisper of envy and jealousy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei did not respond to this jewellery that was enough to dazzle anyone. In fact, he did not notice the jewelry at all. He stared at the bride with a blank face, his face was so pale, it was like a zombie coming out of the grave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is absolutely impossible to be wrong, that bride... is Mink!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One day The carnival is finally over! The crowd began to slowly dissipate with the laughter and talk of satisfaction, and today’s carnival will become the content of the masses’ conversations for a long time. From time to time, some people and relatives who were drunk and unable to climb because they drank too much free alcoholic beverages were pulled up and taken away. Finally, even the uninhabited drunkards were taken away by the security personnel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no one is going to pull Wei, although the difference between him and the drunk is that the latter is lying and the former is standing. He stood in the square as if he had been petrified for a long time. For a long time, when the people around him went almost, he still stood there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei has a very confident self-confidence. From a young age, he began to work hard to become a qualified warrior. At Shao, his eyes will never be dereliction of duty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three or four people who are discussing today’s carnival walked past the soldiers, one of them accidentally hit Wei’s body, this unexpected blow He returned to reality from the state of ecstasy. He subconsciously turned around and began to walk outside the square with a mechanical footstep. The stiff action could make people misunderstand that he was a magical statue that would move around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold walks around the street and looks around, although in theory it is not very difficult to find someone who dresses like Wei, but actually it’s another one. It’s going on. The magician has been on the street for a long time, but still has not seen the target. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn!" Kim couldn't help but snorted. He overestimated himself and actually believed that he could use magic to locate a person in a city with a population of hundreds of thousands. The only clue he can use to trace it is the armor that Wei attached to his magic. However, there are a lot of magic items in this city. When the magician uses the tracking magic for the fourth time, but finds the magical jug that is automatically heated in the store, he gives up the idea of ​​continuing to use magic and uses his eyes. Come to find a companion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have found the hotel. Things went very smoothly. When the crowd started to disperse, the magician and other companions at the "outsiders hotel"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; met at the door, the old Locke’s recommendation was really good, This hotel is really comfortable and cheap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after waiting for a long time, the warrior who should go to the hotel first did not see the figure, the companions began to worry, I don’t know that the recent abnormal warriors will be strangers here. What happens in the city, what will happen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more and more bad speculations. Finally, everyone finally can't sit still and agree to go out and look for it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei’s figure appeared in the sight of the magician, although there were many people, but Kim immediately found the tall figure of the warrior. The magician felt a happy moment. Since Wei was on the street, it meant that he had no trouble. He quickly passed through the crowd and ran over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, I finally found you." Kim patted Wei’s shoulder hard, and the palm of his hand took the armor and it was very loud. Where have you been? We are all worried..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician’s words stopped, and he found the place where the soldiers were not right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Wei, what's the matter with you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing!" leaned down Slamming loudly, the soldier finally recovered from his embarrassing state, and he tried to squeeze a smile from his face. Although he tried his best to cover up, how could he get through the eyes of Kim? Kim is a magician who has been trained in countless illusions. He has long learned to ignore the expression on his face and see people through his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is really nothing!" Wei smiled again. The magician also hangs his eyes to cover the eyes of the inquiry. He knows that he must respect the opinions of others. Since Wei does not intend to say it, there must be reasons for not saying it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What am I doing? Why is it so irritating and uncomfortable? Yes, the bride is indeed Ming Ke is not wrong, but what does it have to do with me? Is it true that? Is there some expectation in my heart? Impossible...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Impossible... For her, I am nothing, just an accident and her The people who met each other... Damn! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei Yiquan waved to the side, hit the wall next to it, let a clear punch appear on the innocent wall mark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A full day of royal weddings made everyone very tired, and after dinner, everyone went to bed. Old Locke still didn't appear, but no one paid attention to it. It was a wonderful night. Everyone should take a day's tiredness and lie in a comfortable bed to prepare for a dream. At least most people in this city think so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"叩叩叩..." The sound of a knock on the door came, and the rush of the voice seemed to indicate the anxiousness of the knocker, and Lev reluctantly opened the door. Then I saw the person outside the door who he didn't want to see at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Old gentleman, now when you are sleeping, we haven't slept for a long time - so late, may I ask you what is the matter?" The thief made the last struggle, especially emphasizing the words "have not been for a long time", trying Cause the sympathy of the other party, so as to drive away the upcoming bad luck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he saw the face of the old Locke, he knew what the old man was going to do, but for the current Lev, he really wanted to sleep well. feel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course I want you to take part in this evening's action! Get ready, I am waiting for you in the hall!" Old Locke smashed the smashing of Lev. A glimmer of hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lev sighed and reluctantly walked back to the bed and began to pack his gear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Leif put his new leather arm out, several people were already waiting in the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This leather was bought when the last few valuable things were sold. The old one was painted because of several big cracks. Can no longer wear it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go!" said Old Locke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about other people?" Lev looked around, neither Elna nor Behan appeared. Only magicians and fighters and old Locke were here. I am it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This time it doesn't take everyone to go! Four will be enough," Old Locke said. Lev looked at the two closed doors and sighed with a sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are we going to do? Where are we going?" After leaving the door, Lev asked Old Locke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although they have already set off, they still don’t know the destination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold seems to have a strong trust in this old man, Wei Zeyi has a lot of thoughts, and the two seem to care less about this almost the most important issue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"An important thing," Old Locke said, the attitude is almost exactly the same as when they first met. "Go, let me go." I know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tonight's "Never Night City" is very quiet, which is very rare in peacetime. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the daytime carnival, people’s energy has almost been exhausted. There are very few pedestrians in the streets at night, and even if several people accidentally encounter this four-person combination, they will not be suspicious. In the Warcraft turmoil of a while ago, there have been many new adventurers, and the number of people engaged in this line has expanded to an unprecedented number. It is not a strange thing to encounter a few in this bustling capital. All this made Lev feel very relaxed and even a little happy, after all, this feeling has not appeared for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three people are behind the old Locke, this old man is now walking at a speed that is obviously not the age of the age, so that the young people behind him feel a bit Hard work. Sometimes Lev really couldn't understand what the old man's body was made of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking along, Lev suddenly found that his emotions began to get nervous, and the old man was in a hurry, obviously urgency, and urgent Another way of saying that a risky person is a dangerous person is that it is dangerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the time, the group went out of the city and went to a hillside on the outskirts of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The moonlight tonight is very good!" Old Locke looked at the sky and said it, then turned to face Kim, "Young man, put your wand Lend me a little!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah...good!" Kim handed the wand over, although he didn't know what Old Locke wanted for this thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This wand has no other specificity other than the age of creation and the magical power that is said to be in the wand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Locke took the cane, looked at it carefully, then sat down with satisfaction, and then he put the wand firmly into the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flow of white appears in the place where the wand is in contact with the ground, which is small at first, but spreads out immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Transportation!" Old Locke replied, "One of the sites left by the Holy Light Dynasty, but it can still be used!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Transportation Gate?" An incredulous expression looks at the white energy flow that has spread all over the hill. Now these energies have formed a lot of complicated words and symbols that he has never seen before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What makes him even more surprised is that during the entire process of this magical array, Old Locke did not do anything, and did not use any magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Locke looked at Kim’s expression and laughed. “Young, you feel very strange?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It...what is it going on?" Kim looked at the magic array that was clearly completed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, at the center of the entire magical array, that is, at the top of this hillside, there is a hollow that looks very awkward, and Kim knows that this is an instant transfer class. The core of magic - the fault of space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a special kind of magic that uses the Earth Elf to bring together the magical array of power. This magic can only be applied to specific locations, and the target of the transfer is only special. Location.” Old Locke smiled. “So, part of it is used as a population of secret rooms. After the magic dynasty collapsed, this magic disappeared into history, and you don’t know it’s normal.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Chamber of Secrets?" The spirit of Lev was immediately uplifted, because he naturally recalled the sites that Old Locke had taken to visit in Hope City. If the old Locke is true, then this magical array may lead to an ancient aristocratic chamber, and it is likely to be a well-preserved chamber. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are talking about the secret room! Can this magic lead to a secret room?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go Just look at it!" The magician came forward to pull up his magic wand from the ground, but the old Locke blocked him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't move this, this magic array must rely on the magic wand - that is, the certificate of the nobility to run. Don't worry, there will be no one nearby, you just have to Add a hidden magic to your wand!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold begins to meditate on the prayer, adding a common hiding to the cane standing on the ground magic. This magic can't stop the careful exploration of the people, but no one should come here to explore this night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After completing the magic, Kim suddenly thought of a strange thing. So far, Old Locke has never used magic in front of him: Is it he...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Impossible, Jin Shantou puts this unreasonable guess from The mind rushed out. Old Locke has directed him. Imagine if it wasn't a magician who had a high attainment to magic. How could he give him such guidance? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is just an accident, it must be accidental: "Let's go!" Old Locke said as he walked to the top of the mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four figures disappeared one by one in the spatial gap that was maintained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very spacious underground cave, a bit damp, but still good, there is no uncomfortable feeling when people walk inside. The only thing that puts pressure on four people is quietness. This cave is too quiet! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The front can't see the side, as if the hole is directly connected to the other side of the world. The cave was very dark, and only a few branches of the light vines were drilled out of the cracks of some rocks, providing a little illumination. In addition to the footsteps of their own walking, they simply could not hear other voices. In such a place, it is so long that people can't help but have an urge to scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Locke! How far is it?" Lev took a few steps forward and asked the old Locke who was at the front of the team, but not so much he wanted to be old. Locke got the answer, it is better to say that he wants to use this opportunity to make a sound to make himself feel better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He began to endure some of the silence that this image will last forever, not just him, his two companions are similar. Wei constantly changes the speed of his walking, so that he can get some comfort from the sounds produced by the various parts of the armor, and the magician simply recites different prayers to escape this repressed silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, when people enter this cave, the concept of time is prone to errors. The three adventurers don’t know how long they have gone. The only thing they can do is to estimate their time from the fatigue of their legs. It has not been more than two hours. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leif retired, he came to Wei's side, trying to provoke a topic, and then not talking to people is really a bit unbearable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wei," he cried. "Do you know? I found a very strange thing during the day!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I saw the face of the emperor." Lev said a little proudly. "At the time, there was a gust of wind, and all three of us saw it. You know, the princess looks like Mink, the boy we saved in the hands of the half-orcs, but left without paying us. I At that time, I didn’t recognize it at the beginning, or the eyes of Behan’s. When he said it, I remembered it...” Leif said very happy, and did not realize the change of Wei’s face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s really like, if she is not sitting in the carriage, I will definitely treat her as Mink, maybe I will ask for the last reward. Uncertain! Hahahaha..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Minke..." Kim on the side also recalled the appearance of the teenager from his mind, and saw it today. After comparing the woman, he had to admit that Lev made a point. The two people were very similar, just like brothers and sisters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Really, I really forgot it! Right, you said," Kim looked at Lev, who turned his face. "Is that Mink? What does it have to do with the bride of the Crown Prince? The factory may be a brother and sister, maybe!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Brother and sister?" Lev laughed. "If that is the case." Just fine, I can find the door to ask for our reward. Since it is the royal family's in-laws, it must be very rich... Hahahaha... Hey, Wei, what's the matter with you?" He turned back and suddenly found out Wei’s body is shaking and his hands are tight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't talk, be careful!" The old Locke in front of him suddenly gave an alarm. "Everyone is hiding!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three people quickly responded to the alarm of Old Locke. Although this tunnel is not very large, there are still many places to hide. Almost everyone chose the same place. It is a large stone that is often prominent. It occupies almost half of the entire passage. Even if four people hide behind it, it can cover up very well. No one will find it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone’s eyes look forward together, Old Locke is right, there is a fire in front, someone is in front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team with the torches is slowly approaching, and from their messy footsteps, it can be judged that there is absolutely no more than one or two, by the fire of the other party. Kim saw the front of them about twenty meters away, there is a very obvious exit, even the moss on the steps can be seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are those?" After seeing the team that was getting closer, Wei couldn't help but whisper to the magician around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's a dwarf!" Kim whispered, although he had known that there was such a race, but it was the first time. They are probably half as high as humans, but they look very strong. What is in the hands of the dwarf is not the torch. It seems to be a kind of phosphorescent stone. The range of illumination is quite large. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Strange, why do dwarves need lighting?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold can’t help but think of this for books The introduction of the race, this race lives underground, has night vision ability, does not need lighting at all, but the reality seems to be different from what is written in the book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have come very close, and the recent ones can make these people look very clear. These dwarves were not armed. They were all unarmed, neither wearing armor nor weapons. Instead, they were obviously dressed in formal dresses. They don't look like an expedition team, but like a diplomatic mission. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone looked at the old Locke, waiting for him to take the idea, but the old Locke did not move at all, and seemed to be waiting for it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened, how did we get to the dwarf's territory?" When the dwarves went far, Jin asked the old man around him, but the old Locke was also puzzled at this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s weird, why do dwarves come here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do we do, Continue to go?" Lev asked Old Locke, although he was not very sure, but the cave did not look like a dwarf digging, too big for them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait a minute!" Old Locke said, "Let's take a break, the time is still abundant, we don't have to worry!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a bit strange. He is going to start at night. He is so anxious to walk. In the end, time is enough. Don't worry about him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden looked suspiciously at Old Locke and immediately knew that he couldn’t get anything from the old Locke, so he immediately made a smart choice. I chose a relatively dry place to sit down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All kinds of suspicions and guesses have accumulated. The magician has a vague and rough answer in his heart. He feels that Old Locke seems to be a kind of mysterious responsibility. The great responsibility that is important but no one can share. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four people sat down, and apart from Lev, they were thinking about each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This tunnel is no longer as quiet as a suffocating suffocation, the wind keeps coming, telling them that the front exit is definitely not a dead end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The screams mixed footsteps into everyone’s ears, letting the people sitting are jumping, hiding behind the stone again, and soon seeing The dwarves who had just returned were back, and they fell into the hole from the hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You will regret it!" The first dwarf who was pushed down raised his fist and threatened behind him. "If you don't return the artifact, we will Use force to seize!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you will use force to seize it! We are all scared!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Hahahaha... "With the laughter, more dwarves were pushed down violently and fell into the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adventurers then saw a human body appearing in the mouth of the passage, although only half of the body was exposed, but it was obvious that it was an armed human, holding in the hand A long beak. He is now pointing this long arm to the unarmed dwarf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get out of my way! You dirty reptiles, come here and put all of you on the fire and cook them and feed them!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that in order to prove this threat, a fireball flies behind the soldiers and explodes in the landfelt friends not far from the dwarves, although it does not cause any serious problems for the dwarves. Injury, but there are still a few dwarfs' clothes and hair that are ignited by an instant fire. They have to roll on the ground to put out the flames.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This time there is no I have given you all the luck! Fast rolling! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God! "Gold sees the old Locke around him muttering to himself. "It’s the elders group. I didn’t recognize it. It’s actually the elders’ group personally to negotiate... these idiots, they actually treat the elders in this way...<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will immediately lead to war..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time a dwarf has stood up and he looks It is the youngest and hottest of all dwarves. Red hair and red beard prove this. He jumps and threatens.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait for it. You, rude humans, we brought war and peace, and you chose war! I swear in the name of the great Ip, as long as you don't return the gems of Loding, our dwarves will fight forever with humans! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the dwarf threatened, Kim noticed that the old Locke was shaking slightly, in the memory of Kim, only in the night when the Sayādaw suddenly appeared. Old Locke has exposed this kind of superficial look, this very serious and nervous look.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
