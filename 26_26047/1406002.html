			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 01<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This change is too fast, Kim can only look at the forward Wei The Supreme was knocked down, but even if he had enough time to react, he could do nothing. The current magician can only protect himself by that strange power, and nothing else can be done. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A clear burst of sound came over, it was the voice of the Sayādaw, and Kim looked at the source of the sound. Suddenly, he found the Say In fact, it has also suffered a lot of damage, just because the cloak is blocked and can't be seen. A large pool of blood has appeared at the foot of the tall man's body. The same red blood flows down his big cloak and joins the blood pool. When he made a hand to deal with Wei who suddenly rushed over, he obviously suffered a loss in confrontation with the elders of the dragon. His body wrapped in a cloak smashed into it, as if part of the body was eliminated. It is. Obviously, the power of the dragon shattered the bones of this strange creature - at least part of the bone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Great!" The ugly voice rang again "It’s a terrible power! If it is an equal contest, I have no chance of victory. But, in this In the world, I am not dead, but you can be killed!!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon made a cry full of pain, in him The middle part of the neck suddenly burst open, and a lot of flesh and scales fell like rainstorms. Even the body of the sage was shrouded in this blood rain. Kim’s vision was obscured by the fleshy rain, but he also clearly heard the deep popping sound, which was the sound that came from the body of the Lord, and the strength of the elders of the dragon also struck this at the same time. Strong enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician is anxiously waiting for the end of this bloody rain, which should be the dawn of this battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the blood rain spurted out, one of the fallen bodies on one side had stood up with the sword. At this moment, Wei is not in an ordinary state. No matter how serious the injury is, if he does not completely destroy his body and destroy his life, there is no way to stop him from continuing to fight. In the legend, the dragon's blood has magical power. It seems that this is true, because when Wei once rushed to the Eight-Eyed Devil, the Devil did not find this attack. The blood rain covered his perception and gave Wei an opportunity to attack. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood is soaking, you can see the situation clearly, the two creatures are still facing each other, a very large wound appears on the dragon's neck, the blood is still Constantly gushing, but this wound is not fatal. Wait a minute, what is it? It was Wei. He didn't know when he stood up. He rushed over when the blood sprayed, and the long sword in his hand pierced the body of the demon. Perhaps the blood rain also hindered his sight, perhaps the restraint of his body's injury. In short, Wei's sword did not penetrate the vital chest well, but stabbed into the shoulders of the Sayādaw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a short tens of seconds of silence, the sorcerer broke out a terrible roar, louder than the dragon’s voice, full of sound The grievances and pains caused all the rocky protrusions in this cave to shake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can live alive under that terrible blow, because in the face of a powerful dragon, the sage must go all out, so in his When he had a hand to deal with the rushing warrior, he calculated it too accurately, and the power released by the sage was just enough to break the armor and his chest outside Wei. When Wei was beaten, the only thing that broke was his armor and the ropes inside. Although several bones were broken, now he finally buried the demon sword in his hand deeply into the body of the devil. Let the devil send a painful number that has never been seen before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power broke out from the body of the sage, and the black cloak was pulled into pieces of rags, and his entire body was revealed in the eyes of the magician. . The cyan fine scales, the thick and long tail, the white bloody mouth of the sword, the huge and burly body, and the unforgettable eight eyes, divided into four pairs in the head, chest, and abdomen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the painful roar, the devil uses a paw to catch the blood from the wound, and hold it tightly, the strong silver light suddenly comes from The demon king radiated out of his hand. When everyone (including the dragon) is still amazed by this change, the silver light suddenly turns into silver, and the insects wrap the dragon elder's body. The change was too fast and too sudden, and even the elders of the dragon had no time to react and were covered by the whole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil suddenly stopped screaming, and his left hand’s hand hanged down because of the attack, and he grabbed Wei’s forehead before Wei’s reaction. Lifting his body up (fortunately, this part of the scorpion still exists, so the claws can not hurt Wei), compared with the body of the demon king two meters eight, Wei's body is really the same as a child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil looked at the humans in front with a terrible gaze, and his eyes were filled with unimaginable grievances, but Wei also stared at the four eyes on the face of the demon, and his eyes contained hatred that was not inferior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei’s hands are desperately trying, but the muscles of the Devil’s muscles are very tough, the sword can be stabbed in, but there is no way to cross-cut – even Wei’s Power can't do it either. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You will pay for hurting me!" The devil is now regretting why he ignored these two humans. He always thought that the sword was there. Humans with strong mystical power, but did not expect to suddenly turn to this human hand, if you notice this sword early, the previous blow will gather the power that can shatter this human. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have already paid the price, it seems that this is not enough! Wait and see, you will be subject to greater retribution!!" At the time, the upper and lower teeth were twisted together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You didn't kill me at the beginning, it was a mistake! Going to the ends of the earth, I will find you, revenge for the relatives who died in your hands!" Wei of the state of the Berserker, this time suddenly miraculously answered the words of the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, well, I am correcting this mistake now!" The vicious words accompany the direct movement, the other hand stretched over, tight I caught Wei's neck. Although the iron collar on the neck is still there, it is not a big obstacle in front of the power of this demon. The devil slowly uses force - so that this man can be a little bit more painful before he dies - the iron collar is huge here. Under the pressure, slowly bend, and the tighter the top of Wei's neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge silver cymbal sounded a cracking sound, a crack appeared, and in the rapid expansion, the dragon could be used without much time. Come out of this thing - but after Wei was strangled. The devil is increasing his strength. He does not want to let this human suffocate, but to pinch his neck directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a huge pressure on the neck. Wei took back one hand and wanted to open the claws of the cyan scales, but it was in vain. In the state of Berserker, Wei power has reached the limit that human body can support, but still won't win the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What to do!" Kim on the side is now anxious, and he has no choice. Here he lost contact with the gods, there is no way for magic. use. Moreover, this space is full of vindictiveness (this gold is still a bit skeptical), he simply can't get out of this defensive hood, it seems that the only one who can help Wei is the dragon elder, but he wants to get from that strange silver 茧It will take some time to come out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What should I do? The magician seems to be at a loss, and now he can't do anything, he can only stay in the shield that doesn't know how to get it out. correct! This shield! When the old Locke’s teachings suddenly appeared in his mind. "That power is what you call, it is sent through your body. Why can't you control it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician took a deep breath and started Try to control the power that doesn't know where to come from. Although it is very difficult, but he does not have much time, if you do not help, Wei will die in this respected person - no, this should be the hand of Wei Wang said eight eyes of the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It hurts! There was an indescribable pain in the shoulder blade on the right, and Wei knew that the injury caused by the hammer of the half-orc was not good, even with the help of the therapist. Wei knows that he has separated from the state of the Berserker. He is now trying to open a finger of the Devil with his right hand, so that his neck gets a little loose, but this is futile, and the power is getting stronger and stronger, and the neck is uploaded. The pressure is getting stronger and stronger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you want to die here? Really not reconciled! If the sword can be stabbed a little better, if it is not a stab in the shoulders...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Calm! The more angry you are, the more calm you will be!" Suddenly came the teacher's words, this is the teacher's teaching when he teaches swordsmanship! If he can keep calm, he will not rush directly to the devil, but will quietly wander around the devil, giving him a fatal blow when he is least paying attention. Maybe that would have won him in that way, but... Wei made a bitter smile in his heart. "Teacher, you don't know my mood. Although I have not forgotten your teaching, when I really face it, I have no way to keep it. Calm!!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 02<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eight-eyed demon looks at the human resistance in his hand slowly becoming weak. This person’s original strength is even a little surprised, but after all, A human being is better than him. He clearly looked at the human strength in his hand slowly becoming smaller, his eyes began to scatter, all of which are signs of death. He has seen countless times in similar scenes, but every time he looks like the first time, it is fresh and interesting. The feeling that the prey in his hand is slowly moving after struggling is really great. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn’t have to worry about someone having to disturb this fun. The dragon wants to come out in the shackles of his blood, and the magician is now a waste. Nothing can be done. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sudden blow rushed out of the mood of the demon from his mind, without any warning, a powerful force suddenly hit His arm fell very accurately to the side of the shoulder that was pierced by the demon sword. If it is normal, this force should be rebounded by his body, but the damn sword greatly weakened his body, plus he forced the use of this injured arm, this force cut into his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil uttered a painful cry, the arm could not support it, Wei’s feet fell to the ground, but the other paw was still tight Grabbed Wei's neck. This blow hit the most vulnerable part of the demon king. Under the action of the demon sword, the connection between his left hand and the rest of the body was now interrupted, and the left hand can now only uselessly hang down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil turned his body in anger, staring at his magical division with his eight eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an attempt that has never been done before. What kind of power does not have this attribute, neither fire nor wind, neither land nor water, learning in the past There is no way to control this power in any of the spells that have passed, and it is simply impossible to convert this power through the mantra. Old Locke taught him that he can control the magic with his will, but that is only the strength, weakness, and so on. After all, it is built on the basis of the magic spell. Now, he can only control it by the will. And transform this power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A difficult attempt, but he succeeded, it was a miraculous success, and after exhausting all his efforts to control, he converted that power Into a strong energy wave, launched from his hand, hit the devil's shoulder that was injured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The protective cover disappeared with the emission of energy waves. The huge pressure contained in the air rushed over to the magician. He would not be vindictive and could not offset this. Powerful to life, the current magician is like a person who can't swim. He is suddenly thrown into the deep water with a depth of 50 meters. The huge pressure rushes over him and squeezes his body. This force can neither resist nor resist. First, there is no way to breathe, then there are terrible pains from the five senses. Finally, there is... the anger of the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil throws Wei Meng, who has not moved, to the wall of the cave, and Wei’s left hand still grips the sword tightly, so this throw At the same time, the long sword that penetrated the body deeply was pulled out, and a blood flower was sprayed out. This new pain reinforces the hatred of this human magician, his right hand, a force immediately hit the magician's chest, a force enough to kill the magician 200 times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold’s body slowly slammed down, and as he squatted on the ground, his right hand finger showed a sound that no one noticed. A thing that was originally a ring turned into a broken piece on his finger. This gift fulfilled his last responsibility and finally collapsed after exhausting all the power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After disposing of the two humans, the huge cracking sound coming from behind made the Sayādaw turn around, and the elder dragon has tore the silver 茧Reappeared in front of him. The dragon's vitality is too strong, but in less than two minutes, the huge wound on the neck has stopped bleeding, and, obviously, some new meat has grown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation is wrong. In order to prevent the loss of wound vitality, it is necessary to concentrate on treating this wound that does not know whether it can be cured. In this case, even maintain There is no way to maintain the space protection between this cave and the outside. This damn dragon fills this space with its own powerful life energy, so that there is no way to display any skills. It’s not wise to confront the dragon under such conditions. The most terrible thing is that the sword is just here. If the dragon calls the huge reptiles and grandchildren, I am afraid I can’t go. . Once trapped by the dragons, the sword will become its own destination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it's wired! Lev touched the front with his hand. There was an invisible wall. Although the eyes could see it inside, there was no way for people to enter. Although I lied to the dragon group, I encountered an unexpected obstacle here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it’s better to lie to the Dragon! Or their vigilance is not strong enough, the other dragons are not paying attention, the red dragon's eyes are only staring at the front. I just bypassed a hillside, and when I turned a corner, I easily entered the cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a strange transparent wall that is both hard and flexible. It is very tough when stabbed with a knife. It is very hard when it is rubbed with a fist. I really don't know the dragon. The cave actually installed this super door, but since they can both enter, it proves that the door can be opened. Lev slowly explored all the way, but did not find any place that could be used as an entrance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oddly, this door suddenly disappeared, and Lev, who leaned forward, almost fell to a US president, but he still controlled his body. The thief vaguely felt that something must have happened in the depths of the cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Lev was preparing to step inside, a tall figure rushed over here at a speed that was indistinguishable to the naked eye, and suddenly there was a bad light. There is no way to see it clearly, but after this blue figure runs through his body, the thief clearly sees that this fast figure disappears into the air like dissolved, leaving nothing behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lev slammed his eyes, and he wondered if he had spent his eyes and saw hallucinations. No, this is not an illusion. There is indeed a person (maybe a person!) who just ran over here and then disappeared. A piece of black cloth on the ground proved the facts just now. An accident has occurred, something must happen unexpectedly, the thief ran into the depths of the cave, and his partner may need help! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing! Lev was relieved, although it seemed to be very serious, but there was not much actual harm. To be honest, when Wei Man was blood (dragon blood) and his armor was broken, he thought he had not saved it, but he accidentally had no fatal damage in his imagination. The ribs were broken and the others were only some. More serious bruises and sprains, there is only one place, a red huge round scar appears on the right shoulder, as if it was hit by a hammer, but this damage is normal as a wall The damage caused by a prominent part of the above did not cause any special attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician did not suffer any injuries, except for a huge hole in the magic robe, the body did not have any visible damage, in fact, he was only The strong pressure of life energy and coma in the past. After the demon escaped, the outer insulation disappeared and the elder dragon stopped releasing energy, so it did not cause much harm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei has already woken up, although his body is still unable to move now (the severely deformed iron collar has been taken down by Lev), but his The eyes are full of unwillingness. He can only loosen one left hand and hold it tightly, as if he wants to grab something but can't catch it. When thrown out by the demon king, even in the case of consciousness has been coma, his body still responded correctly, so that his generous shoulders and backs first contact the wall, and the back part of the body armor is still intact. , so this throw did not cause any harm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Lev looked at the injury and stood up, the others outside came in, along with the red dragon. When Lev took care of the two wounded, the elders of the dragon summoned the red dragon outside the cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night of the Dragon Island is really beautiful, there is no cloud, the sky The stars and the moon can be seen clearly. Listening to the sound of Haitao, sitting and watching the scenery in the sky is really a very enjoyable thing. However, the man sitting on the coastal slope now has no intention to see himself. I like the stars very much. Suddenly, the sound of the weeds in the cracks of the rock being heard by the human foot came from his ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it gold?" Wei asked in a low voice. He doesn't wear any armor now, only wearing two pieces of close-fitting clothes. The evening wind in the night brought coolness, but at the moment his mind was completely occupied by other things, and he did not feel the change of his body temperature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician stood by his companion, and under the treatment of Erna, the injuries of the two men were completely restored in the afternoon, but Elna To help the baby recover vitality (those dragons say so), it was dragged to the evening. Although the dragons can see things in the dark, they don't like to act at night, so the adventurers only have to spend the night in the island - fortunately their equipment is very complete. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe I really can't beat the Eight-Eyed Devil!" Wei looked up at his partner. Kim never thought of Wei’s expression of this expression. This frustrated expression would appear on Wei’s face. It seems that no matter how strong the person has the weak side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 03<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't say this! We will definitely have a chance!" This is to say, but if the words are not spoken, this self-deception will have no effect. Today's World War I let them know the difference between human beings and the Eight-Eyed Devil. Jin and Wei both vaguely felt that this Eight-Eyed Demon is not an ordinary demon. The difference in their strength is tantamount to the difference between ants and buffaloes. If there is no such thing as the dragon elders, the eight-eyed demon can kill both of them by ants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We looked down at the ground again. After witnessing the true strength of the devil, he realized how rugged his revenge is. In Wei's original mind, although the Eight-Eyed Devil is very powerful, he relies on his undead body and powerful magic. As long as you can find a way to kill him (this is the purpose of losing the mainland), use your own vindictiveness to resist the magic, you have a spell of money (although the chances of success are still small, but how much is possible). After the demon sword was obtained, this hope became true from nothingness, but what he saw today opened up a bottomless abyss between him and success, and isolated him forever on this shore of the abyss. If he does not feel desperate, it is simply a lie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can't win! I can't win at all! Nothing works! No matter what I do!" Wei suddenly used his fist to mammoth The ground, depressed, desperate mood vented out of the brain, ignoring the pain of his fists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop! Don't do this!" Gold desperately prevented this self-mutilation. If it is normal, Kim can't win this warrior either by physical strength or skill, but now Wei can't do any powerful struggle. He is easily pressed by the companion's strong body on the ground. Do not move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that Wei stopped the meaningless move, Kim slowly let go, today’s battle is very big for both of them, especially Wei Because gold does not have much direct hatred against the devil. And the magician is still immersed in the newly discovered joy, he can actually release the magic without using the mantra, this is a leap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am too useless! I am really useless! Teach me, teacher! What do I have to do!" Wei keeps face down The posture of kneeling on the ground did not move, and the magician heard the low sobbing of his companions. But Kim can't find any way to comfort Wei. The power of the devil is beyond the imagination of mankind. He can't beat him by the power of man! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wait a minute! Devil! Kim’s mind suddenly remembered the narrative poem that Old Locke told him that night, couldn’t it happen? Is there one left? In any case, since even the ultimate demon can be defeated, the demon (whether or not he is one of those three) is definitely not invincible! The high goblins can destroy the devil (always eliminated, even if one is missed), and humans have defeated the higher goblins, it is not impossible for humans to defeat the demons! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be like this! Wei! Listen to me, that Locke once told me one thing..." The magician lifted Wei from the ground and then put himself The story I heard from Old Locke was repeated to Wei. He was delighted to see that Wei’s eyes were full of glory. Although the specific battles of the brave people could not be verified, this at least proved that the devil could be defeated – the key is the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How can you overcome that power?" Wei asked urgently, but the answer to this question was not known to the magician. In fact, there is no People know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A huge body blocked the moonlight, cast huge black shadows on the two humans, Kim and Wei turned their heads, exactly in front of them The dragon elder. In the moonlight, this old dragon's scales are more full of mysterious transparency than the caves. The wound on his neck has completely healed, and even the scales have grown on it - of course, thinner and smaller than the scales of other parts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His power is very strange. From the situation of me and his contest, he is not an ordinary existence! We have been here for nearly 1,500 years. But I have never seen this race! But you seem to know that guy!" Long elders spoke up, and in an empty place, his voice still sounds so sweet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to do!" Kim stepped back and showed a warning attitude. This is normal. Anyone will be careful when a dragon suddenly appears in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't get me wrong!" Long elders bowed their heads, so they were closer to the two humans. "I am here to thank you! If not you both repelled The guy’s words, I’m afraid I will die under his hand! I shouldn’t treat you like this. Don’t say this, glimpse tells me, you have something to ask me, I think, as long as I know, I will try my best. Help!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a minute! What did you say? I will soon have a result with the Eight-Eyed Devil?" Wei stood up, very strange, he He could cry out in front of Kim, but in the face of the sudden appearance of the elder dragon, he quickly let his tears disappear, not to mention the fact that the elder Long had just said it was very strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you know, I am a different kind of my family!" Long elders looked up and looked at the stars in the sky, as if recalling the past, "My eyes can not only see what you see, but also the line of destiny that you can't grasp! I can see the future and see the development of the fate of others! Before the death of my original world I saw the upcoming ending of the world, so I can lead some of my followers to leave..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What did you see? Our future destiny is What!” Now it’s the turn of Kim’s urgent question. To be honest, anyone wants to know his future too much. Kim really wants to know if he can become a big magician like a teacher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am really sorry, but I can't explain it directly! Because this is against the laws of the world! However, I can give you some tips!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people are staring at the dragon elders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You two are different from other companions, your destiny is entangled! In a sense, you two are twins!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gemini? ? ! ! The two men glanced at each other. Whether it was height, appearance, or birthplace, the two people were too far apart, not to mention the difference in age between the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The connection of fate begins to flow after you are born, no matter how far apart, you are a destiny to meet! Although you can be born a long time apart, You are destined to die at the same time - let's call it death!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can...can't make it clear!" Both people have a vague I feel that I don’t lie to the elders when I say them, but it’s too difficult to understand them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can I kill the Eight-Eyed Devil!" Wei’s way of speaking is much more direct than Kim’s. He immediately asked the most concerned questions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't say! Although I was not born in this world, but since I am in this world, I am bound by the rules of this world! I I don’t want to say it, but there is no way to say it!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei doesn’t talk, he has a feeling of being fooled, but in my heart, there is a voice in the direction He said that the dragon did not lie to him. There is no way for human beings to understand the constraints that the elders of the dragon are now receiving. It is necessary to show the future to others and explain the color to the deaf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, I have a gift for you! As compensation for your loss!" Wei Wei eyes wide, looking at the front - just in There was a light ball between him and the elder dragon. With the gloom of the light, this thing began to show the true form. It was a pair of armor, a pair of full body armor that shines brightly, but the idiot can also see this. Not made of metal - at least not made of ordinary metal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is..." Kim also widened his eyes and looked at the armor suspended in the air. This thing reveals a kind of nothing, no The power of the method to grasp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't have the power to repair items, so I can only use this as a compensation! As your compensation for the destroyed armor!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You got this thing from there!" The armor fell in front of two people, and Kim Jong came down carefully to look at this miraculous thing. The style of this armor is very Different, just like the kind of aristocratic children made to order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 04<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A family that is hostile to the dragon family??!!" The magician looked at the armor while carefully pondering the dragon's words.There is no doubt that this thing is indeed a armor, and it is almost identical in structure to humans.Can it be said that there is also human life in the world where the dragons originally lived - if they can be called humans?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am really sorry, but I can't accept this gift!" Wei answeredHis words surprised the magician around him, but he immediately returned to God.Wei has his own personal experience. He knows the true value of this "unusable thing", just like his original armor (can't be found) and the mask.These things are no substitute for their owners.How can you forget your own hometown? This thing may already be the only thing that can be used to miss home.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon stared at Wei’s eyes with his eyes, as if reading Wei’s heart – maybe he’s really doing it – maybe thank you You! Young people, but I don't need this thing anymore. In order to match this weapon with you, I have already transformed him! This is the first trophy I have just grown up. In the fierce battle, I I was lucky enough to beat my opponent. I couldn’t win it, but with the eyes that can see through my fate, I still won.However, this has nothing to do with it. Now here is my home, where my family live."Long elders closed their eyes and opened again. "Don't refuse this compensation! For our dragons, rejecting gifts is a very rude behavior! Put on him, this weapon can give you a lot of help! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What else can you say? Wei Wei goes down, carefully caressing this armor - very smooth, as if it is soft and looks very hard, one I can't grasp the feeling, although it should look cold, but it doesn't feel ice at all. The temperature and body temperature of this armor are very close.In addition to the lack of helmets, the other parts are very complete.Wei put the armor on the body with the help of the magician.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the role of this armor?" The magician asked the warrior while asking the dragon elders.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not very clear, but as far as I know, this thing can gather strengthI think, you can slowly find out how to use him! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After completely putting on Wei's body, the brilliance of the original fluorescing on the armor suddenly disappeared, replaced by the texture of the metal, as if it were ordinary Made of steel<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's wrong?" But the surprise soon disappeared. This thing only changed color, and the other did not change at all.It’s really amazing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Young magician!" The dragon began to speak to Kim and interrupted the idea of ​​Kim. "You are brave enough to save your life." Your own companion! Really a great courage! Without your salvation, your companion is probably dead!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei surprised Looking at the magician in front of him, he did not know what happened at that time for the coma at the time.Kim’s face showed a confused expression, how did the dragon know (he was in that ) at the time), is it...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long elders gently I smiled a bit, as if I was wearing a gold heart, he patted the wings a little.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wonderful power flows into the body of Kim again. Yes, this is the power. When the Sage and the Dragon Elders fight, this power protects him. It is this power that saved Wei Yiming in the most critical time.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the case<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Lord Elder, actually we want to know some things about the Necromancer"The magician finally remembered their real purpose." My teacher told me that the dragons had fought with the necromancers and should know them better! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Necromancer? Those guys! "Long elders close their eyes, as if recalling something. "They are very strong guys, the operators of death power!" However, I don’t know a lot about them! I only know the general situation of them.However, after all, I went through that era and knew something that people didn't know! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long elders began to tell the story he knewIn the early years of the Holy Light Dynasty, the Necromancer was once considered a human being by a human being and was considered a branch of the magician.But later, with the passage of time, with the death of people of their peers, the necromancers began to be treated as aliens by other magicians, alienated by them.Later, some of them performed some magical experiments against morality in order to gain more power. When these things were revealed, people were even more hostile to the necromancer.The usual accumulation of hatred and fear finally broke out one day, and the rulers of the Holy Light Dynasty ordered the expulsion of the Necromancer, and the legislation prohibited the magical study of this faction.The Necromancer tried to resist, but it was impossible to fight against the magician who had an overwhelming advantage. After being killed most (or, to be destroyed), the Necromancers fled to a remote island.At that time, the magicians did not kill them, because they felt that the power of the Necromancer was no longer a threat (the Necromancer would not give birth and could not increase the same kind), so things dragged down until the Light of the Holy Light died.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As time went by, after experiencing numerous wars, large and small, the Leite Empire began to rise. In the red alliance (author's note: the history of the Red League is actually quite long. He was annexed by the Leite Empire, but reappeared after the Undead War. Although the political forms are similar, the former Red Alliance and the current The time difference has been more than three hundred years, so it can be considered that this is two countries with little relevance.) After that, the Leite Empire launched a war against the Karaf Empire, which is considered to be the orthodox heir of the Holy Light Dynasty. In the face of Kavra's powerful magic corps, the Reiter empire used almost all despicable means to buy, assassinate, divide, rumor, and finally disintegrated the fighting power of Kafra, which relied entirely on the Magic Corps. Before the capital was broken, I saw that the old Kafira monarch Alfonso had vowed to revenge. He and his most loyal subordinates used the sealed knowledge to transform themselves into necromancers, and then fled with the Pluto. Arrived at Undead Island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ruling body within the Necromancer is almost the same as the Holy Light Dynasty. A supreme ruler and a parliament composed of nobles (of course, zombie mages) exercise power together. Alfonso entered the parliament, and with the efforts of him and his several subordinates, coupled with the hatred of the former cruel expulsion, the necromancers finally decided to avenge humanity and launch the undead war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to know, what is the internal situation of the Necromancer?" After listening to the elders of the Dragon, Jin asked, although the elder Long said this is The story of the people, but what Kim really wants to know is still unknown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not very clear! But, as far as I know, they are very united inside. Just like our dragons! Living together for so much time, the companions around It’s a long-term thing that can’t be replaced. It’s very normal to care for each other! Although they are divided into three levels, there is no conflict between them!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What magic do they use?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In my memory, they have two magics that impressed me. One is swearing, dying The corpses become the cockroaches that they are manipulated. Without this magic, perhaps they have no way to pose a threat to humanity. The other is the death mantra, which produces a black mist that can destroy everything, and is caught in this fog. We have no way to survive the dragons! Also, "The elders' faces have a painful expression. "They will use the ultimate destruction magic, and they will be regarded as the curse of the curse in the curse. After the attack, he One of them used this magic, killing several of my compatriots and destroying himself! The necromancer sacrificed himself to stop our pursuit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The elder Long stopped talking and looked out. This past event evoked the pain in his heart. For the elders of the dragon, the death of every compatriot is an irreparable heartache. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How are they doing now?" Jin asked, asking this question is actually just because of the idea of ​​transferring the elders of the dragon, because it is obvious that the elders of the dragon do not know the necromancer. Current situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The failure of the Undead War did not change the attitude of the Necromancer. Because a large number of compatriots were destroyed, I believe their hatred towards human beings is deeper. Although I Not very clear, but they seem to be brewing new power, determined to revenge for their compatriots! If you are going to Undead Island, I advise you to dispel this thought, I am sure they will not let go of any human!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"New power?! Do you know the exact situation?" But the elder Long shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is all I know, if you" Dragon Elders especially increased the tone of the word "you", "Want to ask some other questions, Come to my cave!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a minute!" Long elders turned their heads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to know who invented the Undead Magic! Turn humans into necromancers!" The magician ran a few steps before asking "Light, Magic, The founder of the Holy Light Dynasty!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 05<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is it possible? Kim stopped, but the elder dragon should not lie to him because there is no reason to lie to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s the Holy Light that invented the Undead Magic, then, is the Holy Light himself...but, in the records of books that can be found now, the Light is ruled After twenty years of illness, after death, it will not become a necromancer. Is there a hidden secret hidden in history, or the necromancer can be reborn as a human being. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold slowly progressed deep into the cave, although he tried his best to lighten his footsteps, but in this silent silent cave, his footsteps were unique. The sound that can be heard, so it sounds particularly loud. Although he came here to be invited by the elders of the dragon, the magician did not know how to give birth to a feeling of being a thief. He wanted to let himself walk without making a sound, but obviously he did not have this talent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fear and excitement at the same time in the magician's heart, the excitement is because they are about to get the new knowledge they desire - the hints of the elders of the dragon are obvious enough, The fear is that the elders of the dragon are telling themselves something they don't want to know. Of course, there is also a concern that the guidance of the elder Long has no practical meaning for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a short but not a long distance. The elders are in the front, and he is lying on his treasure heap. It was a lot shorter during the day, but he obviously didn't sleep, but he was waiting for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are here!" Long elders spoke up, "I know you will come!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "How do you know that I will come!" But the question in my heart has not yet said that the elders of the dragon will answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the past, there were a lot of humans who came to see me, and there are things in them that are like them! So, I know you will come to me!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Many Humans?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, are the same magic as you." Teacher! Like you, they come to pursue knowledge and want to learn from me the valuable knowledge lost in the era of the Holy Light."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then they Later..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Besides a small part, everything else succeeded! After all, this is the knowledge created by mankind, and I have no reason not to teach these things. To humans! However, unfortunately, the books I saved have been taken away by your first movers, so I can't give you some books you want! Moreover, our dragons themselves have no habit of using words! I didn't have a copybook to stay!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Nothing on the gold surface But in fact "disappointed" the word has clearly written on his face, and if there is no long-term studies for books, then, a number of achievements at night can do? Magic is the same as many other techniques. The solution to a problem is often accompanied by an even more difficult problem! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long elders smiled softly. In fact, Kim understands this expression as a laugh. For different races, the difference in expression is very large, especially the dragon and the human race, which have huge differences in appearance. Most of the people and the dragon rely on their eyes to determine each other's expressions - since the elders' eyes are smiling, the fangs should be laughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to ask..." But the elder Long interrupted him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I agree to guide you, young people!! However, you know, we don't have much time, we can't learn like ordinary human teaching!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know? Our dragons have a special ability. It is because of this ability that we have almost no real conflict with each other! We can think Communicate with each other, once there is any contradiction, let each other know their own thoughts at the moment, the contradiction will often be solved. Although the dragon and the human being are different, and I have not tried it, but I think, maybe we can try "!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ideological exchange!" Kim’s mind immediately remembered the red dragon and blue dragon that he saw in the square during the day, and they were almost two They have reached the point where they are in danger of each other, but they suddenly appear to be in a position to look at each other. Is that the exchange of ideas! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the exchange of ideas, you can know everything I know, I can also know everything in your mind, but I have a request, that is Don't forcefully peek at what I don't want others to know. Do you agree?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I agree, but..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's it, I always believe in the commitment of the brave! Let's get started!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a person breaks in at this time, he can just see a strange scene: a dragon and a person face to face, big eyes and small eyes, both sides are motionless, eyes are sluggish, as if the soul was deprived of something. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold looks at his feet, or that he thinks he is looking at his feet, below and above, as if in a hollow, nothing There is no way to confirm even your own existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Begin, first, the composition of the world!" A voice passed directly into the brain of the magician. "To control the power, you must first know all things." The roots!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Below, no, it’s the whole world, and the scene begins to appear. Although Kim has never seen this scene, he knows these strangely. What is it in the end - the scene that appears in front of the scene is the scene of the formation of this world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a mess and disorder, and countless energies collide, collide, produce and die in each other. In this piece of chaos, one is the most powerful. The energy was born. Trapped by this powerful energy, all the energy begins to flow in a fixed direction, and the whole world begins to become orderly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is..." Kim looked at his feet (because he emphasized the existence of the self, so his body appeared in the world of thought)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This flow is time!" Without any error, the voice answered when he had this problem in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although all the energy is following the same flow, the forces are still in conflict and fusion. The original traction energy also began to collapse, dispersing into some smaller energy. As this flows, some of the energy begins to form a fixed posture that is no longer affected by other forces. Kim looked at this scene and he knew that these forces were the foundation of the world. The four most powerful, earth, wind, water, fire, and four basic forces are mixed with each other, and in the local they begin to fuse, and matter begins to appear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, the scene suddenly changes rapidly. Before the magician has not had time to react, the surrounding world is already in the world, a bird of flowers, various creatures in this Living in the world, everything is so beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the world is composed of energy, what is God?" Just as before, the answer horse was uploaded into the head of the magician. "The gods of this world are representatives of the will of all kinds of energy that make up the world! They are born from the energy that creates oneself, but they dominate the energy. The purpose of their existence is to expand themselves, that is, the power to which they belong!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician no longer asks, he seems to know, but there is no way to capture these things! This should be because the elders of the dragon themselves are not very clear about these things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A feeling came in. In this virtual world, Kim’s senses suddenly became sharp, and he could feel the existence of various forces that make up the world. Those forces exist on their own side, in non-stop activities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These tiny power individuals are called elves! It is the smallest incarnation of energy, they are omnipresent, and the source of all magical power! Humans dominate the elves by God's commands Use power to create human-specific magic. High-level goblins communicate directly with the elves, using so-called elf magic, and our dragons use their own life energy to drive the elves to use magic, causing what you humans call 'dragon magic. '! Although the way is different, no matter what magic must be achieved through the wizard! In fact, the essence of all magic is the same!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new question mark again I got out. "What about the magic array?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The magic array is a combination of symbolic symbols accepted by the gods, which can summon the elves and the combined power according to a fixed pattern!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now come to my memory, do whatever you can to find the magic you want to know! But remember your commitment to me, don't Go and inquire about the part of my confinement!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scenes of the virtual world have all disappeared, what the eyes can see - or this is only what the eyes see - - It's just a piece of darkness, but in the darkness, there is a light. The light quickly came to the front, and when the magician had not returned to God, he and the light were combined. Huge knowledge and memory flowed into the minds of the magician. Some of these things were left after a contact had not been made. Although Kim could capture them, at the moment he had no extra leisure because more things were Into the mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
