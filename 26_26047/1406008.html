This is not a human being, but a necromancer, and the most powerful zombie. Master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You, sorry, let everyone meet such unpleasant things. I am the lord of the Holy Light Dynasty, the king of the Uncle Island (the old name of the Undead Island), the second manager of the temple, The wearer of the royal robes, the life-famous mentor of the Dynasty Magic Academy, and the illusionist Nobis, welcome you to my place!" The sorcerer of the purple robes skillfully presented a series of proofs to humans. The title, perhaps this is the habit of years of development, but in fact these titles (including the source of the title) have long since become history - of course, the adventurer will not (and may not) point out to him This is true. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"End?" Five people stood on the coast, stunned Looking at the solid land under the feet and the endless blue waves behind me, it is impossible to judge from this point whether they are on the mainland or on the island of the undead, but the red sun that has just risen from the end of the sea. The distant houses revealed by the first ray of light can prove that they have come to the place where humans live. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What a strange thing?" Lev jumped, and the solid touch from his feet was not an illusion. They have indeed returned to the mainland, and It is not far from a certain village. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of momentary moving magic is the first time for them, so the impression that the surrounding scene changes completely in an instant is particularly strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are back? There is no real feeling! But if gold will use such a convenient magic, we will be relaxed! All the journeys can be omitted!" Han sent a feeling, but in fact he also knows that this level of magic must be difficult, the magician may not - after all, he is just a trainee magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go back to my store first!" Red nose boss first started to act. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others are behind the Czechoslovakia, who have lived here for many years, and soon judged where they are - they are not from the city now. Far, in fact, it takes only one hour to reach the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In any case, I am finally alive!" Lev walked and spoke with a voice that he only heard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After midnight, after a failed night attack by a necromancer, a zombie mage suddenly appeared, first to get rid of those raid wizards, and then Take them to their place of residence - a house that is a bit large. However, he did not come up with a good wine and good dish to entertain them like the previous Wolf, but directly told them what he meant - the magician left and the others went back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is someone asking me to give you some magical guidance!" The zombie mage said so simple, then used the magic of moving the moment Everyone except gold was sent back to the mainland. And the fool magician used this to say goodbye to them. "Do not worry, I will meet you in the city of Delante!" Make it clear that you are with the necromancer, without other human help ( Although the help may be limited), what should be done by those undead wizards who become their kind? But when the magician heard that he could learn ancient magic, he was so excited that he couldn’t even distinguish between the southeast and the northwest. Where can you understand the sinister traps! Forget it, as the adventurer often said, "I believe in my companions!" Kim should be able to do it, there will be no problems, or he will be obedient. Although Lev thinks this magician is a bit silly (in some respects), he should also know that these necromancers cannot be fully believed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is already spring, the sunlight projected from the sky will not cause any rejection. It is very comfortable to wear on the body. In the sun that was a little drowsy, several soldiers stood in the doorway of the city with a lazy gesture against their spears. Although their duty is to guard, they do not block or check the crowds coming in and out of the city gates - they just stand here and look like they are. Although Medellin is an anarchic city, the Chirila Kingdom has at least announced the sovereignty of the city. Therefore, there is a short one and a half months between spring and summer each year - that is, the necromancers have completed their After the hunt - a Chirila army (at least nominally) will be stationed here. Like all wise men, the commander of this army understands that all they need is a name, so the existence of this army has no effect on the order of the city - they have not fulfilled (also Inability to perform) their original duties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it him?" A soldier licked his companion with his elbow. Although this sentence asked no words, his companions understood what it meant - they went to "fish and wine" to drink alcohol instead of two. After that, I can't be familiar with the familiar face with red nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There should be no mistake! The nose has never seen a second person! But..." The soldier shook his spear, and the Czech boss was dead. It has long been one of the hunters of the Necromancer - in fact, if the person who did not see it after that day is basically the result - even his pub is already someone else's. But the eyes are obviously the red nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the eyes of the soldiers, the group walked into the gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s him, not dead, it seems that he hid somewhere to escape this robbery!" After watching the figure disappear into the city gate, the soldier We made this conclusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The guy who took up his store to change to a warehouse is unlucky!" said the leader. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is going on here?" The red nose boss grabbed the one. The person who moved the cabinet inside the store, although it was not long after leaving it, but the store has completely changed, the door has changed, the wall has been changed, and the tables and chairs inside have disappeared. In fact, almost It has changed completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah!" When the young man saw who the person around him was, the whole body jumped back half a step, but he immediately returned to God. Come, there is a living person, not a dead body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not dead?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Nonsense, I am living well, this is What happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, no, nothing!" The young man said that he was back, and then suddenly turned and ran away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened, did the extra cabinet move out of the warehouse?" With this voice, a person came out from inside, and then he I saw a group of people outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hanke in the grocery store?!!What are you doing in my store?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Jie... Czech... Czech, you are still alive? You are not a necromancer..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turns out that you thought I was dead So you took up my store and ruined everything in the store..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I...I don't, I just help you I changed a door and helped you paint the wall. The furniture was taken away by others. It has nothing to do with me... I said that I still lost a lot of money... forget it, I will not want you to ..." Hank threw a key toward the hand of the red nose, and then turned away with a chic! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah..." Czecho look at the empty shop and look at the faces of other people. The face of this red nose boss at the moment is really indescribable. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orc rushed over, the big knife waving in his hand, the momentum was very Scary, but the magician calmly finished the magic of the flame, and then reached out, the hot energy will flow out of his hand, engulf the half-orc. But when the magician's hand was aimed at the target, a cobra with a bloody red letter appeared on the magician's wrist. Its head was swollen with anger, and the mouth was wide, and the slender fangs could be seen. The sultry cold light. The wrist is uploaded with the kind of icy wetness that is unique to the body of the reptile. The eyes see the tiny poisonous droplets that are oozing out of the deadly fangs of the flesh. The instinct of human beings defeats everything. Hands-on, I want to get this dangerous animal out of my hand. But before the reptiles were thrown away, the fangs were buried in the wrist of the magician's unobstructed wrist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the magician has no way to take care of the venom that has entered the blood, because another, more deadly, has come, and the Orc has waved a big knife and cut it at him. The magician couldn't escape. It should have been a cold blade. At this time, it felt extremely hot, and it was the burning of blood and flesh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The burning pain disappeared immediately, and the surrounding scenery completely changed. The cold voice of the Necromancer came from the ear. "You have failed!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The magician touched his forehead with his hand. It was all cold sweat. Although it was obvious that everything was caused by illusion, but the feeling of the battle was so real, Kim couldn’t help but see if his waist was There is a big knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have died twice, plus the previous one, you have already died 50 times in three hours, this is a remarkable achievement, no A little bit of skill can't really be done!" The sneer of the Necromancer is still going on. It has probably not been taught for a long time. He made a big review of the teacher's speech against the students to make up for the strangeness of so many years. "You really disappoint me. I really can't imagine someone recommending you to me like this fool! Ten thousand enemies can't beat, one thousand enemies can't beat, one hundred enemies can't beat, now even two enemies You can't beat it! And it's just an ordinary half-orc plus a snake! You only need to use one of the simplest magic spells to solve the enemy you can't beat! Are you a magician? No wonder you are still a trainee magic now. Teacher, I see that you have no hope of upgrading in this life!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can a snake suddenly appear on my wrist? This kind of thing is not What may happen!"< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop! Don't look for external reasons for your failure, find reasons to find on yourself! Anything in this world can happen Otherwise, why should the three chaos gods exist? Your failure can only be attributed to your own tempering! Take a break and continue after fifteen minutes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The magician stepped out of the magic array, and then looked at the thing that had never been seen before, using the magic crystal. If he had quite looked down on the magic of the spiritual system before, now this view has completely changed. I didn’t think that there is such a real and terrible illusion in the world. If this power can be used in actual combat, I am afraid there is nothing. Things can be confronted with this real illusion. This illusion has moved away from the boundaries of vision and can affect all senses. But Nubis also said that illusion is almost the highest in the spirit of magic, beyond the current ability of the magician! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the body does not actually have this feeling, but Kim’s brain still remembers the feeling of a fatal blow just now, actually, just this morning, Kim I have enjoyed 50 experiences that I can only enjoy once in my life. It is really appropriate to use this illusion for practical training. Unfortunately, as Nubis said, this method is very useful, but it is also very dangerous. If he is not a sorcerer who does not know fatigue, he will never be alone. Use this training method. If the magic is not terminated in time, the trainee is prone to life-threatening, as the necromancer said, “If you think you are dead, then you are really dead!” In this magic that affects all senses at the same time, the fake sum Really the same danger! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician sat down on a chair, his body clearly did not experience any exercise, but now the gold is very tired - just and true Playing the same battle in fifty battles! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ass is still not hot, the zombie mage has come over again, and he can't help but push the gold into the magic circle and start a new round of training. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s surrounded by a white mist, white, and no one. But the magician is still very nervous, he looks around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although I shouldn’t have done this, it seems that without my help, you will not make any progress! We don’t have much time, but now I have no other way to meet such an idiot student. I have to start from the most basic!" A voice rang from the mind of Kim, and Nobis was talking. "Now you have to face an enemy, only one. Don't let me down again!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fog, a figure appears, a figure with a sword. The magician immediately started the magic, using a blasting bullet, this time should not lose. The fog faded, revealing the wilderness at the foot, and also showing the true face of the opponent to the magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wei!" The blonde screamed, "How are you here?" When you say that you know your stupidity, you are now in illusion. It’s not a strange thing for a companion to be an opponent – ​​something more strange than this has happened, even if a cobra suddenly pops out on the wrist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jian Shengfei fluttered, the sword was in his hand, and the vindictiveness suddenly spurred, and the magician subconsciously driven the smashing bullets to advance, but in the face of vindictiveness all made nothing. Wei's speed is fast, there is no time to leave a second spell on the gold, the magician rushes back, but the sword has reached his nose, all efforts are futile, he has not escaped the sword. Just when the magician intended to close his eyes and wait for death, the body of the warrior suddenly disappeared and the bubble disappeared. The roar of the necromancer was heard in his mind. "Stupid, one can't deal with it, it's really useless!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How does Juggernaut pull? Magic is hard to fight, but who told you to fight with him? With a little brain, it's really mad at you! Forget it, give you another chance, come again!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hard fight? But what if you don’t fight hard? Defensive magic will still break the vindictiveness... Right!” Kim suddenly remembered when he was at the Delante City Competition. The thing, "Use flying magic, right, use flying magic to consume his vindictiveness and have a chance to win!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of the warrior appears again from a distance, I rushed over to Kim again, but the magician ignored him and prepared his own flying magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, fly to the sky, now only my offense, the magician is thinking about it, while planning to attack with the simplest fireball, but Suddenly, he found that the target under his feet had disappeared. The magician looked around and found nothing, but nothing was found. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A shadow obscures the sun - this illusion is no different from reality - the magician looks up and looks desperately behind the warrior in front of him A pair of huge wings...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surrounding scene is restored, Kim sits in the middle of the magical array, gasping for a big mouth, Nubis is watching He, then slowly said: "You have died a total of sixty times now! If you really participate in the battle, it is no good to give you a few therapists!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"But how can people grow their wings? This is impossible! Unless a miracle happens!" Kim tried to argue that after Wei had his wings, he could not fight against it. In the battle of fantasy The sword in Wei’s hand did not know how many times he entered and exited his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I said that there is nothing in this world that is impossible!" Surprisingly, the Necromancer is now not angry - probably really no strength Angry - "The world is divided into two kinds of forces, order and chaos. The chaotic three gods represent the power of chaos, and the other gods represent the power of order. The power of chaos is to add unpredictable factors to the world, and the order Power rationalizes these unstable factors. If your companion grows wings, it is really strange, but if he is a winged person, everything is reasonable. It is because of the 'impossible' of everything you have seen in the past. Everything has been rationalized, so you don't know the truth that 'nothing in the world is impossible'. If a person said to you a year ago, 'you will get the guidance of a necromancer', don't you? Will you answer 'this is impossible'? There is a miracle in this world. You didn't realize that just because the miracle was born, the miracle itself has been rationalized, no longer strange. ! A "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; magician was silent, Necromancer, then he can not refute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Forget it, take a break today, look at your current state, and then train it will hurt, go eat something first, don't do it in the afternoon. Practical training, let me see how many magic spells you have learned!” The Necromancer sighed and turned and walked outside the room. As the saying goes, disappointment will be as high as hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately this is the illusion caused by illusion, otherwise it will be terrible!" The magician smiled, but the necromancer who heard what he said turned around. Come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you think that all the illusions are just now?" The face of the Necromancer seems to have a mocking smile. "There is no such thing as a fantasy in this world, as long as you All senses are recognized, that's true! This is the real reason why illusion can be used to kill people!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ceremony is still going on. Although it has gathered a lot of power, it is not enough. The magic symbols of the whole room are all working hard, but the power needed to implement this ceremony is always In terms of volume, the speed is still very slow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wolf stood still in the room, waiting for the moment of the decision. This ceremony has never been held by anyone, and probably will not be there in the future. However, if the world can exist forever, this kind of thing will happen one day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What will Babe be like at the end of the ceremony? Wolf doesn’t know what it will be like after the ceremony, Wolf is not very clear – although there are A little bit of it. But this ritual is indispensable, and Wolf himself exists for this matter - it is not accidental that he becomes a necromancer, but for the needs of this matter, when he becomes a zombie mage, Pluto tells He is. Babe is born with a specific fate, even if it is not the damn terminal illness, even if it is not accidental encounter with the sage, even if his wife is still alive, Wolf has long been destined to become a necromancer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How much do we have in total?" Behan pulled Lev aside and asked. Because half of the reasons why the pub has become the present is their responsibility (although strictly speaking, this problem is not their fault), so everyone decided to help the red-nosed boss, but some things can’t be done by responsibility alone. Support on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are some!" Lev used a reluctant look to calculate the total amount of wealth, although they just counted when they first set off. Rich in oil," but after so long trips and accidents, there is not much money left now - but it is more than enough to travel. It takes a lot of money to restore the pub to its former appearance. Tables and chairs, dishes, cabinets (only one left), wine barrels (and wine), all kinds of groceries, rough and rough, need a big one. Spend money! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Enough?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Absolutely enough, if we can get a dragon for free Take back to the city of Delante!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not enough? How many?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you deduct travel expenses, you can probably buy him four chairs!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only this is the point? Right, Lev! I remember you have something. , I mean, some little things that are of little use, but worth a lot, I happened to see it last time..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why don't you hit you?" The idea of ​​the magic sword? That thing can be very valuable, it is enough to open three stores!" Although he thought so, Lev did not say it, because a woman’s eyes looked over, no matter how unwilling, The husband still took out a bag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adding these should be enough!" Leif himself felt a bit strange, how could such a generous spit out from his mouth? These things are very commemorative. This is the trophy that the magician got the first time to complete the mission. The thing he got from the Wyvern is a souvenir to commemorate the days with the magician...< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leif opened the bag, and the contents of it were scattered on the counter, and the eyes of the pawn shop owner smashed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I see... this ring is very delicate, four gemstones!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" What, this thing is only four gems? See clearly, this carving, this ancient method of work, a diamond coin is worth!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This earring ...a little broken, and not a pair, a gem coin... If you are not satisfied with my price, go to another house, if you can find someone else!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Strong dragons are difficult to fight, the thieves can only bear this breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pawnshop’s eyes are aiming at this pile of things, probably estimating how much they can earn from this sale, but his eyes are fixed On one thing, one of the most inconspicuous things, a black shiny stone, looks like a black crystal, this is not something in the bag, it is brought out together when taking out a small bag from the arms. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this embarrassing businessman miscalculated his opponent. The guest in front of him is young, but he is an equally awkward and experienced guy, Lev Every look of the pawn shop owner was clear. He reached out and grabbed the black crystal and made it look like he was going back to his pocket. Sure enough, the boss reached out and wanted to stop the action, although his The hand just shook back as it stretched out, but it didn't escape Lev's eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This does not sell!" Lev put the crystal in his hand, although it seems to be put back in the pocket, but did not put it in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait a minute, can young people take the piece of magic crystals and let me see?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the magic crystal?" Lev remembered where this thing came from, did not think that the necromancer was extravagant to use the magic crystal to do the door, really hate not to dig a few pieces at the time! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, this thing, you know, such valuable and practical things, generally not sold! You know, after all, this thing is very rare ..." Although I just knew what it was, Lev’s calm look made his opponent unable to see this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything is solved! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, Kim!" Lev trots with a smile Ignore the gesture of the magician's alert and force his shoulders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look clearly, see what this person wants to do! You must learn to distinguish between friends and enemies, no matter how powerful the magician can't resist the one stabbed by him. If you can't master this skill, no matter how much power is meaningless to you! After all, as long as it is still a human being, you can't keep a defensive magic forever!" The voice of the Necromancer sounded from his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My teacher once gave me a ring, a ring with protective magic, which saved me many times..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician did not pay attention to the phantom around him. He used a calm tone to refute the training that the necromancer gave him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know what you are going to say, I know the magic items. But do you know how these things guard you? You really think they have their own Thoughts and senses, can you judge whether you are in danger? No! These things are only activated when you realize the danger yourself! But if you realize the danger, the sword front is often already seen from your chest. Come out! Don't talk nonsense, come on, carefully judge the true intention of the man around you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold looks at this lev, even though he knows he is A phantom is part of this illusion, but he can't tell the difference between him and his real companions. Illusion doesn't impose any feelings on you, but extracts feelings from people's memories, so if you don't know them, no one can tell the difference between illusion and reality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician looked at the phantom and wanted to find out from him what was different from the real one, but this effort failed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can't see it, I can't see anything! He is no different from that Lev!" After listening to the words of the Necromancer, it is natural. I feel a dangerous feeling from this phantom, but the magician knows that this is an illusion, not a truth. This phantom does not see any point from any angle - even a little bit - the expression of hostility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look at his eyes, the eyes will not deceive the soul! This is the real illusion, and there is no difference, this is the real battle! Look at his eyes See if he is a monster to become your companion to deceive you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician turned to the phantom face, but the eyes were not only laughing Nothing can be seen, this is Lev! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Attention, see clearly, every subtle change, every thought hidden in the eyes! No matter which kind of intelligent creature, in his mind Everything that is thought will be reflected in his eyes, even if it is the deepest thought hidden! Even if you can't read every thought of him in detail, the most obvious and strongest ones can be seen, that is overwhelming existence. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart of Kim suddenly moved, he thought of a way, but the voice of the Necromancer immediately remembered again. It seems that when using illusion, the operator and the subject are connected at a certain level of consciousness, otherwise how can Nubis know the idea of ​​Kim now! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't use mind reading! You can't use magic to detect people around you under any conditions! Even a powerful magician, there are things You can't do it with magic! Use your own feelings and try to expand your senses!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can't see, can't see anything! The magician closed his eyes a little frustrated, but when he opened again, he felt a cold flow in the side ribs, and then turned into a hot, this feeling is no longer familiar, I felt dozens of times this morning, That is the feeling of steel piercing the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician turned his head and just met the phantom face. At this moment, he felt the smile, the look, the hostility and cruelty hidden under the expression. This is not Lev, absolutely not, the thief who loves to be greedy and cheap is not exposed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician suddenly felt a blackened consciousness, and then he didn’t know anything! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nubis looked up, as if talking to himself, "It has been so long since it became a necromancer, forgetting that the human body is very easy to reach the limit! I thought that after the afternoon spell test you have recovered! Hahaha..." The laughter suddenly stopped, and the tone of the Necromancer suddenly became lonely and sad. "Although it is, but I still miss a human being, even if I never regret it becomes a necromancer!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After, two, continuous attacks can not hurt the intruder's hair For this intruder, the dwarf warrior’s voice is more threatening than his axe, but this threat is greatly reduced by the existence of the great memorial. With the killing along the way, you can hear the sound. There are not many ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two more soldiers came out, this should be the same team as this soldier, now there are only three, in fact, even if there are thirty, it does not matter. . The long sword suddenly attacked from the crevice of the Tomahawk attack like a viper, piercing the body from the gap of the armor. The dwarf looked at the Jianfeng who entered through the unbelief. He wanted to swing the axe again, but with With the long sword pulled out, the power was quickly lost from his body, his feet were soft and involuntarily, and then the whole body fell to the ground, and the new blood sprinkled again on the old blood, stained with the iron of the intruder. Boots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other two soldiers rushed over, but the long sword that is eager for blood is ready to accept the new sacrifice...<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last body fell down, a body with a robes, there is no inconvenience here, the intruder walked into the room that was most closely guarded, in the middle of the room, in On the unusually beautiful pedestal of the engraving, a gem that exudes the inexhaustible brilliance of the language is standing there quietly. This is the artifact of the legendary dwarf family. The god Ip (casting, honest, polite god, the guardian of the craftsman) worshipped by the dwarf is a dreamlike sacred object given to his people. It is said that the dwarf is infinitely creative. The heart of inspiration, the jewel of Loding, also known as the temptation of gems. In ancient myths and legends, the power of this gem is to seduce everyone who sees him trying to own it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brilliance of the jewel illuminates the room, the fascinating, indescribable brilliance, but the intruder is not confused by the brilliance of this being He strode forward, picked up the jewel from the pedestal, then turned and left...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, found, only one, only he is still alive With the words, the five dwarves carried a body to the dwarf king who was violently thundering. "What happened, who took the sacred thing?" The dwarf wearing a golden crown was swooping in front of the soldier, and he swayed the dying body. The dwarf king's red beard had a tendency to tilt upwards, but now it is almost above the eyes. This may be a miracle. The body that has been gradually extinguished by the fire of life is stimulated by this shaking, and the last spark is once again bloomed. The soldier opened his eyes. "Swear by my axe, as evidenced by my own eyes, it is... humans have taken away our artifacts..." The soldier used his last strength to say his last sentence as clearly as possible, and then he fell. Into the arms of Pluto, but he has done his last duty as a guard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s another day of training, it’s been ten days in a row, these days Kim spends every night in a nightmare. It is not that the meat on the grill is the delicious food in the hands of the giant beast. The nightmare of the day is also continued in the night. All the battles of these days ended with his own unfortunate death. The magician felt that the so-called hell was the most, but he persisted. One of the most obvious improvements is that he has learned to stop the magic for the sudden change. But he still can't be called by Nebis as the "most basic" ability to distinguish between the enemy and the enemy from the eyes of others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the last time! The last time of today!" With the sound, the magician was re-invested in the illusion, in fact, this time the gold has Very tired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The illusion entered the magician’s senses, and he found himself in a grassland that had never been seen before. In front of him was a back to him. Men, Jin is very familiar, but what appears in this test is all familiar to the magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are..." The magician is also proficient. The opponents who appear in this exam are not the ones who started from the beginning. They are all set first. It was almost a while, then I started from behind. The task of the magician is to see if they are hostile – although it has not been successful so far, only when steel enters the body, Kim can see something different from the real person from the other’s eyes. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good friend, but the whirlpool of memories is immediately engulfed by reality. The magician remembers that this thing is just to test his own "real" phantom. When the phantom comes over, the magician can't help but feel nervous. After all, it is stabbed. The feeling of a knife is not pleasant, even in illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can't see it, I can't see anything!" Kim screamed in the heart of the wizard who controlled this illusion, this childhood friend walked with no expression Come over, the magician stared at his eyes, but his heart was only stunned. Maybe it’s fear (strictly speaking, it’s annoying) the feeling of being stabbed into the body by steel. This phantom takes a step back every step of the gold. He wants to find out what is in the eyes of this phantom, but find out what he is. Did not find it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remove distracting thoughts! There are too many things in your heart! Eliminate distracting thoughts that are not helpful now, everything is in front of your eyes, as long as you can open your eyes !"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A spell swayed in the mind of the magician, but Nubis stopped the move in time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not act rashly. If you are a real person in front of you, will you do it? Now is not a test of your combat ability. Do not do it before you determine his hostility. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Close your eyes, take a deep breath, don't be nervous, the more you are nervous, the more you can't know! With the calmest heart, eliminate all distractions! I know You are young, impulsive, and adventurous! But the magician doesn't need this. A really good magician needs absolute, can correctly read the calmness of the spell under any conditions, and have the judgment to make the right choice. And the absolute control of the magic that you call out. Keep calm, eliminate distracting thoughts, and all hidden things will be displayed in front of you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician wants to follow The wizard of the Necromancer did, but he couldn't do it. He wanted to see his heart through the eyes of the phantom, but there was a barrier that he couldn't break through. There was a barrier in his own heart that prevented the magician's gaze. This is the same as most of the learning, the teacher is easy to say, but the learner is always difficult to do! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The phantom is approaching step by step, and Kim has begun to have a feeling of self-destruction. Anyway, it will not be really killed. It’s no big deal. - I have already smashed so many knives before! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sorcerer who controlled the illusion sighed in disappointment - this is a habit, not a need - he has some connection with Kim's thoughts, the magician's He can feel some in his mood. It seems that this time it failed again. Only after waiting for tomorrow, Kim can't learn anything about this state. The Necromancer is ready to end this spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gold! You listen, there is an accident! This illusion... He is no longer under my control! I can't terminate... no way ...... There is a powerful force in the interference... Impossible... Listen, now everything depends on yourself. You must be convinced that all this is false. Even if you have a little shake, you will die. The power of interference is getting bigger and bigger... It’s difficult to keep the connection! I am not sure what will happen... Remember! Be sure that everything is fake...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words of the Necromancer screamed in the heart of Kim, intermittently, and the wizard initially thought it was a deliberately arranged trap—how ​​could there be magic in the world that could interfere with a zombie mage? What about the power? But then he ruled out this possibility. The words of the Necromancer are not as simple as he took the initiative to stop, but are getting weaker and weaker, and finally interrupted if the words are not finished! After all, in the illusion, there is a connection between Kim and Nobis. At this time, Kim also clearly felt that this connection was interrupted by external forces. In other words, the current gold is lost by a person in a place where anything can happen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The phantom in front of him still hasn’t changed. He is still slowly moving forward step by step, but at the moment the magician’s heart feels a panic, he has no confidence. There is no such difference between resisting this and reality. Although it is obvious that this is an illusion, but this scorns the breeze of the skin, the solid earth under this foot, the white clouds in the sky, the Ken in front, everything is such true, if When the sword penetrates into the body, I can believe it all, can convince myself of the clear pain, is the feeling of blood flowing out is fake? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use magic to solve this phantom first, but the magician’s prayer melts into nothingness when it is read, and loses the support of Nubis, the illusion There is no god in the world that can respond to his prayers, even if his real body is full of magical energy and has no effect on the body of the illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
