			<div id="content">The Ghost Master floated out, and the zombie mage in the black robe gathered the pieces of the crystal ball that had been collected and then threw it away from the open window. Now it is clear that the light coming in from the outside of the window is actually from the outside wall. It was sent out - the building itself was included in a larger building. The black robe turned and passed the crystal from the window and the crisp sound of the bone collision, but he ignored it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wolf is now having a problem to solve: how he will deal with these humans who come to the island. At first he planned to drive these people out of the island, let them know that the road was nowhere and then retreat, but for some reason, the seals in the woods suddenly lost their function, and the adventurers came out of them. It was definitely a place that could never be found. Wolff began to wonder if the power of the magician in the adventurer's team was beyond his expectations, but from the crystal ball it was just a trainee magician, and there should be no power to defeat the seal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the case of the fragmentation of the crystal ball, Wolf can roughly speculate on how the treasure was destroyed. The Brett must have used magic to directly attack those humans through the crystal ball. As a result, in the human counterattack, the crystal ball cannot be destroyed by the change of space power. Brette is really stupid. This crystal ball is only suitable for triggering magic traps. If it can support the load generated by magical battles, then the Necromancer does not need to arrange magic traps. It is not finished to kill the invaders through the crystal ball. ? I really didn't think that the people sent by the Sayādaw were so stupid! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is still something to be happy about. Wolf walked into the inner room of his room. The furnishings were as simple as the outside. The most conspicuous was a table placed against the wall. There was a portrait in the middle of the table, and the flowers on both sides and the front were full of flowers. . This is a portrait of a woman, a beautiful woman who is in the golden age of life is showing the most touching smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wolf took a little bit of the withered flower and gently stroked the mo with the other hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Qila, your education is excellent! Even after leaving me so much time, without my care, Beibei is still so healthy and lively. If you You can see how good it is! Hey, you are a good mother, and I am an unqualified father. I don’t even know if my daughter is lost!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold opens his map and passes the position of magic, he has roughly determined his location. They are now in the middle of Undead Island, about a day away from the Pluto Temple in the north. The worst thing is that he is now in a position that is vulnerable to enemy attacks. This is bare, there is no terrain to hide. If there are any enemies, they have no choice but to fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is something coming!" Babe, who was sitting and resting, suddenly jumped up and pointed to the north. Everyone looked in the direction she pointed, but even Lev, who had the best eyesight, couldn't see anything from that direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's go north in a circle!" Babe said, but other people really can't see anything on the horizon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You're okay! Babe?" Lev walked over to the little girl. "Is it too tired, so I just fell asleep and dreamed?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am sober!" The little girl unhappyly pushed Lev's hand away. "They are coming soon, and it won't be too late!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They? Who are they?" Lev asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes? Who are they? Babe was asked by Lev’s question, what is going on? I suddenly knew that there was something coming over there, and it was something that was not good! It’s really inexplicable. Did you just fall asleep and dream? Babe was stunned. She couldn't understand where this clear feeling came from, but it still didn't leave in her mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They are coming? If we don't change direction, we will meet them in two hours!" Babe ignored Lev, loudly Said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two hours? How can I see things that are two hours apart? Lev sat down and ignored Babe. After all, the children did not lie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's okay! Babe, it's okay!" Elna held Babe's face with her hand. "Reassured, everything is fine!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't believe me!" Babe took off Elna. But in this case, who believes in the sudden inspiration of a little girl? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Close, near, it will appear!" The more I chanted in my heart, the more I went to the north, the more clear her feelings were. The number of those guys was about a few hundred, and the speed was not very fast. But she doesn't know why she feels this way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This strange feeling is really not wrong, just after a few minutes, a large number of squadrons appear in the adventurer’s field of vision, a human being The skeletons waved weapons and shields and rushed over them. Although they were psychologically prepared, it was quite scary to see a group of white bones. But there is no place to escape from hiding, there is no other choice than fighting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A standard blasting ball was immediately opened in the squadron, and the two summoners (???) of Warcraft immediately appeared in the direction of the squadron Storm over the past. It seems that this battle should not be too difficult. There are two ways that the squadron can't deal with Warcraft. The adventurer only needs to use the delay tactics to win. Maybe no one except the magician needs to shoot. Everyone just used the pullback...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A black energy column shot from the scorpion group, just hit the thick armor monster that is rushing forward, put this Warcraft hit a hole, black smoke floated from the wound inside Warcraft, in a short time, the red nose boss's Warcraft turned into a fly ash. Then another energy hit Babe's electro-optical World of Warcraft (temporarily called it). In an instant, the electric light warcraft had a big bang, and the whole bombing was gone, although the smashing rushed in front of several squadrons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Necromancer?!" Everyone who saw this scene knew what was coming, and the magician tried his best to kill a dozen with a blasting bullet. The sergeant, but the necromancer did not know where to hide, there was no way to find him. If the adventurers can find them, they will have a victory. As long as the Necromancer is killed, the Sergeant is not worthy of fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the adventurers opened their eyes and wanted to find the distinctive figure in the group, a new attack fell on their heads. The land under their feet was twisted. Before they understood what was going on, the adventurers were not at the foot of the adventurers. They were turned into quicksands, except for the exit of the soldiers. All other directions have been turned into a quicksand belt that is tens of meters wide. In other words, the adventurers are now temporarily trapped. Quicksand has no meaning for a magician who can fly, but it is an insurmountable obstacle for others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold consecutive acid balls fly over, acid balls can dissolve bones, not afraid of the necromancer to "reuse" with broken bones, but kill one or two The squadron did not make much sense to this squadron of about 500 troops. The squadron still rushed over. The other people stood in a row, blocking the offensive of the squadron and protecting the magicians and babe behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the combat effectiveness of the squad is not very high. This is correct! Lev thought while fighting. The thieves now find that these bones are nothing worthy of horrible, because even under the siege of the three squadrons, he can still dodge with ease, or even use the short sword to parry the enemy's weapons. The speed and response of the soldiers are slower than humans, although the power is not lost to humans. If it is not for a part of the mind to prevent the attack of the necromancer who does not know where to hide, the ten sergeants can't cope with themselves! After being accustomed to the rigid and rigid attack method of the squadron, Lev casually fell one of his legs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But other people are not as easy as thieves, the most prominent Wei attracts most of the attacks, although the squad’s movements are stiff and rigid, but the number If there is more than one, it will make people unable to fight. In particular, they completely disregard their own attack methods, so that many exquisite swordsmen can't display them. Fortunately, Behan's Earth Sword is now playing its best. Every energy shock can make several squadrons fragmented, but this is not enough to resist the swarming squad. After the formation of the melee, the adventurers began to form a regular match, wearing a heavy Wei and holding a shield red nose boss in the middle to resist the attack of the soldiers, Erna and Behan support from both sides, Lev Then pack up the individual squadrons that bypass the line of defense, and the magician provides fire cover behind. Because of the existence of the quicksand belt, the squadron can only come from one direction, and this battle line can block the squadron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Necromancer appears behind the squadron. He is brewing a new magic. Unlike gold, Kim must consider his companion when releasing magic, but the Necromancer does not care about the survival of the sergeant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides being on one side is packing up a column of sneak sneak Outside the husband, no one else noticed the appearance of the Necromancer. But what do you know about it? Although the soldiers can’t get there, the adventurers can’t imagine going out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warriors on the front line are now struggling, and the sword is not a weapon for attacking these bones, because the sword’s maximum power is not effective against the squad, if It’s much easier to turn weapons into hammers, axes, and the like before coming to the island, but it’s too late to say anything now. Although there is gold magic to support from behind, they are still forced to retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic of the Necromancer is displayed, this time is not the magic of the attack, but the effect is better than the attack magic. In the twinkling of an eye, the soldiers suddenly became flexible and changed their rigid and rigid movements. Their attacks became flexible and fierce. In a flash, the adventurers cooperated. The human beings had no other than the back. select. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold is now reassuring that he has just chosen the right one. He has been using very little acid bombs (a very simple single-point attack magic, the power is used to deal with it). A squadron is just right, and at the same time condensing the magic to deal with the quicksand around them, although the magic of the earth is his least good (his teacher is very good at magic, it is strange, but this is the truth), But he still completed the spell. When the companions retreated, the quicksand belt behind them had already returned to the hard ground. The pedestrians fought and went. Although they had some injuries, they had room for manoeuvre. Trapped in the middle of the quicksand is over - the situation is not too bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The squad is chasing after it. Without the quicksand, it may not be a good thing for the adventurer. The undead can now get back from the wings and the rear. The commander of the Necromancer, the Sergeant can also become a very dangerous opponent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fast escape!" In the back of the gold loudly called to his companion, he saw the danger of being surrounded by squadrons, but where can they escape? And there is no chance of victory without knowing the tired squad. After understanding the dilemma he is in, the magician decided to make the final effort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Babe, flee, here we will deal with it!" Kim ignored the little girl's answer, forced to push backwards, then turned and faced The sergeant. The adventurers are now divided into two parts, the first five are surrounded by a circle to resist attacks in all directions, followed by the magician and babe. The commander of the Necromancer was very good. After surrounded the first five, there were several bones coming to pick up the human magician who was most likely to pose a threat. At this moment of life and death, the magicians calm down. Some people have such qualities. When they are really dangerous, they can calmly judge and think. At this moment, Kim does not think that he can actually throw away his companions. The fact that flying magic escapes (of course, with Beibei). Kim understands that the explosive blast is his best choice. He ignores the approaching sergeant and calmly begins his prayers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fastest squadron of a rush rushed over, he waved the sword in his hand - a rust-covered weapon The magician slashed over. In order not to affect the spell, the magician just leaned over the body and avoided his own key. This saw-like sword left a terrible wound on the shoulder of the magician, but it was in the army. Before the sword was cut again, the spell was completed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behan sent out the last force of the Sword of the Earth - a burst of energy from the ground shattered the four squadrons - but The power of the sword of the earth has been exhausted, and there are still many soldiers. The position of the four squadrons was immediately filled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;End, Behan secretly complains, the sword of the earth is different from the sword of Wei, although the sword is not a weapon for dealing with the soldiers, but Wei can at least Destroy the sword as a stick, the sword of the earth can't, it's too light, although its own solidity and sharpness can make up for this deficiency (the sword is lighter and can't be weak). In the battle with the squadron, Behan could not play the advantage of the sword of the earth, and he did not wear the heavy armor without a shield. He could not support it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leif at Behan’s side is not as fast as it is. His situation is worse than that of Behan. He is not good at close combat and he has just dealt with it. The squadron is okay, but these guys suddenly become so agile, so that he can't afford it. Now he can't hide, because once he hides, he gives the sergeant a chance to attack his partner. His short sword is lighter than the sword of the earth. The combination of various reasons can explain why he has the most wounds now. His arms, thighs, and ears were all injured, and there was a lot of scratches on his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tiny explosive particles are now distributed in a spherical shape around the body of the gold, but the sergeant does not have the ability to see the changes around the body. He wants to continue to cut the sword, but his arm just touches a burst of blast particles, the next moment. The hand that he raised the sword, specifically the arm bone was blown into pieces. The other squadrons have already rushed at this time, but the explosive granules scattered in the air have become obstacles they cannot overcome, and the skeletons have become broken bones in the magic that Kim has not yet issued. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician suddenly realized the fact that he didn’t need to spend a lot of effort to drive these explosive particles, he only used the non-stop release of this deformed explosive ball. You can deal with the squadrons that swarmed. Although the squadrons rushed over one by one, they were not really warriors who could judge the situation. They were just stunned, and the forward rushing just made them can become fragments in magic faster. Although the result is brilliant, the magician can't support his companion now, and the blood flowing from his shoulder has already dyed his half of the robes. If you don't deal with the wound as soon as possible, you can have too much bleeding. His life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four sergeants bypassed the magician and approached the last babe, although Kim wanted to let Babe escape, but the little girl did not escape, she seemed to A little scared, standing there looking silly on the back of the magician, she actually could not escape when she found the squadron. The Ghost Master’s judgment is very correct, and no need to deal with this little girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Humanity seems to have no hope, and the Ghost Master believes that he has already won the game. He is beginning to approach the battlefield and continues to combine new squadrons there. The Ghost Master thinks that he has no need to take the shot. These human levels are not particularly strong. The opinion of the black robe is that these adventurers should be careful, but it seems that he is not correct. At this moment, the Ghost Master did not find that Kim was smashing his squad with a blasting bullet, nor did he notice that not all of the five people surrounded were poorly coped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The squadron came over to Beibei, the little girl looked left and right but couldn’t see the gap that would allow her to escape. It is "age", because their teeth have been lost, and their upper and lower jaws without teeth are constantly colliding while walking, as if they are laughing constantly, the deceased laughs at the living. The weapons inside these squadrons are very poor, but this does not hinder their ability to kill. At this moment, no one can help Babe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really is a very good qualification, without any formal training Actually, you can do this!” The sorcerer of the purple robe is now using magic to observe the battle far away from the battle site. When he sees that Kim has given up the chance to do the dodge attack in order to complete the spell. Can not help but issued such a sigh. "But it's just that you can't win. Come on, let me see your potential and see if you can stick to the end!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※ ※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Get out, don’t come over!” The little girl waved her hand desperately, although she was more courageous than her peers, but she was not at the moment. Not afraid, she knows what to do with the bones of these moving weapons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't come over..." But the soldiers didn't pay attention - in fact they couldn't hear it - the little girl's pleading, they continued to approach, finally It’s time to attack. Now the nearest magician from Babe is concentrating on the enemy, and no one notices the crisis of Babe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get out of the way! Immediately disappear from my eyes!" Just before the squad attacked, Babe suddenly yelled, accompanied by a cry. It is a powerful energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The squadrons who are swinging their swords have stopped their movements, not because he heard the sound of Babe, but now there are two forces of the same nature. Different orders are being sent to them, and two conflicting orders make them unable to make a judgment on what to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghost master’s vain body showed a wave of volatility, and the power released from Babe’s body also affected him – the power was irresistible Overwhelming majesty, even as a necromancer, he can't be unaffected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is this?" The ghost Master in the confusion began to explore the source of this power, and then he discovered that the root of this power is actually the most inconspicuous little Girl, he clearly feels the huge power attached to the little girl's body, it is not him, not even any necromancer can compete. The squadrons have begun to obey the more powerful forces, and they began to run around in all directions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of Pluto is directly exerted through the body of Babe, and does not require any mantra to process. Any magic that uses the power of Pluto has no way to directly confront it. After a meaningless resistance, the Ghost Master gave up the effort to regain control of the soldiers. When the Necromancer and the Scorpion are combined, the weaknesses of both sides can be compensated, and the advantages are strengthened, but if they are separated, they are no longer such terrible opponents. After seeing this unexpected situation, the Ghost Master decided to retreat first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The squadron retreated, but the adventurers did not react at the same time, they did not dare to pursue, for fear of this trap. However, this was before the squadron completely retired. When the bones blocking the line of sight dissipated and the black ghost mage appeared in the field of vision, the two figures immediately launched a storm. The Ghost Master made a mistake, he was too far ahead. Wei and Elna, who have been able to maintain strength throughout the battle, now have a chance. They don’t know that this strange retreat is not the intention of the Ghost Master. They understand the sudden departure of the soldiers as a large-scale A prelude to the magic attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two figures, one left and one right, rushed over to the Ghost Master, but the Ghost Master did not care, he had decided to retreat, so now he is gathering magic preparations Teleport. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people gathered together to defend the power, Wei began to release vindictiveness, and Erna also strengthened the power of healing, this ghost mage did not move. One can see at a glance that he is now preparing for magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, the power in the air is too much and too complicated! This problem was discovered when the Ghost Master used space to move magic. The power of Pluto, the energy of life, the power of the goddess of life, etc., meet together, although the space movement magic is displayed, but no effect occurs. The biggest weakness of the space series magic is that it is susceptible to interference, especially this space movement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic failed, and there is no time to use the new magic, the two enemies have already rushed to the side, the ghost mage wants to go backwards, but to be honest, he flutters The speed is really not comparable to the speed at which two enemies are rushing. Wei approached him, and Elna tried to get around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long sword cuts off the body wrapped in the black robe, but when the sword cuts the black robe, Wei does not have any feeling of cutting the real thing, and As rumored, the Ghost Master does not actually have any flesh, and it is different to use a sword to deal with them. In the next moment, Wei condensed his temper on the sword and issued the next attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master of the Ghost Master has a wave of turbulence under the impact of vindictiveness, and vindictiveness can indeed consume his vain body, but it is necessary to kill him by relying on it. impossible. The Ghost Master knows that he can't run away. Instead of being slowly and once again consumed by his enemies to consume his foggy existence, it is better to stop and use a magic to destroy the enemy. He suddenly stopped and turned to face Wei. Wei can now clearly see this legendary Necromancer - under the hood of his robes, it is a thick black mist like glue. Without this robes, no one can take this mist and It used to be a human necromancer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a flow in the black mist, and the Ghost Master was preparing his magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crisis! This is a feeling that has not been felt for a long time. Since I abandoned my human identity and became a necromancer, I have not felt it, but now this feeling has been awakened from the memory, only for the human body in front of it. Come out with this burning scent. This is the breath of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The human life is too weak, too easy to be destroyed, only a small plague, a not a big wound, or even a fall If you pay, you can let it be destroyed. It is just like the fire of a candle. I don't know when it is extinguished by the wind that I don't know where it is blowing. After thoroughly recognizing the powerlessness of life, the path of the undead that he resolutely chose overcomes the weakness of being a human being. But why, why are you better than human beings to fear the life of this human being? Life burns like a fire, but it is also easy to extinguish like a fire, and the necromancer is like the water of a deep pool. It never loses when it is never flowing. It is a higher existence than life. Why do you compare it? Are you more scared and fearful of life that is more likely to be destroyed? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fiery life flows out of the human body in front of him, and into the weapon in his hand, the power of life touches with his body, is melted, and is What is offset is that the body is more advanced than life. The weapon is constantly injecting new life force, but its own body has no way to supplement it. Every contact makes it shrink more. If you continue this way, you will Will be completely offset. I will be defeated. This thought does not know when it will appear. How can one who is more advanced than life be defeated by a living person? This is absolutely not allowed! Absolutely not allowed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an angry sorrow in the misty mage of the ghost mage. The fog is writhing and flowing, and a force is generated in this process. When Wei Suijian wants to slash again, the black from under the ghost mage hood In the deep fog, a column of dark energy is produced, and it is straight to the chest of the warrior. This is a terrible attack that eliminates the threat of two summoners. This power has no way to endure even Warcraft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark energy column hit the warrior's body from the front. The attack is so sudden, and the distance is so close. It is impossible to avoid it a little. When Wei realized that the enemy had launched an attack, his breastplate had already been hit by this force, but Wei did not feel any hit. If it was not seen by the eyes, he did not know that he had been hit. It is. Everyone else clearly saw that the energy was like ink, and the whole armor that had been exuded with metallic luster was dyed black. This black seems to engulf Wei. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boxing fighter who went to the front now launched an attack from the front (specifically, now behind the ghost mage), the opposite force to Pluto to the black robe The wrapped empty body slammed into the past, and easily smashed the robe that was not very strong, but the injury caused by Elna’s fist and Wei’s sword was similar, although it could offset the body of this ghost master. But can't give him a fatal blow. She did not stop the terrible energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ghost Master’s attack is finally over, but the human being in front is still standing still, and the armor on his body is still intact, without any gaps. The armor is now black, the black of the night sky, and one or two of the stars appearing in the sun from time to time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We looked down at my body in the middle of the stun, although the armor was dark, but it was obviously nothing, before the necromancer did not take any further action. The sword full of vindictiveness penetrates his body again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is it possible? Even the powerful magic of the power of the Wraith Tower can't overcome this life? This is the limit of the power of the grievance tower, and the power of the grievance tower cannot be used. Am I going to lose? Life is just a kind of depravity, full of those boring feelings, is a very low existence. Only when you become a dead soul can you get rid of the pain of life...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dad, hold me!" A little girl with a naive smile wobbled to her own In front of her, she is only five years old. It is a carefree age. She is so cute. Can she find something comparable to her in the world? I took this lovely little life with my full joy and put her little face on her face, let happiness fill this wonderful time. However, behind the happiness is the pain, the pain caused by the fragility of life. The daughter who is still playing with her in the morning disappeared from the world in the afternoon. She accidentally fell into the water...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ghost Master threw out the memory that was still left in the human world. He didn’t know why he suddenly remembered these old things. Is he still attached to the time that brought him pain? ? The most important thing now is to quickly destroy these two humans and then retreat... Yes, it is actually very simple to deal with them! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aerna cooperates with Wei, she can clearly feel The feeling above the fist, that is a feeling of playing in the water, she knows that this can hurt this necromancer, although not fatal, do not hit the core there is no way to give this ghost wizard a fatal blow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old magician once told them that the Ghost Master is actually attached to the tiny body fragments, as long as they can attack the black fog. Go to that core and you can destroy him. Wei repeatedly swords, hoping to have the opportunity to hit the core that does not know where it is, this is completely bumpy, but there is no better way to attack except to touch him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ghost Master retired to the left and turned to face two people. Two people want to chase forward, but find that their feet can't move. In the previous attack, they didn't even know when they were swamping. A swallow of seven or eight meters wide appeared at the feet of both of them. It passed over their calves, and there was a force coming down the swamp to pull them down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ghost Master floated in front of them, and their companions encountered several sporadic squadrons in the process of running, even if they ran Come over, they will not pose any threat to the Ghost Master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;daughter! In the process of drifting away, the Ghost Master kept on recollecting the memory that suddenly jumped into my heart. It was something that had been forgotten for a long time. But the round, sweet-smiling face is so clear whenever you think about it. It is impossible for these two enemies to catch up. His companions will not be able to survive for a while. The interference in the atmosphere has been weakened. Now there should be no problem with using instant movement. However, just using too much power, especially the Tower of Wraith, the load is too heavy. The rest of the power is only enough to use an instant move. By the way, do I still have human feelings? It’s a joke, it’s just to abandon the pain of human beings and become a dead soul...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A bunch of gorgeous holy inflammation was launched from a distance, hit the Ghost Master, and the ghost Master who had become weak under the attack of the power of vindictiveness and the power of the goddess of life has been unable to resist, and the flame is attached to the robe and burns wildly. The ghost-like body of the Ghost Master burned with the robe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Life is not what you think, you want to be a necromancer only But to escape, to avoid you encounter everything, you just can't face the painful coward!" Who said this, right, that old man, who is he? Forget it, who is not important anymore. Are you a necromancer just to escape the pain? This problem that has never been suspected has suddenly appeared again! Everything that has been done in the past is now appearing in my mind. My own hatred of human beings is for this reason. It is just that they are swearing, licking their happiness, and why they have not encountered the same misfortunes as themselves. So use your own strength to give them pain and make them suffer as much as you...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Sheng Yan bears burning, everyone sees that the flame is burning the ghost mage's robe and empty body at the same time. The flame has spread upwards, but this time the damn necromancer can't escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have never been separated from human feelings? So I have always been human? What am I? I have always believed that I am a dead soul, a more advanced existence than humans... Yes, in the past, the necromancer was once a part of human beings. Is this true? The so-called necromancer is only a branch of human beings? Yes, it must be like this. I am stupid. I believe that being a necromancer can be separated from everything...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame continues to burn, and now it has burned to the hood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, Vera, forgive your stupid father, I am just Can't face the fact that you lost you! You are such a baby to me, there is no glory for losing your life..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dad, as long as You understand it, come on, come here, we can be together forever here." A face with a sweet smile appeared in front of you, and a lovely little hand was extended...<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire body of the Ghost Master is burned clean by San Yan, nothing left. There is nothing wrong with Xiu Ke’s saying that Sheng Yan really has magic effects for the Necromancer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why is there no way to cure??" although Elna has exhausted Full of strength, but the wound on the magician is so slow to recover. Although the blood has stopped, the wound cannot be closed. After this unexpected victory, Elna began to treat the only severely damaged magician, but I don't know what happened. This wound is particularly difficult to heal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s weird!" Wei turned over and looked at the sword left by the soldiers. This weapon doesn’t look like it’s poisonous, nor does it bring anything. Magic power, this is just a broken and rotten weapon. Wei's armor is still in the dark and there are no signs of fading, but there is no other change besides the change in color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know", Lev stood up, although he was a little hurt, but it was some small wounds, no big problem. "Since the power of the Necromancer can be minimized near the Temple of the Goddess of Life, the Pluto Shrine must now minimize the power of the therapist..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Elna stood up and she knew that her strength could not help more. Lev said that there should be no mistakes. Since Leica can suppress the power of the Necromancer, it is not surprising that Pluto suppresses the power of the therapist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician stood up, his wounds were not bleeding, but it was still very early. This big wound is left in this way, no matter what it is, Elna takes out the bandage from the backpack - which was originally prepared for the purpose - and intends to wrap the gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, use this!" Lev has now taken out a green, smelling cool powder from his small bag. He first sprinkled a little on his wound and handed it over. "Sprinking on the wound is very helpful for recovery!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This powder is effective, just sprinkle it, the pain of the wound is quickly driven away, After the bandage was wrapped, Kim felt that his arm could be used freely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, these things are all taught by Mr. Locke. In addition to the therapeutic powder, there are some things that can be used in combat, but unfortunately The Necromancer is useless."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The group continues on the road, and all the way to discuss is the luck of the battle. If the necromancer is not making a mistake, then this may be over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The guy is too anxious, actually wants to chase the squadron and use magic to solve us together! If he continues to let the squad attack, we may now Already joined the Undead Legion! It’s a good luck!!” At this moment no one knows why the Scorpion really lost control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The signal that the Ghost Master was destroyed was immediately felt by the black robe, fact Above, this signal was felt by all the necromancers on the undead island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why don't you listen to me, I want you to try it out, not let you decide with them!" The black robes of the undead wizard muttered to himself . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are some more in front!" Babe suddenly in front of the finger, Say to everyone. ]<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is coming, is it the undead?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The same thing as before! Beibei did not answer positively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that battle with Babe’s prophecy, everyone did not say it in the mouth, but I already believed that this little girl did have some kind of induction. Perceive the actions of the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When will you come?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"About half an hour later!" Girls don’t know why they know these things. It seems to be as clear as I can see with my own eyes! The adults exchanged their eyes and they decided to believe the intuition of the little girl once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seven or eight undead wizards carry absolutely no less than three thousand The soldiers passed by at the limit of the adventurer's vision. When they saw the lineup of the undead, everyone couldn't help but take a breath. You know, if you don't listen to Babe, they must be in touch with this undead army at the moment. The result of the battle, we don't have to think about it. The magician now uses a magical array, with a magical cover and distance, the necromancers are not aware of their goals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Great, babe, you are amazing!" The army that watched the undead slowly left, and Lev happily hugged the little girl and kissed him. In one bite, with the talent of Babe (???), Undead Island can be as safe as the back garden. But Babe did not welcome this kind of intimacy, she broke hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, Beibei, tell my sister, how do you know that the undead are coming?" Elna squatted down, and she still had a little doubt in her heart. Bei has never shown the power to predict, but how suddenly he knows the actions of the Necromancer? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know, I just know!" Babe seems to be troubled by this sudden exposure. correct! Erna suddenly remembered the thing in the city of Delante. At that time, Babe suddenly burst out of the power of Pluto. Could it be... impossible, no matter from which angle, Beibei is a human being, one can eat. Drinking, the little girl who will run away, except for the talent (?) as a summoner, is no different from ordinary little girls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a pyramid-shaped building, huge, dark, exudes a sense of death, which is compatible with the necromancer from any angle. Those who accept this kind of thing and use it as their own temple are only those gods who have mastered death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is the temple of the Pluto?" The thief made an incredible voice. In the hearts of ordinary people, the temple should be dignified and luxurious, with white marble pillars and gold. The gorgeous buildings built by the decorations. Although this is the Temple of Pluto, it is also made by mankind. It should not be bad. And, out of fear of death, this temple will be more brilliant. The difference between the appearance of the temple and the building on the map is really different. Too big, it seems that in the past years, the Necromancer has made a lot of transformations to this temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold took the map out and saw it and threw it on the ground. If the appearance changed, the interior of the temple must be completely different from this picture. This map is meaningless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Would you like to go in?" Lev looked back at everyone and swallowed a hard time. To be honest, the risk of entering this temple is too great, even if Babe knows where the undead comes from, but if you don't know the road, you will be blocked by the undead in the dead end. Now that the retreat is still too late, with Babe, they will not be in danger if they leave...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "All come here, can you still go in?" Behan replied with a sneer, and he looked at the melancholy in Lev's heart—or oh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no cover in the outer circle of the temple, and Babe clearly tells you that there are "many" undead in this temple, but there is no other choice. Under the cover of magic that the magician sacrificed a lot of magic to make a circle around this huge building, I wanted to find an entrance. What is most feared now is that the undead have sentinels, so that these people can never escape the eyes of the sentinel - if the undead have eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where!" The sharp-eyed babe pointed at the door of an inconspicuous black scorpion. This door is very small and does not match the size of this temple. It is a partial door, but it is a good entrance for this group of uninvited guests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's amazing!" Lev sighed the door of Mo, which was made of unknown materials and was black. Glossy strange crystals. Others have already entered, and Lev is used to looking around, pulling out a knife and dropping a small piece from the door and putting it in his pocket, then quickly catching up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The queue doesn't know when it becomes the lead, the little girl is in front, the others are behind. This passage is very dark, although I can't see my fingers, but I can barely see things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a flash of light in front of it, and it seemed that the end of the passage had arrived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't move!" Babe suddenly said, everyone stopped and stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before," Babe pointed to a position less than five steps in front of him. "There is a trap, a dangerous trap!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where?" Wei stepped forward, his eyes were used to the darkness, and the position of the babe's fingers was no different from the other parts, but since Babe said this, although he could not see When they came out, everyone did not dare to move forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let me give it a try!" Lev grabbed something from the ground and threw it at the place where Babe pointed. The thing fell to the ground, but actually there was no land. A blue flame immediately swelled up, illuminating the surrounding area. Under the light of the fire, it was clear that the thing was actually a human skull. But this skull is about a fifth of a second in sight, because it immediately turns into a black smoke under the energy of the trap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Unlucky!" Lev immediately rubbed the hand that had caught it on the wall, but the wall had a terrible feeling, and the thief couldn’t help but make a sound. Scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound is not very large, but it is enough in this silent passage. The attention of any audible thing, each adventurer immediately put his hand on the weapon, and everyone's eyes are concentrated on Lev. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This...this wall..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician boldly reached out and touched the wall, and the hand came up with a soft and moist touch. The magician retracted his hand, but saw a layer of mucus attached to his hand, and the crystal was bright. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is this?" Under the illumination of the ball of light, the things under the feet are also very clear. In this channel, there are many on both sides. Scattered bones, human bones. All the bones were scattered on both sides of the passage as if they had fallen from the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where are we?" Kim suddenly felt an ominous premonition, and he felt his hair was upside down. This place, this place is a trap! ! ! As if to verify his own hunch, Kim’s hand suddenly felt a burning sensation. He didn’t need to look to know that the liquid that had just stuck to his hand had a corrosive effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A burst of vibration came, under the illumination of the ball of light, everyone saw that the passage was shrinking and narrowing, and the wall was gathering like the center. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The front is an insurmountable death trap, the latter exit is too far away, and the pedestrian is now a mouse in the cage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come on, I don't believe you can live alive!" "The face in front of a crystal ball is gnashing." This crystal ball has a limited range of surveillance and cannot convey power. It is a bargain made in the Holy Light Dynasty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three swords are pulled out almost at the same time, piercing the soft wall, when When the sword is pulled out, a yellow liquid is also ejected, just as the creature is bleeding from the injury. But this tiny damage is not enough to stop the contraction of the wall. This strange thing continues to shrink, close, and the viscous liquid begins to secrete a lot from the wall surface, if the flesh and blood and this full dissolve If the liquid is in contact with the wall, then...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We will be digested!" Jin’s brain suddenly remembered the word digested, he had already tried There are several magics, but in order not to hurt my own people, I can't exert all my strength, and I can't stop the wall from continuing to shrink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, everyone has almost nothing to do, this channel they have just walked about fifteen minutes, at least three kilometers, at least A huge trap, ordinary attacks are almost ineffective. The damage caused by the sword is just the same as the damage caused by the cow hair. At the current speed, they can enjoy these corrosive mucus in about three minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gold, think of a way!" The thief continued to use the sword to stab a face to the magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have no way!" The magician put a thunderbolt energy into this creepy weird trap, but this life is like (it seems to be) The size of the trap is his best defense, and this level of blow is ineffective. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The magic trap in the front must be solved, or we will be finished!" The voice does not know who called it. In fact, this is perhaps the most correct. Choice, the time to turn back is too late, only forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To break this magic trap is actually very simple, first determine his attributes, then use the magic opposite to the attribute to consume his energy. (Note: You can't use the magic of the same attribute, otherwise it will give him energy.) The magician was guided by this and immediately understood how to do it. He tried his best to put all the distracting thoughts out of his mind and let the prayers emerge from the depths of memory. Although the magician can now feel all kinds of sprites, he can't distinguish the attributes of the magic trap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the name of the compassionate goddess of dawn, I am here to offer prayers of sincerity, please give me the power to see through the roots of all things, attached to us Above the eyes of the dust!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is it possible!" The blonde lamented that his magic now does not see the source of the power of this trap, or this magic. There is no way to judge the properties of the trap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Use one of the strongest things to induce the energy of this trap!" Babe suddenly cried. "Only this method can deal with this trap!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am in the past!" Wei replied that it is indeed vindictive to resist all known magic, whether it is issued by a spell or buried in a trap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The most sturdy thing!" Behan immediately thought of the sword of the earth in his hand. The material of the magic weapon is the most carefully selected. It should be sturdy, although this may make this sword fly. Oblivion, but there are no more choices at this time...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Behan intends to throw the sword of the earth, another person moves better than him. A little faster, Wei Xian threw the Demon Sword to the top of the trap, although this sword may be the only hope for revenge for him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame of blue is rising again, this time the goal is this sword, the energy is constantly colliding on the sword, trying to destroy this thing completely, The energy is very strong, and the rising hot air holds the sword in the air. In the dazzling blue fire, the blade began to become transparent and more transparent, as if it had to be transformed and erased in essence. Just as everyone thought that the sword was about to disappear, the flames went out, and the demon sword fell on the black marble floor with a bang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there nothing?" Lev wants to move forward, but he immediately retreats after taking a step. He picks up one from the ground and is not taken by those. The bones that the corrosive liquid touched (when people are in danger, they can't take care of others) throw them over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bones fell to the side of the sword, but did not cause any accident. The blue flame did not rise again, and the magic trap was consumed (not destroyed). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is rushing forward with the fastest speed, the light in front is indeed an exit, before the creepy, sticky wall is closed, all the people They have all escaped from this rat cage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is it possible that these guys are really lucky? The care of this?" Brett watched the queue out of the surveillance of the crystal ball, but there was nothing to do. There are more than one magic trap here, but because of his stupidity, the traps that need to be triggered are now useless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing wrong with the magic sword, at least there is no visible eye on this weapon. The damage that can be distinguished, Wei made the above conclusion while looking at his weapon. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team is now in a bright corridor, surrounded by marble floors and columns and ceilings, the corridor is very bright, but this is not the result of the sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After coming out of the same channel as the cage, they found themselves in an "airborne" corridor with only one marble corridor that could not be seen. The top, bottom, left and right are empty, and all sides are shining brightly, so that there is no way to see the light source of these lights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this is not the most terrible Pluto temple on the island of the undead, everyone will be amazed at this spectacle, but now, everyone’s heart is only The feeling of a new trap. Babe walked and ran while walking, while others followed closely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Babe, be careful, I don't know what will happen here!" Elna shouted in the back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing, there are no strange things here," Babe ran in front and replied loudly, "Don't worry, I have been here!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Have??” Erna was taken aback, but she quickly ignored this rather important sentence because they had come to the end of the corridor. . This long corridor is like a bridge directly on two cliffs. There is an entrance in front of it. The thick scent and bloody smell float out from the entrance that is indistinguishable from the door of the ordinary house, reminding the outsiders. The danger of this place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think, we are at the core!" Kim said to his companions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Everyone should be careful!" Behan nodded and pulled his sword out of his waist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The group continues to move forward, and here is really the feeling of "the temple", although those smells are always reminding these intruders. Almost everyone is now relying on Babe to lead the way, because no one knows how to go, the passages and corners are so much more complicated, and everyone has to make road signs at each fork. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
