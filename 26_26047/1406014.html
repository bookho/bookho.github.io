			<div id="content">Lost in the mainland of the mainland in July 998, next to a mountain trail on the border of the Leite Empire, a team of people are ambushing here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a trail, but it’s actually a well-renovated road, because this road used to be the main thoroughfare of the mountain, but with A new, better shortcut to the development, this road has begun to gradually become desolate, and many weeds have begun to appear in the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This group of people is divided into three teams, hiding in the deep and dense roads of the forest, seems to be waiting for something to come. But this road has basically been abandoned. Only a few familiar local talents use this road, and outsiders generally take the new road! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three crisp cuckoos came and echoed in the quiet mountains! This sound seems to be a kind of signal that makes this group of ambushes bring their spirits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first team consists of two people who hide in a bush that is not very large, cleverly hiding the body completely in the shrub! Both are the same equipment, bows, swords, and leather. The difference is that the young one looks very nervous, and the older one is obviously calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The goal is coming!" said the older man, then he turned his face to his young companion. "Hey, now you have to move your hands and feet, lest wait." If you are paralyzed, you can't move!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reassure! Come on," a young one answered, "There will be no such problem, but I suspect... ...your plan can be successful! Our number is too small, only twenty people!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are only five of them! And, too many people If you get it, everyone will be less!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But they are strong, they are too strong, so many bounty hunters have failed..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you scared? Don't beware, kid, we are behind the jungle that is suitable for escape. Even if it fails, it must be able to escape!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sharp and long cuckoo came and then it was again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The goal has been determined! We have been waiting here for two days without waiting! Oh, I can get away almost all the treasures of the Royal Treasure! Can get the treasures in their hands, plus their own reward amount, even if twenty people, ten life can not be used!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A team of people appeared in the ambush's line of sight, and all the nerves of the people began to tighten. They all know the strength of these guys. If the first wave of attacks fails, they will pay a terrible price even if they win! Although oneself is four times more than the opponent, a big magician plus a sword saint is enough to offset the gap in these numbers, and these people are terrible things that can safely come back from the undead island, not to mention that they used to be German. The champion of the Randbi contest! More news pointed out that it was they who eliminated the horrible criminals in the cursed desert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Twelve warriors, two magicians!" The man named Renn began to measure his strength, and he most hoped to be the first wave of bows and arrows. The magical sneak attack can disintegrate the combat power of about half of the opponent. In this case, you can probably catch a few live, and those treasures that don't know where they are hidden can get it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man started to come closer, the leading one was a warrior wearing a fiery red armor. Although he was covered with an ordinary traveler's cloak, he still covered it. Can't live with his conspicuous armor. This guy should be the Juggernaut, and there are monsters in this armor walking long way! However, in such a close distance, even the body armor can not resist the shooting of the bow and arrow, the only worries is whether the armor is the magic armor taken out of the treasure chest, in which case the bow and arrow may be invalid! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come and use the slowest movement to slowly put the arrow on the bow, and try to calm your breathing, so as not to alarm the enemy. The soldier passed by the bushes without warning and began to walk to the main ambush. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One foot, two feet... Come and slowly, very quickly, already five feet have passed, the enemy has entered the ambush, but When the time is not up, he is responsible for preventing the enemy from escaping. They cannot be exposed until the main attack is launched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feet suddenly stopped, which made the spirit of the shock, it will not be discovered by those guys! impossible! He is very confident in his hidden skills, his nephews are doing just as well, and will never be discovered. If found, it must be those who are ambushing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But those feet started to act again, it seems that the hiding of those guys has not been seen! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let’s breathe a sigh of relief, he looked at the nephew around him, the young man had already set the arrow, he made a gesture of no movement, then Raise your head a little and look at the situation of those who step into the ambush circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swordsman, magician, magic swordsman, thief, therapist, really fucking is a gold combination, both can fight hard battles A long-lasting battle, if it is not an ambush raid, it is probably difficult to deal with them, but if you can use a bow and arrow to flatten the magician, or use magic to clean up the thieves and the swordsman, the victory is very sure, of course, this is the ideal The best situation! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal seems unprepared to the center of the ambush circle, the only difference is that the distance between them has been greatly reduced due to the pause. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people clenched their bows and opened half of the bowstrings. In this case, you can shoot at the fastest speed when you jump up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal is to move forward, then the red-sworded swordsman who took the lead pulled out his sword without warning, before all the ambush responded, he The sword in the handle danced quickly, and several swords winded into the grass on the side of the road. The invisible wind blade revealed their trajectory in the grass of half a person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This blow was sudden and violent, completely disrupting the pre-arranged raid plan, although causing any casualties, but in order to avoid the Jianfeng, the ambush had to move It is clearly exposed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five people all rushed up, and in this close distance, the bow and arrow also lost their effect, only face-to-face contests. The ambush knows this. They decisively drop the bow and arrow and pull out the weapons. In any case, they still have an advantage in terms of numbers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Up!" Come and decisively throw away the bow and arrow and pull out the long sword and rushed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two sides fought together, two magicians wrapped around the great magician, seven people besieged the red swordsman, and the rest were on the plan. Their respective opponents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Len and his nephew attacked the thief, the guy was very sensitive, but under the joint attack of two people, he still left and right, and then retreated, only The threat is that this guy seems to be a good knife, but after the first knife was opened by the sword<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he was attacked by two people again The opportunity to use a flying knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let’s move fast, the sword stabbed the other’s chest, the guy separated with a short sword, and the other hand stretched over the belt, but he still hasn’t The opportunity to pull out the knife, another sword arrived, a slap in the face forced the other hand to shrink, followed by a series of rapid spurs, forced him to retreat, separated him from his companions, the thieves were forced to retreat to the depths of the grass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Win!" After the young man forced the guy away from his companion, he came to him behind him, forming a front and back attack, as long as Without giving him the chance to fly a knife, this guy has nothing to fear, and now he can solve him with just one hit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was ready to give an unexpected blow to the guy who was unprepared behind him, he suddenly felt a strange feeling in his foot, and he couldn’t help it. I took a look at my feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A green snake that has never been seen is under his feet, wrapped around his lap, the evil little eyes are watching him, the snake The mouth opened, and the red letter stretched out and faintly saw the long fangs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snake bite down on the belly of the foot, and even can clearly see how the fangs penetrate the pants and penetrate the skin! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah!" The leg was filled with a terrible pain, so that he felt the softness of his feet. He waved his sword to the python, but the snake was muddy. It was as slippery and disappeared into the grass before the Jianfeng arrived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old adventurer’s voice called the two people who were fighting next to him to sneak a bit, and then, similar calls began to come one after another, many people The feet were all kissed by snakes. These snakes don't know where to come out and start attacking the lower body of these fighting humans. Perhaps one of them has stepped on the snake's den and angered these dangerous animals! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ambushes quickly retreated backwards into the depths of the forest. It is of paramount importance to treat snake venom. After all, money is lifeless. In just one or two minutes, they all disappeared into the dense forest, so that the other party could not catch up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The damn snake!" Come and run while he squats. He knows that the violent activities are easy to spread the snake venom, and the pain from the feet seems to be stronger than a burst. "What a hell, how can this place come out of a snake's nest!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They didn't chase, take a break here!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone sat down and took off the leather pants and boots at the fastest speed, while taking out some simple antidote from the pocket forever in case of emergency. And the holy water blessed by the goddess of life, first eat the antidote, drink a little holy water, and then wash the wound with holy water, the snake poison can be basically removed...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strange? Why are there no wounds? The bite of the detoxification in the mouth, the holy water bottle in the hand opened half of the Enron, only to find that there is no wound on his leg. The legs are very smooth, not swollen by poison, and I can't see the two bleeding holes that were bitten by the snake... In fact, nothing, except for some hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened?" He looked up and found that everyone had the same problem with him! Everyone can't find a wound bitten by a snake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's illusion!" A magician called and everyone turned to look at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This must be the illusion used by the great magician. I have heard that higher illusions can not only confuse the vision, but also confuse the sense of hearing and touch...but These should be knowledge that has disappeared! There is only one record in the book..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Imaginary! Really fucking hell! We were actually deceived Defeated!" After confirming the wound on the leg, the pain did not know when it disappeared. Come and wear your pants and boots and stand up! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's not a trick, it's a branch of magic... It can be both magical and tactile, it's awesome magic..." the magician said, but come En ignored, he must immediately re-energize morale, although this failed, but has not completely failed, everyone basically did not suffer any injury, the only one is to burn half of the hair by the warrior's flame magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter, we have another time. Everyone will start quickly and cut off the road. They should be able to catch up with them. Be careful this time, first flatten the magician with bows and arrows. ......" Come to pay attention to everyone's mood is not high, this failure can be said to be lucky, if you fight again, the failure must be them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who is it?" The sound of rustling came from the woods, and he was shocked and asked aloud. With his voice, a body wearing armor appeared. In front of everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are you?" Come back and take a step back, rather than standing in front of the individual is better than the armor, the body of the person, including the face All of them are shrouded in a tight steel cover, revealing only a pair of eyes, and the killing is revealed from the eyes. This armor was never seen by Grace, but he can be sure that this armor is not made by humans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person did not answer, just raised his hand The broad sword, the sword reflected the cold cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Len again retreats and pulls out the long sword. At this time, everyone pulls out the weapon and gathers, although this guy looks weird, but There are so many people in this area, there should be no problem...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guy is rushing over the sword, and he is also a sword, this guy has only one person, As long as you block a few times, your companion can form a close relationship with him...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s weird, how do you fly high, it’s your own body, it’s weird How can I see the back of my body...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the grace flies into the sky, when the head has not yet landed, the stranger’s The sword has already been stained with new blood...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The open space in this forest is now an abattoir, and twenty bodies are lying on the ground, big Some of them are headless, and the blood stains the green grass. In the face of this concrete death, life is as fragile as ceramics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These corpses should not be found by people. Who would go to a group of adventurers who have nowhere to go and no fixed residence? The only thing everyone knows is that they had planned to attack the wanted criminals of the DeLand Empire. If they disappeared from the world, then everyone would think of these two things together. The Adventurers’ Union would make this judgment. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The massacre began to walk deep into the woods after determining his own achievements. The sword in his hand was still cold after the killing, a drop of blood. Also not contaminated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five adventurers, no, now should be called a wanted criminal, right Sitting on the side of the road to rest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is very tired, they have been on the road since leaving DeLand, but their legs are not bonfires and pigeons are fast, leaving DeLand Less than ten days in the city, their wanted order was spread throughout the country. The reward of 200 magic crystal coins can make any adventurer who wants to make a fortune feel, although the action is secret, as far as possible, without going all the way, and around a lot of bends, but in less than a month, they are at least fifteen After the ambush, the intelligence of the Adventurer’s Union is really terrible! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How many times?" The thief asked, he was the weakest link in every battle, the Adventurer's Union had his entire material, and the attackers never Let him show the stunts of flying knives. If it wasn't for the magician who always showed the magical illusion at a critical time, he would have hung up! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thirteenth..." The magician replied on the side, this wanted order is really embarrassing, they actually did nothing, strictly speaking, Things are not yet! Fortunately, in the training on the island of Undead, he mastered a lot of illusion skills, although it can not cause the level like Nubis, but in the melee, everyone can use it when they have no time to distinguish it, but it has a good effect. These thirteen battles ended before the real casualties of the two sides, relying on the merits of illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't expect to encounter an ambush here!" Wei first stood up, and for him, the rest was enough. The enemy of this battle just now is the highest enemy they have encountered, even if he does not find the enemy. If it weren't for the two magicians who were brewing magic and the elf's unusual activities were discovered by Kim, they would probably be baptized by a wave of bows and arrows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, it’s all over the country, but this time should be over. The wanted order is useless in the territory of the Reiter Empire. There is no regular army. After the hunt, we can go on the road to see who dares to attack us!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is that really true?" When Kim said this sentence At the time, everyone was silent. In fact, everyone knows that such a huge bounty is really tempting. For those who pursue money, it doesn't matter where it is. The key is how to get the money! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's go, everyone will go to the border of Leite, then we can have a good rest, we have not slept in bed for so many days. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is standing up, although very tired, but the longer it stays in this place without people, the more dangerous, who knows when those guys just come back! As long as they are in the territory of the Leite Empire, these bounty hunters should not be so brazen to launch an attack! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pedestrian re-entered the road, the magician and Wei walked in the end, and Kim walked and added magic to Wei’s armor. The armor given by the elder Long is really amazing. It can store the magic released by others for the owner. After so many days of experimentation, Wei has basically mastered the use of this armor, and has been able to control and use the magic stored on the armor, and can combine sword and magic in battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original armor that has turned into a light red becomes white under the magical spell of a magician, and the crystal clear white, this time attached to the armor It's ice magic! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One month’s escape career is finally over, over the last mountain After that, the borders have been left behind, and they have entered the territory of the Leite Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The front of the gate is still a fixed notice board, but don't worry about anything unexpected on the notice board now! They have already passed the border, and even if they are attacked, they will not be blatantly happening! This period is really not a person. If you don't experience it personally, no one can think of being so painful because it is wanted. Let's not say that you can't go straight into the city, even the wilderness villages dare not stay! The road did not dare to go, only to choose a small road, to see someone on the road to be afraid, for fear of being reported, no one on the road should be more careful, do not know when will jump out of a group of bounty hunters to launch a raid. Everyone only buys food and equipment when people are in need, but even so, they still encounter more than a dozen sudden attacks along the way! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha... finally, let's go to a hotel, have a good meal, then take a shower and sleep in a comfortable bed..." Lev actually said everyone's The voice, because this month's escape career makes everyone feel tired, except for one person, everyone needs a good rest! Compared with other people, Wei did not think that this trip, he has long been used to fatigue and danger and fighting. Gradually mastering the use of this armor brings more excitement and joy than everything else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three people sitting around the table, drinking slowly and quietly Drink. After a brief period of relaxation, it is time to discuss what to do next. In fact, in a sense, the common goal of bringing this group together has disappeared! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alna is still in the room, Lev has gone outside to check the news, this month's escape, their news has been completely cut off Even Delante’s specific circumstances for their rewards are not very clear. Three people sat at the table and enjoyed this rare moment of leisure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door of the hotel was opened, and several passengers who seemed to be adventurers came in and talked and walked through the hall and walked to their room. Behind them, Lev also came in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three people looked at Lev, and Lev’s face had a strange smile. He came to the table and pulled an empty chair. Sit down and put a piece of paper on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The latest news from the mainland? Are you going to the adventurer's union?" The magician asked, he really has no good feelings for the adventurer's union, no doubt, The many sneak attacks they have on the road are all the consequences of the well-informed traders’ union. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's take a look..." Lev opened the paper so that everyone could see it clearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most striking place on the list clearly reads "Dike's army is attacking the half-orc through the half-orc wilderness!" Listed some information about this military action! It is reasonable to have this message in the most prominent position, because this is the first time human history has taken the initiative to cross the Orc Wilderness to attack the Orcs, but it is not this that adventurers are concerned about right now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this most conspicuous position, it clearly reads "The five gangsters who robbed the state treasury with the highest bounty in the mainland" Below this line, the amazing reward amount is written in bold: 200 magic crystal coins. Below the reward amount, there are portraits and names of five people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold gently read the above words, "As long as you can bring any of the five people to the city of Delante, you can get 40 magic crystal coins, the deceased Half-cut, three-year effective. Every time he reads a word, he feels a chill in his back. This reward amount can make anyone who is interested in money shine with his eyes. No wonder he has encountered so many attacks along the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four people were silent for a while, although they thought that they might be rewarded with a high amount of money, but did not expect to have reached the point of "live and die" plus astronomical figures. Things are more serious than you think, and everyone's face has sunk! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's the matter?" A voice came out, the female therapist came out of the room, she had just showered, and the wet hair was unconstrained. She was covered on the shoulders, and she did not wear a full set of therapist's gowns as usual. The collar, the cloak, and the petticoat were not worn. There was only a tight dress and trousers. The reason why this is mainly because the bathroom of this hotel is public, and the bathroom and passenger room must pass through the hall! Elna just came out of the bathroom and was about to go to her room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the people in the hall are attracted to this woman, including her four companions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a completely different style of peace, although the usual Erna can not be said to be unattractive, but even for the pursuit of the man who is close to her They also often lost their original purpose and only used her as a good partner for adventure and forgot her gender. But at this moment, Elna showed out the female side... The water drops on the hair reflected the light, like a pearl, the tight clothes set off a well-developed body, and the delicate facial features match the bath. The rosy complexion and the inadvertent stroke of the hair are enough to make a fatal attraction for a man! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alna naturally put her hair together by hand, and then noticed the unusual atmosphere, she noticed that everyone concentrated The sight on her body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician gently kicked the two companions who had not returned to the gods with their feet, and then coughed heavily. This cough awakened everyone like a lightning strike. Most people looked away from Elna. The body turned back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alna snorted and seemed to understand something, and she hurried to the second floor room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the people in the hall turned their attention back and began to talk loudly about topics that were completely unrelated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four people sit a bit sly, or the silence that Lev broke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you feel that you are not right?" He said in a voice that only his companions could hear, "It seems that we live in a store with us...we may be too People pay attention to it... This shop seems to have no ordinary guests...all adventurers!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No murderous!" Wei replied, he also started A little alert, if the store is a risk-taking person can also use "coincidentally" to explain, but after seeing a woman who makes a man stunning, no one actually discusses this topic - no matter from which point of view is not like It is the literacy level of the adventurer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only explanation is that people here already know their identity! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leif put his hand on the belt, and Kim also picked up the magic wand leaning against the table. Wei’s hand was also moved to and the magic sword was within reach. Distance, after suddenly thinking of all kinds of unusual signs, everyone is alert, the people around are so suspicious! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Relax!" Behan made a gesture, "Even if you come for a bounty, you won’t be open in the city during the day!" In this way, even if it is a high reward from another country, as long as it is not a prisoner in this country, it will not be openly attacked. If there is such a person who does not know how to get along, I am afraid that he will soon become a wanted criminal. After thinking of this, everyone’s hands have left the weapons. They are safe now, at least temporarily safe. This kind of city near the border, the security during the day is guaranteed, but in the night...<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people around me are talking about topics that are completely irrelevant, and it looks no different from ordinary hotel restaurants. No one pays special attention to the four sitting together. People - no one seems to notice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, there is a very strange thing," Lev suddenly thought of "when I was at the adventurer's union, I heard a thing, good. Like those who have attacked us all disappeared... At present they have all been taken to be killed by us..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Missing? Maybe in battle It’s inevitable to die a few, after all, they launched a surprise attack on us, but all disappeared...” The magician felt vaguely wrong, and there seemed to be something hidden behind it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steps on the stairs, the eyes of the people in the hall were unconsciously attracted to the past, and Erna came down from the stairs. She is now dressed very well. Wearing a therapist's gown that completely conceals her figure. After putting on this robes, the seductive youthful atmosphere that made men look silly was hidden, although it could not be said to be not beautiful, but it lost the power that was enough to attract all men’s eyes. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alna went to the table and sat down, looked at the four people, and the four companions felt a strange groan, and for a moment they didn’t know what to say. feel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do we do next!" Kim finally spoke. Now is not the time to silence. There are problems that must be solved. The list has been placed on Aier. In front of Na, she has also seen the reward announcement above. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This area is still very unsafe at the border...we must stay away from the Delante Empire! So, let’s go to the capital city of Leite, never sleep, everyone thinks How about?” The magician suggested, and at the same time glanced at the people around him. “There will be no such people to follow there!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold sound control It's very light, but it can be heard clearly by the companions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I agree..." Wei spoke. "If someone attacks us here, it is easy to escape to Delante unless we are far away." Far away from Delante, otherwise, our situation is still very dangerous!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But... now is the afternoon, is it early from the dark?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone is very tired, rest early, hurry tomorrow morning Wei said while walking upstairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't be, go to sleep!" Others also Then stood up, Lev walked over the side of Kim, took a picture of his shoulder, and Kim raised his head, just to see that Lev made a look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five people have gone upstairs, and even Elna, who just took a cup and took a drink, went up, just in the hot lobby. The child calmed down, sitting in the hall and watching each other, did not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there a flaw?" I don't know who said this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This hotel is not very big, the second floor is the guest room, the first floor is used as a hall, after five people have gone up the stairs, there is no one below Keep up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that the whole hotel is inside... No, maybe outside are those who plan to catch us! Lev, you are not seeing the outside. Is it the place? Is it the adventurer's union? It's weird, it's too much..." Behan put his head out a little from the window of the stairway, but immediately shrank back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Impossible, the adventurer's union will only sell intelligence and news...it's not..." Lev suddenly thought of something, "Right, I listen." The rumors that we ransacked the Deland treasury... Ah... not so miserable..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It looks like this!" Elna also Looking outside, "We seem to be the target of all those who want to make a fortune... It’s a period of uncertainty. There are many adventurers in the border city who are going to be mercenaries! Our rewards are already high, plus I believe that we took away the treasures of the Deland treasury..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who wants to make a fortune?" Wei said to himself, then he suddenly turned to face the magic Teacher, "Gold, immediately use some strong magic on my armor, wait until the evening... Maybe you don't have to wait until the evening, these spells will come in handy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Powerful magic? But if you do this, it will also hurt you! Remember us Is the experiment at the beginning? Although the armor can absorb and store magic, but it can't completely block the magic! It doesn't matter if it is a weak spell, but if it is a strong spell, it won't work!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reassure, my body's resilience... If it's normal damage, it will recover soon! There is still time, it's too late when it's dark! Right. "We turned to Behan, "How many people are there?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With the downstairs, there will be no less than one hundred... No, Two hundred!” Behan lowered his head and seemed to be carefully estimating. “Too much... odious, if you don’t walk a little more, you’ll be fine!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five people have been surrounded, and when they have been asleep at the hotel for a while, the encirclement has already formed, and even from the time they enter the gate, they are already in the eyes of the hunter. . This mistake can actually be avoided. If it is a group of old-fashioned bandits, a group of people who have stayed on the wanted order for several years will definitely not just go beyond the border of the country where the order is issued. The city, unfortunately the adventurers are not wanted overnight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no one other than them upstairs, although the room has been fixed for a long time, but now it is all empty. An entire hall of adventurers, a deserted hotel room, a group of people outside the hotel who are standing with weapons and standing, everything is so obvious, no longer need to doubt again, the question is only when Launch an attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From the window at the end of the corridor, rushing out! There are the fewest people there!" Behan suggested that instead of waiting for others to launch an attack, it’s better to do it first. What I learned in the mercenary career, although this is quite risky, maybe there is a trap over there, but it is better than waiting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a minute!" Lev reached out to stop Behan’s move. "We must take a closer look..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the neat iron boots coming out of the window interrupted the conversation of five people. Everyone’s eyes were cast on the stairs of the stairs, just to see a whole team of fully armed patrols from the street. Going through, all the soldiers were holding the spears and taking the same steps, and the pedestrians and vendors on the streets made way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
