			<div id="content">Although the light in this space is dark, it is not so clear. This Necromancer suddenly popped out of this darkness, just as this darkness itself condensed into this black body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body wrapped in a black robe took a step forward, and Czecho took a step back. The face under the black hood can be seen clearly, though It is a human face, but even under this dark environment can not cover a layer of black gas flowing on the skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Zombie Mage!!!" The red nose suddenly felt a coolness behind her, but now there are no companions around. I really don't understand why the zombie mage found himself. It is impossible for him to be the opponent of such a terrible enemy. They can actually deal with themselves with only one ghost master...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All the calls of Czechoslovakia are in vain. The power of Pluto overwhelm everything, blocking all communication with other dimensions. No Warcraft can help him - although he can't cope with this zombie mage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red nose boss retreats with the advance of the zombie mage, and his hand grips his weapon tightly, although he himself knows that it cannot be protected by weapons. my own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wolf stopped moving forward, and he extended a hand forward and spoke in a slow and low voice: "Babe, come to Dad!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if a beating is in front of the eyes or the ground is splitting under the feet, it will not make the red nose boss even more fearful. He turned and looked behind him. little girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No!" The little girl still clung to the clothes of Czechoslovakia. Although her tone was firm, the red nose could be seen on her expression. There is a bit of spoiled meaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the road becomes spacious, the debris at the foot is getting more and more Many, when I saw a lot of strange armor on the boat, the Necromancer actually piled these things in this passage. It was just fine at the beginning. Now it is almost plugging the road. It is not so much a passage as it is here. A grocery pile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No information was sent behind him, and the Necromancer probably did not chase this road. In this passage full of armor, shackles, scattered weapons, and all sorts of weird things, Kim walked a long way and walked a long way. There was an intersection in front - one step up, one step down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Other people don't know where to go! Everyone should be fine..." Kim himself deceived himself and comforted himself while walking up the stairs. The choice has not been considered by the brain at all, but the instinct feels better to go up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of a bright space, unconsciously, the magician saw that he had come to a new space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a hemispherical hall. The passage chosen by the magician is actually a vent of the height of the hall (this fully proves that this temple is human Built, the necromancer will not consider the problem of ventilation). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician slammed on the ground with his fastest speed, because he looked at the first sight of the hall to see what he didn't want to see at the first sight-- There is a group of necromancers in the hall. Although the magician collapsed, if he had the heart to find it, Kim could not escape the sight of the Necromancer. Fortunately, just as Kim did not intend to meet a group of undead wizards here, the Necromancer did not expect a human magician to pop up here. In fact, they did not know that a group of humans invaded the temple, so they have been Busy with your own business. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician raised half of his head in the vent, and the position of the vent was very high. In this place, the magician could see the situation in the hall. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most conspicuous thing in the hall is a building with a particularly high level of water (especially without vents), but flowing inside the pool. It is not water, but a dark red viscous liquid. It is filled with the thick smell of the air that is emitted from this blood pool. The new blood is constantly being injected from a hole in the center of the top of the hall. The blood column first falls into a vessel at the highest point of the blood pool, then overflows from it, flows into the highest layer, and then the knot It ran down, and the Necromancer commanded cockroaches and took blood from the last level of the blood pool—perhaps this is human blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are they doing?" The magician felt incredibly incredible. Why did the Necromancer smear the blood on the body? But he soon discovered the horrific changes on the bodies. After the red blood was applied, it quickly disappeared. Just as the roots absorbed water, the blood was being absorbed by the dead body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician stared at this horrible scene, isn’t the magic used by the Necromancer? But this thought was quickly vetoed, because these necromancers (both black robes from the top, can't tell what level they are) are not like using magic, they seem to be commanding there. The soldiers are as if they are waiting for something. There is no obvious magical presence in this hall. I don't understand why this is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A corpse suddenly moved, just under the gaze of the magician, this dead person - if there is a living person in the hand of the Necromancer The words are strange things - move up, then stand up and stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are making squadrons! (The squad is actually the result of the decay of the corpse warrior.) No, it is impossible. The magician saw the process of making the squadron by the ghost sorcer they destroyed. It is obviously a very common magic for the necromancer. There is no need to do such a big deal. If this is to create a squadron, then the necromancer is too ignorant of the word efficiency. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A necromancer ushered in, guiding the newly-moving corpse to an exit, and the sergeant immediately pulled a new corpse from the outside to fill this vacancy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden staring at the moving body, he found the difference between this body and the sergeant. He walked like a soldier. It’s a slow pace, but it’s very healthy. It’s not a sergeant. Absolutely not. What is it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold simply forgets his current dangerous situation (but because there is no undead to think of a human being hiding in the dark to observe them, he is actually not very good now) Dangerous), the whole process can't see a little magical look, but this is obviously a magical ritual. Can it be said that these blood flows are treated magically? The magician began to carefully observe the whole process. Is it that the joint uses a magic that he does not know? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician’s eyes finally stopped at the cup-shaped vessel placed at the highest point of the blood pool. This thing is obviously not a component of the blood pool. It was added separately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This thing is...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood above the ceiling does not maintain a constant flow, but A wave of waves, gold saw the whole picture of the cup in the gap between the two waves. This thing evokes his memories. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gold, what are you looking at?" The old magician from the room At the entrance, I came in and asked myself a young apprentice who was reading a thick book. But he did not wait until the apprentice answered and recognized the book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, the classics of magical items? Gold, your power magic is really not good, you want to create a magic similar to that included in this book. The item is still far away... Yes, I remember that you are not interested in the magic of power!” The old magician was very relaxed about the apprenticeship. He never forced Kim to work hard to learn what he didn’t like. However, if Kim is interested, he can get answers to all the questions from the teacher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher!" Kim looked up. "I am reading about the artifact!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Artifacts?! Right! Artifacts, unfortunately those unique treasures have been lost in the stupid wars of mankind. If there were no boring wars of power struggle in the past... Ah, the topic is far away, hey, old, I like it, it’s really a long time! I thought that when I was young, I hated the old man..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher, me There is a question I want to ask you!" Kim stood up and interrupted the old wizard who would surely continue the long classics - similarly he has listened to countless times, though. Ke is a powerful magician and a good instructor, but there are some problems that no one has escaped from. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher, I have a problem! The introduction of human magical items in this book is very detailed, but the introduction of artifacts is rare, except for drawings. With the name and a small amount of instructions, nothing is there!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The artifacts will also oppose each other?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The gods have a tacit understanding of maintaining a balance of power, and the two gods who oppose each other in order to maintain balance, if one creates An artifact, the other side will also create an artifact! Just like this!" The old magician turned the book on the golden hand a few pages and pointed to a cup-shaped figure. "This is the dark holy grail made by Pluto. Also known as the Holy Grail of Blood, this artifact appears because the goddess of life created the "Guardian's Gown"!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Artifact of Pluto, that can only be given Is the Necromancer used?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It seems like this, this artifact was originally the highest treasure of the Necromancer, but after they were expelled by humans, this artifact was Changed to human custody, like most artifacts mastered by humans, the Dark Grail did not know where to go in the final dynasty war! It is a pity that the power of this artifact can only be used by the Necromancer! But since the "Guardian Robe" is still Exist, then this The Holy Grail must still exist in which corner! Gold, look more, maybe you have a chance to see these artifacts on your own!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the Holy Grail of Blood. There is no doubt that its appearance is exactly the same as that painted on the book, engraved with the incomprehensible symbols of the cup body (maybe Text), it is a golden but a layer of black gas, and everything is on the top of the pair of pictures in the depths of memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now Kim can be sure that everything you just saw must have a special meaning. Since the Necromancer has retrieved their own artifacts, it will definitely give the artifact Use it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A commotion occurred among the Necromancers, but this was not because of the unwelcome guests, but because of joy. A new corpse rolled over and sat up, but it was not as sensible as the one just before, and it stood up and began to look around everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where is this?" The resurrected body suddenly spoke, and even the heart of the magician hiding on it almost jumped out of the chest. "Who am I? Why am I here..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after waiting for it to finish, a necromancer walked up, he was from his black Raise a hand under the robes - the gold at the height clearly sees that there is only the bones of the hand, like the sergeant, the only difference is that there is a layer of flowing brilliance above - put the index finger to just resurrected The eyebrows of the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two things that have died but still exist in this world have been watched by humans who can’t understand the communication. After about half a minute, the magician sees the resurrection. The body stood up, and a sergeant immediately took a full body armor - it was the undead sorcerer who was transported by ship, and the adventurer could not judge the armor used. Kim looked at the body and put on the heavy armor that ordinary humans could not afford, and turned into a knight's dress. If you look at it from the outside, it is almost indistinguishable from humans, but the magician knows that this is no longer human. He remembers that there are so many irons in the rough armor that are not worn out, as long as it is There is no way to wear a human with a feeling (not to mention the terrible weight of those armor). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The work of the undead is not fast. Obviously, it is not easy to make such a living zombie. I don’t know how much blood to consume. Let a corpse resurrect (this can also be called a resurrection), at least when the magician is lying on it, he only sees two bodies being taken away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They won’t want to make these living zombies into an army!" Seeing the armored body go out with a necromancer, Kim suddenly thought of the most dead bodies. Possible use. When I think of this monster as an army, the magician feels a horrible fear. He has seen the armor with his own eyes. The steel that is one centimeter thick can resist the attack of all weapons, plus the loss of humanity. Agile, and never tired (the undead certainly does not fatigue), in addition to magic, nothing can pose a threat to such an army. What's even more frightening is that these monsters are not all the tricks of the necromancers. They (at least some of them) have the wisdom to cope with all kinds of sudden changes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bold thought appeared, and Jin suddenly thought that he was in a very favorable position now. Now is a good opportunity. Two necromancers have just resurrected in order to guide them. The two zombies left, there are only two necromancers left, and the undead did not expect a human to hide in the dark, if this time can be unexpectedly started...<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe you should not use wind magic, the magician thinks while walking, you must know that magic also depends on where you use it, and it is difficult to circulate in the air. It is very laborious to use the wind magician in the place, but at the time it was the consequence of the advantages and disadvantages of the gold balance. His opponent is a terrible necromancer. If it is not a blow that is absolutely beyond their expectation, he may not have any chance at all, so he picks the wind magic that is generally not used in a closed space as the first wave. The way of attack, but this will inevitably lead to this dangerous situation now - his magic is almost completely exhausted. The magician only leaves the power of a blasting ball to himself - not so much the last protection as the last suicide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What if my strength is stronger?" The magician thought a little desperately, he could not tell the direction in this maze-like ghost place. The undead will not know where to come from at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you want more powerful power?" A faint sound sounded, and the magician couldn’t hear it until the perception was opened by the dragon elders. This voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who? Who? Where?" The magician who had already reached the top of his nerves looked at him in all directions, but he found nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you want more powerful power?" The voice repeats again, this time you can tell the source of the sound, the magician is scared, he likes The electric shock retracted his hand, and the dark holy grail fell from the hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This thing is talking, the Holy Grail is talking to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can give you strength, give you the power that you can't imagine! The most powerful power humans can achieve!" The Holy Grail begins with one An irresistible way to seduce this eager human being. "With my help, you can become a powerful magician in a blink of an eye, let everyone fall to your feet because of the strength of fear!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "How do you do it?" When unconsciously, gold was swayed by the dark holy cup, and although he had always been disgusted with the power of Pluto. He re-started the Holy Grail from the ground, so that the voice of the Holy Grail can be heard more clearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A force penetrates into the mind of the magician through the hand that touches the Holy Grail. In an instant, he knows a lot of things, the kind of evil ritual, that The whole process of transforming a living human being into a necromancer. The Holy Grail made all kinds of promises to him, telling him how much power he can gain in the process of this transformation, and how many weaknesses can be eliminated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“No! No!” The last point of reason is to resist the effort. “Don’t do this, you will become a necromancer and become an enemy of mankind! Think of the father Think about your mother, think about your brothers and sisters, think about your friends, how can you be sad if you become a necromancer! Even if you gain strength, it is the power of darkness and evil, that is the object you have been fighting!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As long as there is enough power, do you know how much respect and fear you can get? Think about the jealous eyes of others and think about what everyone has to show. Dear look!" The Holy Grail feels that this human will is quite powerful and it begins to exert further influence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician clearly saw how he himself called out on the ground and did not lose to the stone tower building as a place to study magic; clear Seeing how you are in your hometown, even the most magical and most offensive parents welcome him like a welcome hero; clearly see how easy it is to eliminate those half-orcs and Warcraft and the admiration of this companion. Eyes; clearly see how he traveled around the world, leaving all kinds of legends; clearly seeing how he and Wei jointly handed a fatal blow to the damn sage...<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The phantom of the Holy Grail disappeared, and the last hope of the magician was beyond his ability. He could only give the magician a possible illusion, but it is impossible to destroy the Eight-Eyed Devil. The Holy Grail could not create an impossible scene in the phantom. He knew that he could not satisfy this human request, nor could he convince him to become a necromancer. He gave up his efforts and turned into a non-speaking person. Items. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goldenly looked at the Holy Grail in the hand, the illusion of this scene was so real that he could hardly recognize the reality. He looked at the dark passages and ceilings that would never change, wondering if he was too tired before, so that he fell asleep and had a dream while walking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a voice coming from the turn, as if something had come, the magician suddenly found himself in a very dangerous position. This passage was too long. The enemy would find him after bypassing the turn – then he would Can't escape. The magician is determined to take a risk. He infers that the number of enemies from the sound is not very large, probably solved by a detonation ball. So he stood against the wall and stood at the turn, lifting the Holy Grail, and intending to consume magic without the first enemy (the sound is so loud, must be a sergeant). <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; ※※※ <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; magician stood there for about three minutes began to regret it, Because the enemy is obviously not as close as he thinks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably because of the echo in the empty passage, the magician found that the distance between him and the enemies that came over was quite far, far It will allow him enough time to escape, but now everything is late, the magician only waits here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the enemy approaches, the sound can be heard more clearly. The magician discovered at this moment that it should not be a sergeant because of the moving bones. It’s a slap in the air, and now the sound of the metal’s collision is hard to imagine a sergeant walking in armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s those zombies!" Kim made this judgment. The holy grail in the hand will not have any effect on the armor on the body of this terrible enemy (but it should not be a problem to break the squadron). In fact, almost all weapons can't cause anything to that thick armor. Threat. The magician's flustered, with his insignificant magic, he can't deal with these horrible guys. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician’s brain is working desperately, trying to find a way to deal with these horrible warriors. No matter from which point of view, Kim is not planning to be a member of the Undead Legion, or to accompany those victims of the Wraith Tower. The magician finally decided to use one of the most adventurous methods. He had to sneak into the arms of the Dark Knight and then sent the blasting ball directly into his armor (although it was inevitable that he would be injured in doing so). The magician keeps the magic in a state of unpreparedness, preparing for the coming battle of his most dangerous (killed by the half-orcs and only dead, at least not into the undead). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure flashed from the corner, as gold judged, and there was only one, the magician put the holy grail in his hand over his head, then swooped Above, I hope that before the enemy does not respond, I will put him in the body and send the blast ball into his body from the gap of the armor. The destruction of the blast ball in the closed armor is enough to completely destroy the body of the zombie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But things are not so easy, the unrestrained responsiveness and speed of action exceed the expectations of the magician. First, the left hand is used to block the Holy Grail, then It was the right fist slamming, and the magician’s action was like sending the body to the fist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fist is solidly hit on the body of the unlucky magician, falling near the wound, the impact caused by the fist plus the pain of the wound to the magician After two steps back, the whole person was lying on the ground. When the eyes were black, he didn’t know anything. The explosive ball that didn’t have the chance to use disappeared before it worked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gold, Gold!" The voice came from the other side of the distant darkness Let the magician's consciousness begin to gradually recover, and begin to remember what happened. A drop of water dripping from the damp rock wall fell just right on the magician's face, and the cold water droplets accelerated his return to consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where am I?" The magician rolled over and sat up, his brain immediately remembering what had happened before he passed out. Because the eyes can't adapt to the darkness around, they can't see anything for the time being. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's over!" Kim remembered that he was defeated by the undead, and now he is dead - never heard that the undead will leave prisoners. But now I feel that I am still a member of the Undead Legion. This is the ending that the magician doesn't want most! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I won't help you! Even if I am the same kind of you! I will never help the undead to deal with humans!" Unmistakable words blurted out, The magician realized that there was something wrong, because when he spoke, Kim heard the voice of Lev. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a short silence, it was a laugh that made the magician even more embarrassed. All the people, including Wei, couldn’t help but laugh. The magician was not resurrected in the hall by the blood flowing from the Holy Grail, but in a cold, damp cave, lying on a stone, surrounded by his companions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Lev’s laughing and explaining, the magician realized what happened when he passed out. He was ambushed and was attacked by Wei. The warrior did not recognize his companion at once, and he stumbled the magician with a fist. Then Wei had to carry a heavy magician forward (fortunately, Wei's physical strength is really good). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where are we now?" The magician remembered a more realistic question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the cave below the temple!" Behan answered, "It seems that the Necromancer not only transformed the temple, but also expanded a lot of space under the temple, here It should be a natural tunnel connected to the temple. I really don’t understand the necromancers. The number of them is so few. What should I do in such a large space? However, we should be safe here, and the necromancer wants to find us. I'm afraid I have to spend a little time!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about other people?" The magician only noticed that there were only four people around him, babe and red nose bosses. not here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know, but rest assured, I remember that Babe and Czech are together. With Babe's ability, they should not encounter any problems? To be honest, we can come across a miracle. I didn't think that the passages were connected!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, Kim, what is this?" Behan raised the dark holy grail and shook it in front of the magician. "Where did you find it, it looks like a cup used on the sacrifice?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the Holy Grail of the Dark!!!!!!" Everyone looked at the cup with unbelievable eyes, could not imagine This thing, it doesn't look like a special cup is actually an artifact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is this thing used?" Lev asked with hope, since it is an artifact, it must have a very powerful force, perhaps for the current adventurers. Said that the power of this thing can be used. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know, but as far as I know, the power of this thing can only be used by the undead, and living creatures have no way to use it!" The smashed hope of the thief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a very slight vibration coming from the rock wall of the cave. It seems that something is coming, and it is a heavier thing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go!" No more, the group immediately moved in the other direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly along the way, nothing happened, and even the adventurous of the peace began to be a bit strange. Undoubtedly, the Necromancer should know that a group of humans have entered the temple, but they have no movements, which makes people more fearful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adventurers are now clearly the main channel, which can be distinguished from the scale of the channel. The underground part of the Pluto Temple is obviously not finished yet, and the rooms are not decorated. The scattered stones can often be seen on the open space. I really don't know what to do with the population of the Necromancer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is very nervous, no one knows what the Necromancer is doing, although he wants to leave this passage, but if the Necromancer is really preparing for a trap, Then they must be prepared at every important crossing, so everyone is still following the road. After all, there is still room for manoeuvre in the large space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, to everyone’s surprise, there are a lot of good ambush spots along the way, but the necromancers are not there, they don’t seem to be Inside the Temple of Pluto, but in an ordinary ancient ruin. Everywhere is empty, every cautious reconnaissance can only see the air. It felt like the Necromancer had already withdrawn from the place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The small passage has to turn a lot of bends, but the adventurers are now on the opposite of this main passage but there are not many corners, although there are also many intersections . In an atmosphere full of doubts, uneasiness and tension, everyone did not know how many roads they had gone until fresh air came with the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone passed a crossroads. Like the other intersections, there was no unwelcome thing when they passed, but after everyone passed, the dense voice suddenly came out. Everyone turned their bodies and saw countless bones wielding weapons coming out of the road and swooping at them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone is running!" Behan yelled and smashed the sword of the earth into the earth, and the rushing squadron was hit by the force that rushed out from the ground. A number of squadrons have become broken bones, but this level of attack is unable to withstand the undead undead. Everyone saw that the black robes worn by the necromancers appeared in the squadrons. They completely lost the possibility of turning back, only to move forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outside is the night, but it is still clear that this is an exit, the magician first ran out, but he was right at the door - one side The hall with the door stopped, the adventurer's prediction was correct, and the three unidentified soldiers who had been waiting here could be seen at the three entrances. They are completely surrounded, and the number is so much that Kim understands that they have no possibility of breaking through. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two sorcerers at the door are enjoying the desperate expression on the human face. It’s just to watch this expression for a while. The horse ordered the attack. But they forgot what humans would do in despair, and the "blood war in the city" in the Undead War was the best proof. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; ※※※ <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "I ...... in the dark in the distance, calling the wizard of light come . . . All powerful powers are in the hands of the gods in charge of them... with your great power, smash all the darkness of the world... Thunderbolt opens!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The magician read his most powerful mantra, and he has no intention of controlling this curse. He would rather die without a whole body or become a necromancer. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; ※※※ <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; souls who, although surrounded, but did not attack, as cats are always the same If you want to play with enough to start with the mouse, the Necromancer does not want to kill these humans immediately, but they want to enjoy the taste of horror first. You must know that these human beings have destroyed one of their companions. This sin must be good for human beings. Compensation. But this gap allows their enemies to make the final, desperate struggle. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "? everyone ready" in the process of self-rapid expansion of Jinzhou, the magician said loudly to his companion. I don't know if this is lucky. In the days with Old Locke, Kim has completely remembered this curse - even though he knows that there is no way to fully control it. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "! Kim, are you okay we go, you alone ......" <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; " Nothing, no matter what, I am a magician, I have a way!" The magician barely squeezed out a smile. This method was thought of after he showed the curse. Although he was stubborn, he could The first process of binding (the first process is the fall of the thunder, the second process is the entire lightning ball falling) to achieve limited control of the curse, so that the power of lightning for the companions to break open. The flaw in this plan is that when controlling the curse, the magician must go all out, that is, completely lose the power of defense and action (although his magic does not have much left), do not know when it will die. In the hands of the undead. However, in this case, who can consider so much? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Necromancer feels that it is not right. In the sky above the temple, huge energy is gathering rapidly. This is not a thunderstorm of natural phenomena, but some kind of power interference. result. When the Necromancer finally confirmed what was going on, the huge sphere of lightning energy gathered in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is a curse! Damn, these humans actually used the curse!" The electrocardiogram was quickly spread among the necromancers (some of the necromancers from the light The age of the dynasty existed. Every necromancer knows the horror of the curse and knows what the result of this indiscriminate destructive power can be. The turmoil immediately came into being, and both the Master and the Ghost Master knew that they did not have the ability to confront this devastating force. Some of the Necromancers were ready to use the momentary movement, but these space magic is now useless because of the power of the furious elves in the atmosphere. Magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the atmosphere over Undead Island is very powerful, because Thunderbolt quickly gathers power at an unprecedented speed, when the Necromancer determines the curse, the Thunder The ball has already taken shape, and in a few minutes, the lightning ball can grow to the point where it can project the ruined thunder, which is also the time for the adventurers to break through. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where to go from where to go, everything is back to the initial point of power, with the name of the sacred name of the Pluto, the power is gathered in my body of dust! The Great Underworld!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The space opened his mouth and swallowed the thunderbolt energy ball that was still expanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark clouds created by the power of magic are spreading faster than they are, and before the adventurers react, the stars are already visible in the sky. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s over, it’s really over!" Although it didn't say it, the look of despair appeared on everyone's face, and the user of the spell appeared in the adventurer. In front of him - all the undead have given way to the body of this black robe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black robes don’t hesitate to go to the adventurer, the re-emergence of the moon shines, letting everyone see the unseen black on the human face gas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disregarding the nervousness of the adventurers, the zombie mage came to the front of everyone, this is an extreme contrast, one of the five people is all arrogant and tense, the other side is There is no expression of fighting, and it seems that he has the confidence to destroy this group of human beings at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black robe bent over and bowed to the human race in a very beautiful posture. "Welcome to the undead island, my name is Wolf." Thank you very much for bringing back the little girl Beibei. Please give thanks to a father! Maybe there are some misunderstandings between us, but I believe this is very easy to eliminate!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone, please!" Wolf held up the glass inside the hand, which was full of seductive fragrance. Amber-glossy liquids, these signs are more indicative of the age of the wine in their cups than wrinkles indicate the age of the person. Although the legendary Necromancer had no need to eat at all, Wolff violated this legend, and he drank the wine from his cup in a very chic position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although suspicious, there is no reason for the guests to reject this polite invitation. Everyone follows the spirit of the necromancer and drank the wine in his hand. I must admit that this wine is really delicious, but for the six people now, the good wine is also tasteless. They have not recovered from the shock of sitting in the guest who suddenly became a necromancer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are now in a hall full of candles, sitting in front of a table that aristocrats can enjoy. Wolf sat on the head, six guests were on either side, and Babe was sitting next to her father. There was also a cup in front of her, but it was obviously juice. It turned out to be a very lively babe in the father - this point has been repeatedly identified, Babe really long and this is called Wufu's necromancer is five or six points - next to the rather restrictive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The change is too fast, it is simply unacceptable, and the enemy who was just alive and dead suddenly became a hospitable master. This is ironic, as if they came This horrible undead island is a visitor rather than an adventure. But in any case, they have already made a circle at the door of the ghost gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one master of Wolf (the Necromancer) in the hall. The food placed in front of the guests is rich and beautiful. I really don’t understand why the Necromancer is preparing so much. The food, do they know that these adventurers are coming early. For all sorts of concerns, although everyone is hungry, no one is moving these foods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wolf saw the thoughts of the guests. He smiled slightly and cut a large rib of bones into his mouth. The undead sorcerer's relishing chews are really no different from a human being when enjoying a good meal. I really can't see that he is actually an undead soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wof...Mr...." Kim has been unable to endure this superficial atmosphere. If you want to do it, you should get better soon, without knowing this. Before the real purpose of the Necromancer, all the guest sets were actually a kind of torture for people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The zombie mage blocked the words of gold with a gesture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be excited! Kim - you don't object to me, so call you! - I know what you are going to say! You must ask, why do I want to This entertains you, and what is the relationship between me and Beibei!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"About the former, although I am a necromancer, I don't hate humans. Although other necromancers may not think so, I don't think there is any fundamental difference between the necromancer and human beings. In fact, all the necromancers. They are all humans - at least they were humans..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So you built those hundred grievance towers? And every year you go to the mainland to seek new The body? It seems that this is exactly what you said!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be excited, young magician! Although I am the highest on this undead island One of the necromancers, but not everything is my decision! I can shelter you, but I can't change the customs that have been left for many years! No one in this world can make everything as you like. In this respect, the power of habit is very powerful, just like humans!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician sat down, Wolf's words are very polite Compared with him, he shows himself Very excited. Just like Wolf said, except for him, other necromancers don't "like" humans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "On the second question, I am indeed the father of Babe, don't doubt, Babe is indeed my daughter, and indeed a human!" The husband deliberately missed the first question and did not finish it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But, I heard that the Necromancer has no ability to give birth!" Elna spoke, to be honest, she did not have any grasp when she said this. Seeing that the undead wizards who didn’t have to eat and drink actually ate and drank in front of them (?), I really couldn’t tell if they had the ability to give birth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Really, you are not wrong!" Wolf answered, and he noticed that Babe was watching himself nervously. "The Necromancer is really infertile. I was a necromancer seven years ago! Babe is the daughter I was born when I was human!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" What do you want to do?" Wei couldn't help but ask questions. He directly cut the topic into the issue that everyone cares about most. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I just do my best to build more hatred between humans and undead wizards! Hatred can only produce blood, blood will produce more hatred! I just want to free the two races from this infinite loop!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Everyone is stunned. I really can't think of the words of the necromancer's mouth, so that the undead and human beings can peacefully coexist. This is simply impossible. The hatred accumulated by humans and the necromancers can not be offset by offsetting. To be honest, the two races can coexist now because they do not have enough power to destroy each other. If you have the opportunity, no matter whether it is a human being or a necromancer, you will not hesitate to completely ruin each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as everyone was still relishing the words of Wolf, the Necromancer suddenly burst into laughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ha ha ha...haha..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14 eyes are aligned at the same time Laughing at the dead wizard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha...haha...I really laughed at me, I didn’t think that my mouth could say such awkward words!...hahaha... I really didn't think that I could one day put this kind of words on my lips... haha..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adventurers look with restless eyes Wolf, who was laughing and leaning back, no one knows what this sorcerer means. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Babe, go back to sleep!" After finally stopping the laughter, Wolf said to Babe in an indescribable tone, although the little girl looks very Unwilling, but she still obeyed, she went out from a small door in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You, I am really sorry, it seems that this is not suitable for me! I am not so great, I am not full of ambitions, but also There is no such lofty ambition! I have never taken any great goals as my responsibility. For me, the only thing that is really important in this world is my daughter Babe!” The Necromancer speaks in a soft tone, “And me. My wife, Kira!" But this sentence is too light, and anyone who is light can't hear it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wolf raises his voice, "All I do is for my daughter! I just don't want her to carry a heavy father of a necromancer." Shadow!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do I have room for choice?" Wolf turned his face to face Behan. There was a burst of angry flame in his eyes, but the flame just passed away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you believe in fate?" Wolf suddenly turned around. "You believe that there is a power in the world called fate, no matter what, It was decided at the beginning, no matter how you struggle, you can't break free!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no fate in the world!" The magician replied loudly, " Everything has its causes, and there are reasons for it. If you put enough effort, everything can be achieved! If the goal is not achieved, it means that your efforts are not enough, or you have made The thing that goes against your goal!" This sentence does not know how many times he said to him. Every time the gold is in depression, the old magician uses this sentence to encourage him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe! I have thought about it the same way as you did until I saw the traces of fate! Do you believe it? One day something happened, for a moment The goal of your past efforts has been completely changed, and just after that moment, you will know what you will do in your life!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..."< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Young, what is your current ideal? Do you want to be the most powerful magician, master all the magic of magic? I tell a story to You listen, there used to be a magician. He has been obsessed with magic since he was very young. He studies hard and tirelessly pursues the true meaning of magic! He thinks that the happiest thing in life is to learn and study magic! He is in light and darkness. There is amazing talent in magic. Soon, the teacher can't teach him more things, so he started to work hard to pursue the mystery of magic!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Wafton continued to say a word. "But one day, he met a girl. Everything that he has been pursuing in the past has disappeared at that moment! From the first glance, the magician knows that she is the highest pursuit of her life! It was a little weird, but at that time he completely left the magic behind him! Even if the highest level of magic is put together with the girl to choose, he will not hesitate to choose her, and this magician never regrets. This decision has never been!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone listened quietly, obviously, Wolf is talking about his own story, but no one can hear this. What does it have to do with Wolfe's choice to be a Necromancer? On the contrary, if a person has a happy family, he would never think of becoming a necromancer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although her family opposed the two of them, at that time, any objection did not help, and finally he took her with her own magic. Elopement...and then come to a place where they can live quietly, then they have a daughter!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But fate does not bring all happiness When he was handed over to a person, his wife suddenly became ill and was the kind of treatment therapist refused to treat!” Wolff turned his eyes to Elna. “Do you know?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes! In order to maintain the balance between life and death, the goddess of life is not allowed to treat those mortal diseases! The therapist can treat infectious diseases such as wounded and plague, but can not be treated The disease that is decayed by the inside, this is against the goddess!" Elna did not hesitate to meet the necromancer's sight, although very pitiful, but this is not the fault of the therapist, nor the goddess' fault, after all, God Can't take care of every mortal, even God, there are rules he must follow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Necromancer turned his eyes, although he had hated the therapist for this time, but after calming down, it was not the fault of anyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His wife has left him forever, although he is very sad, but after all he still has a daughter, he is not desperate, he does his best while Burden the responsibility of the father and mother until one day, he found that he also had the same illness as his wife!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His daughter is still very small, no Ways to take care of himself, and because of his study of dark magic, people, including other magicians, are far from him. He has no friends who can be truly trusted, can be entrusted, and he has no relatives. His wife’s relatives It is impossible for us to take care of this elopement-born child!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He can't see the crystallization of himself and his wife become orphans - in this cruel world Her fate is imaginable, but he can't find any feasible way. Even if he can find a daughter who promises to take care of his daughter after he dies, he can't believe this guarantee! Just in this desperation. In, he got an opportunity, A chance to let him continue to exist, he can continue to exist, can take care of his daughter "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;! & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;</div>
