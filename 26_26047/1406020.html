			<div id="content">The speed of Retreat's revenge was very fast. Just the third day after the mercenaries rested and swept the enemy, the eyes of the sky gave them news of the enemy's army. The enemy soldiers were divided into eight roads and wrapped in all directions, and it was obvious that they had been ambushed. They lost not only the escort army, but also the supply of the frontline army for three months. Although the frontline hoarding materials are still sufficient, the loss is enough for all the commanders to jump. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But everything is beyond the eyes of the sky, the range of the halfling and his eagle reconnaissance is too wide, only two or three hours, he You can patrol the entire area once, and the movement of the army is absolutely impossible to hide. The mercenaries got the news for the first time, and immediately began to act, effortlessly forming the encirclement before the formation of the encirclement - even before it was launched - and with the full spoils on the way back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time they are doing beautifully! In less than a month, five wins in five wars, annihilated more than three times the number of their own enemies, and intercepted a large amount of military supplies. In fact, if this situation is re-enacted three or four times, the army of the Leite Empire stationed in the new territory may be disintegrated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole army is full of laughter and laughter, everyone knows that this time will receive a lot of rewards. Because according to unwritten practices, for special reasons, the wealth seized by the mercenaries is owned by them and not given to their employers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jin silently sat in the carriage and closed his eyes without saying a word. Perhaps it is a sense of repulsion. Other magicians and he don't talk much about each other. The relationship between them is only to maintain a basic respect and not interfere with each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold adds a defensive magic to himself. From that night on, he tried to keep himself in a protective spell and let himself get used to this state. Now the lack of magic is more obvious, and it can't be felt for a while, but it becomes more and more obvious with the extension of time. Because the speed of his magic recovery can't keep up with the speed of consumption. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the defensive ring that the teacher gave him is still there, there is a permanent, perhaps semi-permanent, advanced defensive magic, and only one Thoughts can be launched. It was a pity that in order to defend against the attack of the sage, that is, the Eight-Eyed Devil, this ring consumed power and was destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These days Kim has been thinking about the battle with Liz - if this can be called fighting. He now determines that as long as the enemy is close to a certain distance without defense, he will definitely be finished, even if he observes hostility through his eyes like Nubis said, it is difficult to resist similar emergencies. The time it takes to detect a bad spell to complete a spell is too long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The solution is to stay in the state of releasing magic or simply keep a defensive magic on your body! It's simple to say, but it's not so easy to do. His magic can't load the powerful spell, but the weak defense spell doesn't have much use. This kind of problem is really too nerve-racking, and it seems that there is no good way to solve it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is a teacher, how will he solve it? Teacher...Yes...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold suddenly remembered one thing! A thing that was almost ignored by him: his teacher, the speed of the spell of the great magician Xiu Ke. How to say it, in the actual training between the men and women in the stone tower, the teacher's magic always gives him the feeling of completing in a moment, it seems that there is no need to use the necessary steps of magic! If magic can reach that speed, then things will be solved and the crisis can be attacked immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is the teacher doing it? How can we increase the speed to that level? He didn't ask this kind of question, but the old magician always responded to him with the words "work slowly, you can naturally reach this speed." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of the teacher, Kim immediately remembered the elf magic he saw that day! So the wide range of fog is actually made by a young semi-fairy, really unimaginable! If human magic is used to create the same effect, only the power of the great magician can be achieved! I really want to know how it is done...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold feels upset for a while, many thoughts are moving together in the mind, and the brain is confused. This kind of problem depends on himself to think that he can't think of a complete answer. He decided to put it down temporarily and not think about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician is indeed the most cared for in the army, enjoying various privileges. For example, people have always taken care of their lives. When the gold came down from the carriage, his tent was set up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is coming again, covering the whole world with a black curtain. Soon, the entire camp fell into a quiet, except that the bonfire that had not been completely extinguished still glowed a little red, and everything seemed to have fallen asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the shadow of the man outside was projected onto the tent, Kim Jong-soo blinked. The magician felt abnormal, so he climbed up, went out, and saw the half-fairy girl who was scorning the sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sword gold recognizes that it is their thing, Wei’s spoils of life and death. This magic sword does not agree with any of them, so Leif wants to sell it many times, but they all give up because there is no reasonable price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician looked at the female soldier in front of him and said nothing, he felt that the bruise on his eyes began to linger, but there was another impulse in his heart. Brewing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you doing?" Kim thought so bluntly, but did not say it. Another idea is now full of his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Behan brother wants me to apologize to you! So I apologize!" Lisi said without hesitation, then he noticed that the magician’s eyes were concentrated. On the fine sword in her hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold looks forward, then he notices the other person’s movements, he is surprised to see this incredible scene, his eyes are falling out: Lisi Actually, I was calmly stroking the sword of the sword. This sword gold touched, except that the hilt can be touched, other parts will immediately enjoy the taste of electric shock, and because of this, Lev has always used fabric to wrap it all tightly. ,just in case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your hand..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hahahaha..." Liss looked at Kim The expression finally laughed out. It seemed that the magician’s expression and face were very funny. "You said this child! It was just bought from your thief companion hand! It was shocked, so I have to comfort myself..." She said, she lifted the sword and put the sword on her cheek. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole sword began to glow, emitting a blue light, and the face of the half-predator girl was clearly seen on this dark night of the moon, let that Longer ears than humans are particularly noticeable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This sword is very rare! The perfect combination of magic and metal! This sword has its own consciousness, it has a very clear consciousness, than Behan Brother's sword of the earth is also excellent! But it is still very timid and frightened. Anyone who owns it wants to force it with violence, but this can only make it hurt more deeply, and the sense of resistance is stronger." Lisi The face leaves the blade, and the light dims and then disappears. "But it is a very gentle child. As long as you talk to it and comfort it, it will be very willing to help you soon!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, girl waving The sword played a few swords. The blue shards in the air interweave a huge flower and then disappear in the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, I apologize! Goodbye, I hope that you will not send your boring compassion next time! If you have extra pity, you will have pity and mercy." Let yourself! If you look at the enemy and rush to your side, will you see that you are poor and will not give you a sword!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a minute!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lisi turned and looked at the gold in front of him. The magician was looking at her face and seemed to be embarrassed to say something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You...I mean...you ... can you teach me the elf magic!" The golden drums have all the courage to open this request to the girl who is younger than himself to make him feel very embarrassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician lowered his head and did not dare to look at the slightly surprised girl in front of him. After a short and embarrassing silence, the semi-fairy girl finally answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why are you pursuing this power?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are already strong now! In terms of magic, the strength of this age like you is already very good! Magic is a step-by-step road... you will continue to exercise your magic skills, sooner or later. Can reach the height you want to achieve!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..." Kim said it was unclear, indeed, as far as his magic is concerned, he is among his peers. It's very strong, but on the adventure, he learned too many spells, and most of them are powerful spells. With his current level of magic, this spell can't be used at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But that's too slow!" The magician looked up hard, Try to suppress the urge to turn around and escape. It’s really wonderful. I’m actually asking a woman who is not well-known and younger than herself to ask for magic. Kim feels that his face is hot like a fire. But the temptation to gain powerful magic in a short time temporarily overthrew everything else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician’s answer makes the girl giggling, and Kim suddenly finds that this half-fair is really smiling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't think this is your real answer!" The girl stopped laughing and looked at Kim with a smile. "What do you want to pursue? What do you want to get this power? If you don't understand yourself, then what power does not make sense to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Lisi's figure disappeared into the darkness, leaving only the magician standing alone in the hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do I want?" Jin lay quietly, thinking about this sudden problem. The surroundings are now quiet, only the bugs that the little bugs occasionally make. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do I want to get? The adventure is to strengthen the power, but what do you do after you have the power of the big magister level? Kim carefully examined his yu hopes and found that he did not use this power to gain fame and fortune. He does not have a clear outline of the future life, but an attitude of peace of mind. If one day he gains the power of the Magister's level, he may return to his father's little grocery store. While being an ordinary grocery store owner - if his father let him inherited - while doing magical research, I occasionally recalled my wonderful adventure in the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If that's the case, what is the point of becoming a big magician? Maybe you can go back now, when you are a grocery store owner, you can write and count! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I don’t want to go back, I don’t know why, I just don’t want to go back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do I want? What do you want to learn magic? It is clear that everything is clear, but this problem seems to touch a tender part of the deepest part of the heart. The magician's thoughts began to expand, and I began to think about the days when I was a child, then how did I go to the School of Magic in a misunderstanding, then how to learn, graduate, go home, and then continue to study...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why am I so anxious to leave home? Suddenly, I jumped into my mind and thought that I was afraid. Kim suddenly discovered that since he became a magician, he has not stayed at home for a long enough time, as long as he has the opportunity to leave, as if he is escaping something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Escape? It is escaping. For the family in the hometown who regards magic as a beast, if left, then the road to magic will end... But is this the real reason? Or there are other reasons...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold turned over and told him something in his heart, can't continue thinking about it. The chaotic thoughts are mixed with irritability, no clue, and Kim only turns around and fights against the depression that cannot be vented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The righteousness of the demon is just a sneak peek, and it is hard to pull the gold that was originally intended to be unloved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gray sky, countless unknown things twisted in the chaotic sky Move and struggle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician looked down at the ground, the land was desolate, there was no grass, no animals, no trace of green, not even sand, just a yellow, infinite Withered yellow. Just like the half-orc wilderness, it is only the half-orc wilderness that can occasionally see the bare stone on the ground with the earth, but there are no other colors in this place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gold!" A loud greeting, scared the magician a big jump, he turned and saw a smiling face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Beautiful...Mimi..." It’s not the yellow-haired hoe before, and the body of Mimi is a lot taller, but the face is still the same. Or, gold feels nothing has changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You...what are you here!" Meimi stepped forward, and Kim unconsciously stepped back. I haven't seen each other for so many years, and when I watched the other side come close, Kim suddenly felt helpless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can't I come here?" Mimi wore a blue jacket with a light yellow skirt, and the hair was still behind her, so it was easy to mess The horns are combed into two scorpions that hang down to the shoulders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold has taken a step back. He doesn’t know why he is doing this. It seems to be a subconscious effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ha ha ha ha..." Mi Mi laughed, probably feeling that Kim is so embarrassed. "What's the matter with you... Strongman, I won't eat you again..." But this laughter only made Kim feel more at a loss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gold!" A completely different voice came, and then one hand hit the magician's shoulder, he turned his head and saw another The face of a childhood friend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's the matter with you?" Ken asked with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, dear!" Mimi ran over, and did not shun the husband's neck! The magician looked at it, although he knew that there was nothing wrong with it, but it was not a full stomach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is not comfortable? Kim!" Ken is holding his wife with one hand, facing the magician, the smile on his face has not changed, still so brilliant, with The kind-hearted friend looks at the magician with the expression of a close friend. But at this moment, Kim couldn't move his smile to his face. He could only twitch his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What am I doing? Why can't you laugh? Obviously, it was a very happy scene. The other husband and wife were so kind, but they felt depressed and irritable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the most eager, most desired pursuit - but this pursuit is not available. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An answer seems to have rushed up, but there is another powerful force to push it down. Kim is simply afraid to find that he has begun to laugh with the laughter of Ken and Mi Mi, but the laughter is full of things that are definitely not joy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It doesn't matter, I still have magic! A voice shouted in the heart, making the magician laugh louder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咔嚓! The huge sound of the metal breaks the strange magician who was sleeping, and he jumped up from the dream. He found that it was just a dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers outside are dealing with a car that has been inadvertently swamped. The sound of the sound is just the result of someone trying to pick up the wheel with a sword. The sword couldn't hold such a big force and it was finally broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jin reached out and tried to touch his forehead, but he found that his hands were full of dirt. It turned out that when he was dreaming, his fingers grabbed his blanket and stabbed it into the dirt under the blanket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is already bright, and the mercenaries are packing up. Starting today, they are about to enter the area where the Rite army is tightly controlled. It’s not a joke here. Even with the eyes of the sky, this journey is still in jeopardy. They were lightly loaded the first time they passed, but now the difficulty of getting such a rich loot is further enhanced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers were quickly assembled and all unnecessary things were either abandoned or burned. In addition to the things that can be carried around, all the belongings are concentrated and placed on several sturdy carts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, everything is ready. The army began to set off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician sat down on the carriage without bowing his head until it sounded loud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kim looked up and saw a blissful Lev, who rode a horse on the side of the magician's carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leif’s face looks happy and it seems that something is going to happen It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician has not seen this thief in the past few days, because according to his personal strengths, he was assigned to the squad of the reconnaissance, usually away from the main force of the army. At night, it is not a camp with them, but an outside camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong, you look languid, as if you didn't sleep well at night!" Lev clearly noticed that the magician's look was different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No! Nothing!" Kim Instinct touched his face with his hand, because he was hiding in the tent because he was so miserable after being shackled. Go out. However, after three or four days, these bruises have basically recovered, at least not seemingly obvious. This is also thanks to the resilience of Kim itself and several healing spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We can send it!" Lev's face was full of smugness. "Do you know, the lightning sword..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You sold him to Lisi." Gold gave a cold answer, "How much?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Two hundred magic crystal coins!" The thieves immersed in happiness did not find the magician's attitude of being too indifferent. "Two hundred ah... Last time they only wanted to go out of twenty! You see, we left this sword. Very right!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Far away, a greeting came from the front, and Lev responded with a loud voice, then turned to the magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have to go, wait a minute!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the horse disappearing In the field of vision, Kim lowered his head again. It seems that Lev and other people get along very well, maybe everyone else gets along well with these new companions, except him. Kim slightly raised his head, and the magician who was sitting in a carriage with him ignored him. Two are watching the magic book, and the other is closing his eyes like him. These days, there is almost no communication between him and these magicians, except for simple greetings. Or they are peers, they have a clear rejection of the gold. The magic wand with gold on his body illustrates the identity of his great wizard - this is actually the limit of what this age can achieve. Those young people who are almost the same age as Kim but are only trainee magicians have seen the beautiful magic wand more than once. Even if they can't say that they are full of enthusiasm, at least they are full of curiosity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of yourself, you are not good at getting along with other people! Kim looked up again, but he could no longer distinguish any familiar figure from the flow of people. If he didn't get to know Lev, maybe he couldn't touch other people at all. In fact, as he knows, if it weren't for Lev, he couldn't come with the other three. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After thinking of the past, Kim immediately remembered the willingness to remember, the unforgettable memory of the illusion world in Undead Island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ken is dead, instinctively said to him, but there is still a trace of luck in the heart of Kim, after all, this news has not been proved by reality. But in addition to luck, Kim also found himself so lucky for this terrible thing, which made him even start to hate himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician lowered his head down and put the hood of his robes over his head. Can’t you say that it’s to cover too much sunlight or to hide yourself in the shadows? . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What!" Bright is just jumping up, this bad news makes him not I dare to believe in my senses, but this is full of blood, and the magician who is injured by four arrows is brought back. It can't be a lie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire transportation team was completely annihilated, and all supplies and supplies fell to the enemy's hands! This is the twentieth day after he took up this important position, and he immediately made such a big leak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the palace to report this matter to the emperor? No, no! This is simply telling all the colleagues - those who are extremely dissatisfied with his outbreak, and who are waiting for him to be free - he is an incompetent fool! This time, I lost the supply of the entire army for three months on the front line. If the situation is repeated again, even with the relationship of the Sayādaw, Victor will never be able to keep him in such a prominent position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brett’s anxious squatting, then he turned and questioned the wounded in front of him. The latter was eager to report this terrible news, so the wound had not been treated, and the white blood bandage appeared on the spotted blood, making his injury look more serious than the actual one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, grown up! It was foggy at the time, and it was not a few days before leaving the city of Berwick. Everyone had no preparations and no dreams. They actually lie there!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reconnaissance magic? Do you forget the marching regulations?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We used it, adults! But without any discovery, there must be a magician in the enemy. This is not accidental, but a well-prepared ambush. Adults, you know, for this situation, Scouting magic is useless..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright slammed into the chair, things were terrible. The wounded had already told him the whole process: the enemy suddenly attacked and swept the entire transport team with intensive bows and arrows. Almost all the magicians were not spared—these magicians did not go to the cover first, but tried to use the magic immediately, and the result was all hedgehogs without any obscuration. Only he was lucky to escape, and then escaped with a moment of movement in the gap between the two armies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he did not have a result when he left, but this result does not have to guess! Bright is not stupid enough to pin his hopes on the possibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You go to the treatment first!" Brett ordered, the wounded retired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No! This kind of thing can't be hidden, it must be solved before things are exposed! Yes, you must immediately eliminate the damn bugs and take back all the supplies! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This thought made Brett feel great, and he still has a trump card in his hand, that is, he and this terrible sorcerer who came here with him! The enemy should not run far, and immediately mobilize heavy soldiers. It is definitely time to get it. As long as the victory is won, the shadow of failure will be hidden under the aura of victory. No one can say anything to him at that time! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But first of all, we must strengthen the defense in the border areas, so as not to let the group of bugs sneak away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is dark, the blue sky turns black, like Mingyan The transformation of the young girl into a mature young woman is more attractive to the attention of the opposite sex - the mercenaries not only stop to camp and rest as usual, but speed up the march. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The halfling has the ability to see the wild, and the night does not hinder the eyes of the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage was shaking for a while, and the magician above it thought that the car had to be disintegrated. They have completely left the flat road, and they have chosen some remote roads to go. Although I don't know why, Kim vaguely felt that things were not quite right. He feels sore muscles - it's tiring to sit in a car for a day - and these soldiers who are more tired than him are speeding up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other few sitting in the same car are almost unable to hold on, and dealing with books for many years, the physical strength of the magician lacking exercise is generally not good. They are now pale and look bloodless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people are riding horses, but most of them are walking, which means that the mercenaries are saving horsepower so that they can be put into battle at any time. The marching route began to change irregularly, often just left here, and suddenly turned around. The entire army is now exceptionally quiet, and almost no one speaks except the occasional squad of the commander. War horses and carts also seem to be infected by this unusual atmosphere, and they become cautious. In addition to the apron still protesting, the entire army is like a "silent" magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if you are slow, people can now feel that something is not good, this is something that has never happened before. Throughout the night they were moving at high speed in this almost suffocating silence. When the sun of the East shook again and again, Kim felt that he had not seen the dawn for ten years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The order to suspend the advance was suddenly released. Just as a string that had been stretched for too long suddenly slackened, the soldiers who heard the order immediately fell to the ground and gasped. Not only is the road to the night, the repression before this crisis has made everyone feel unusually nervous and exhausted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sudden hoof came, and the magician looked at the sound and met the sight of Behan! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am looking for you! Kim!" Behan saw Jin Daxi, "Come on!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five people are now coming together again, to be exact, six people, because Liz is on the side. They left the big team a little, so they could talk freely without fear of hearing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You must leave!" Behan calmly opened his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong?" Kim also reacted, but in fact, except for him, everyone else probably knows what happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We were surrounded by enemies! They blocked us before we stopped, we spent one night without smashing them! Now we are surrounded!" Behan’s tone is still very calm, it seems that he is just talking about a very ordinary thing. "At noon, we will abandon all the weights and break out to the west."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Being surrounded!" The magician asked in disbelief. Isn't there an eagle knight with a halfling in the sky? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!" Lisi took the mouth. "It’s weird, but now we are really surrounded. From the daytime, the enemy follows us. They seem to know Our march is in the direction, but we have done a good job and got rid of them six times, but I don't know where they came from! Bush said that they seem to be suddenly appearing, but there is no such thing nearby. A place enough to hide so many soldiers...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The situation is really dangerous now! Behan continued to say, "But this battle has nothing to do with you, you better leave as soon as possible!" Now the encirclement is not very strict, gold, as long as you use magic, it should not be a problem to bring a few people to escape. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So what about you..." The magician asked a little stuttering. The matter was so sudden that he had not reacted for a while.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behan reveals a smile, "Reassured, Kim, I will take care of myself!" I have to lead the troops out of the enemies..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is silent, everyone sees from Behan’s smile, it’s not like he said It’s so easy. The magician stares at Behan’s eyes. The man hides his anxiety and fear under his relaxed smile. It’s so hidden, almost invisible, but his eyes betray him. What is said in the eye is screening, a kind of awareness of death.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician’s heart sinks, he doesn’t know much about the military, he doesn’t know The situation in front of him is sinister, but from Behan’s eyes he knows that there is not much hope in this battle. This is why Behan asked them to leave. They are not mercenaries and there is no need to sacrifice for this battle.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly appeared in his mind, the body that was opened by huge weapons, and that heavy weapon would only be used on the battlefield.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a fight! Kim calmed down and said, his tone is now calm, without any hesitation, making people understand that bullying is useless.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... of! "Béhano was surprised to see the change of Kim's attitude, the magician's eyes were aggressive, and he couldn't help but tell the truth.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You ask us to be in your danger Leave you behind? You don't trust us? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leif stretched out the gold cuffs, but Kim ignored him.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Is it not worth trusting? Yes, I admit that the flame magician who fought last time was deliberately put! In order to let the surrounded Leite army take the opportunity to break through... I don't know the war, I don't know how to go into war, and I feel that they are very moved by the heroic battle. When you are all fighting, I become a bystander...but! "The magician added a tone, "I will never leave now, I am not tired, my magic will be useful!" ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician turned back, and the hoofs coming from behind made him unable to turn his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are really an interesting guy!" The horse galloped, flashing past, leaving only the sound of a semi-fairy in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright sat in the battle and watched the movement of the army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sorcerer has gone back! It’s really unbelievable to say that the shackles of the Supreme have such a terrible power that they can transport so many troops in an instant, and they are actually transporting troops at random, which is not subject to general restrictions, even if he The same is true of places that have never been visited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enemy is more awkward than the fox, so changing the direction of the march so frequently seems to know that the strength of the troops is the same. But Breit knows that this is impossible. They can't have such a huge magic. They can use such magic to scout. This is only accidental. Since the enemy can penetrate the Leite Empire so boldly, the ability of their commanders must not be underestimated. Such awkward mobility is not impossible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A total of thirty times used to move more than a thousand people to move instantly, while also using scout magic to control this wide area, although getting their own help, but The sheer size of this magic is terrible. Even with the help of memory crystals for so long, Brett knows that he can't move thousands of people at the same time, let alone move freely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A 傀儡 has such power, so what is the true strength of the sage? The thought suddenly passed over in Breit’s mind, and he could not help but feel a shudder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But anyway, this battle he won! By the incredible power of the sorcerer, the enemy is now completely surrounded, no matter how embarrassing they can not escape. The 50,000 Thunder army has completely surrounded this army of less than 3,000 people. Brett was happy with his achievements, but did not expect that if his transfer was more efficient, then the Master would not consume the magic, then he can participate in the battle. If that's the case, it's really a victory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The enemy is acting, Mr. Boulder!" A soldier ran to the front of the horse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Going west."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All the troops speed up!" The nasty chase finally It’s over, and now those stinky mice can’t escape. The bridge in the west is the only way in that direction, and there are 4,000 soldiers there to defend. As long as the mice were dragged for a while, they only used two or three hours, and they didn't want to run. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beihan wearing the light armor of the cavalry, watching the enemy in front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This wood is their last hidden, but he knows that the enemy has found them. The enemy is waiting in front of the bridge, but they must break through them. Once they can't break the enemy's front, the enemies in all directions will rush up and destroy them all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to three hours. Behan knows this deeply. He has taken over the command and persuasion. This situation is too burdensome for the girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All military assault!" A little spare power can not be left, this is the decisive attack of the fish dead network. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three thousand cavalry rushed down, the hooves sounded earth-shattering, and the decisive assault began. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lei Te Army is not flustered, and their light-duty infantry teams are in an orderly separation, allowing the rear heavy arm spears to advance. The Legacy has always used this force to withstand the enemy cavalry shock, and Brett has left a sufficient number of heavy-loaded spearmen to resist the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gun erected as if the hedgehog had stretched out all the thorns, and the six-meter-long spear was a battlefield for the light cavalry. It is impossible to break through. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mercenaries in the march did not stop, they went on, and they were in a cone-shaped array, but the first person was very strange, he looked like a hand No weapons, just holding a whip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sharp whistle came and let the people in the woods know that they came when they attacked. There are more than sixty people left, including nine magicians. If the first wave of attacks does not defeat the enemy, everything depends on them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s our turn!" Lev exclaimed, then he waved his whip and drove in front of the three magician's car. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battlefield has been struggling. The battle was smooth at first, and with the blazing power of Liz, the enemy's spear defense was torn open at once, but Behan did not think that the enemy was equipped with so many magicians here. They rushed in, but the magical magic of the magicians did not separate me, and they immediately caught their footsteps. Although the enemy has a small amount of troops, but it occupies a geographical position, the ejected battle is extremely thick and difficult to break through. The battle becomes a melee, and the enemy is delaying the tactics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behan cut down the enemy in front of him and then looked back and forth. The whole situation is terrible, the enemy's front is completely entangled with them, and the latter is still maintaining a strict team shape, so that they can not get up. The damn magician kept rubbing their depths with various magic, causing huge casualties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Liss is fighting in front, she has put away the blazing - because this weapon is not suitable for use in the melee - use the lightning sword. This magic sword played a terrible power, and anyone who was in contact with it was immediately knocked down by electric shock, and there was no fighting or fighting. But even so, she still can't rush, because the attacks of the magicians are concentrated here, no one keeps up, she is forced back by the enemy's intensive weapons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A familiar figure suddenly rushed, and suddenly nailed into the enemy's front like a nail. This sprint is very fierce, Wei Yilian cut down four or five, smashing the Jianjia Lijian, struggling hard into the enemy. But the magicians immediately sent a bunch of explosive balls, bombarded here, so that others could not keep up with this gap, and the Lei Te soldiers arranged the shields into shield walls, which blocked him hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warrior is fully slashed, this shielded shield finally supports Living, together with the latter holder, was cut into two paragraphs, but it didn't work because the other shield blocked it. He is now alone in the middle of the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The armor of the body does not know how many attacks are blocked from him, and the enemy weapons are in all directions. If it is a normal situation, he is confident that he can deal with at least 50 enemies, but his bravery does not play a role in the face of such heavy shield infantry. Even if he wants to cut this shield, it is very difficult. The shield was surrounded by a cylinder around him, trapping him here and unable to rush out. Wei knows that he must retreat. If he continues to deepen, he will not be able to retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei vented and tore up the closed encirclement, which killed at least six people, but this is meaningless on the battlefield, he just licks this The opportunity is separated from the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wei!" A voice came, Wei looked back, it was bloody Behan, Behan’s horse in his hand, he took the reins Handed over to Wei. "Take a few people and attack the enemy's magician along the river!" Behan loudly ordered that he knows where the key to the war is. The most elite troops are not used to attack the enemy's most solid position, but instead Attack the enemy's weakest link. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will ride horses, but I won’t ride horses!" Wei didn't pick up the reins, but Behan stuffed him into his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now you must! Go now!" Behan’s tone is not to be refuted. The commander on the battlefield and the swordsman at the time of adventure are two completely different people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage galloped all the way, flew to the front of the fierce battlefield, the magic of the car The teacher recited a spell in the process. The three cars are flying side by side at a uniform speed. Lev's driving skills are very good, and the other two are not bad. Their task is to take them to the most suitable position for attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...The sword of judgment brought down by the gods is in my hands... By the roots of all things connected, the power is gathered and the enemy is beaten Into the abyss that can't be overwhelmed...the thunder of God!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Thunder of God accurately rushed to the enemy's intensive infantry queue, and the Reiter soldiers could only watch the huge deaths pounce on them. Their magicians did not use defensive spells to defend because they previously used magic to support the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge explosion exploded in the infantry queue, seven times in a row. Unlike the enemy's delayed release of magic, the mercenaries' magicians quickly released all their magic, in order to seduce the enemy. Their purpose was achieved. The panic caused by this incident was more terrible than the casualties caused. The infantry was injured by this blow, causing about 300 casualties, but the sound of the explosion shocked the enemy. The enemy infantrymen were in a panic, and the mercenaries took the opportunity to re-attack and suddenly reversed the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the Rite Army’s magician was also facing a devastating blow, because a small group of enemies broke through the weak link of the river in this chaos. The soldier's defense rushed to the front of the magician's queue. Wei’s vindictiveness played its due role, and all the magician’s attacks were blocked by vindictiveness, and then the enemies rushing to them were arbitrarily slashed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the loss of magical support, the Leiter army reluctantly resisted for a while, then completely defeated, the soldiers fled on all sides, and killed the red eyes The mercenaries were chasing after the situation, and suddenly there were so many new bodies falling on the ground, more than the whole battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright gathers the army and moves slowly. He has received news of the enemy and the troops defending the bridge, but in order to prevent this is another enemy's strategy - from the entire chase process in front, it is very possible, he still decided to move forward slowly . Previously, he temporarily arranged fifty magicians to take responsibility for defense. This is almost half of the army he sent out this time. Even if he dare not say annihilation, he can't be defeated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A telepathic signal suddenly appeared in his mind, telling him a terrible news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The whole army is advancing fast!" Brett roared, and could not attend the demeanor that he deliberately maintained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without time to clean the battlefield, Behan regained his army with the fastest speed. The lightly wounded continue to ride the horse, and the seriously wounded are placed in the car, and the body has no time to deal with it. The casualties and rapids of this battle were all he did not think of. They killed and injured more than 700 people, but the battle ended in an hour. The cart was vacated and loaded with the wounded. All the non-precious materials were burned or discarded, and the others were packed by the horses. All of this was carried out quickly and efficiently. Before the enemy arrived, they were separated from the encirclement and retreated westward. Only the body of one place and the magical bombardment of a blackened battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than 50 therapists are gathered here, everyone is on the forehead sweat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the last effort, the body is placed in the center of the huge triangular coat of arms symbolizing the goddess Leica, all therapists put their own The power is released and concentrated in the center. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor stood on the side watching, his body was shaking with excitement and expectations. Almost all of the world's top healers have been concentrated here, only to perform the resurrection that has appeared in the legend. His son, Max's body is emitting a strong but soft light, and, from this far-reaching point, it seems to be twitching slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therapists began to sing a song that others could not understand, and the song was full of soft and loving charm. In this voice, their power release also reached a peak, and the light on Max's body was further enhanced, and the people who were present were strongly bathed in this light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Emperor Victor looked at this scene, his eyes fixed on the body of the Son of Love. The golden scepter in the hands of the emperor has fallen to the ground, but he has no feeling at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, there seems to be an irresistible signal in the darkness, the whole light suddenly disappears, and the body remains motionless, everyone knows that the resurrection Failed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, please forgive me, I have tried my best!" A moment, apologize for his failure. His body trembled a little because of overdraft, and the sweat drenched his white robes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is there really no way?" The emperor asked weakly, his last hope was also cut off, and the resurrection of Max was impossible. In fact, when the French first came to see Max's body, he made this point, but the emperor still insisted on trying it. "Is there no way? You can't do it with the first auxiliary sacrifice?" Victor's eyes revealed such sadness and despair, which can touch the lion, but in the eyes of the person in front of him. Less than a trace of mercy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think there is nothing in this world that can protect the prince from the guardian robe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "&nbsp; "Guardian robe?" Emperor Teng sat up straight, his eyes glowed with new brilliance, as if the drowning people saw the last straw. "Is that thing true? I mean... is that artifact not a legend?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is true, that holy object is now preserved in the temple. The most secret place..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Fasan!" Victor suddenly rushed up and held the hand of the law - he was almost Kneeling on the ground. At this moment, he is not an emperor, a brave ambitious home, but a father who is eager to love, an old man who can no longer bear more blows. "I beg you, try to save Max! I can promise you anything..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..." The law reveals a distressed expression, "Tibetan The guardian’s robe is the place where the goddess cares, only the big priest has the ability to enter there...except that she can go in and get the holy thing!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Is there any way?" The emperor stared closely at the eyes of a man of the same age as him. His eyes only pleaded. "I beg you to think of a way!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The law faded for a while, his expression tone sounded not very sure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have a solution, but I need a large number of magicians to help!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I I can send my entire Royal Magician group..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therapist’s face reveals a smile that is undetectable to anyone, a smirk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I do my best..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After breaking through the encirclement of the Leite army, the mercenaries then played an ultra-imaginary marching speed. In the memory of Kim, this next step is all spent in the whisper of the ear. Their high-speed advancement—or high-speed escape—has not given any chance to the Leite border stationed forces, and they rushed out of danger and entered the territory of the Red Alliance. In the whole process, they only encountered a small patrol team, and the latter was almost immediately defeated by the offensive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold sits at the tent and eats hard and tasteless ration bread, which is the first time he has sat quietly for three days to eat. This unpleasant road is finally over. This afternoon, they will join the friendly army, and now they don’t have to run so hard. Kim does not care about other things. For him, the life of temporary mercenaries is over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one last thing left in his heart, that is the incredible question raised by the half-fairy girl that night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A small cloud that covers the sunset is blown away by the wind, and the last radiance of the sun scatters on the earth, leaving the golden body with a long shadow on the ground. . The magician eagerly eats while watching his shadow stretch with a slow speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold still remembers the battle very clearly. In that battle, he realized the feeling of the battlefield and really felt the battle and victory. When releasing the thunder of God, Kim released it to the enemy's most intensive position without hesitation. At that time, there was a feeling of finding himself. Kim never thought that he would kill a few days. Hundreds of people. Is this the so-called bloodthirsty? I didn't feel that I found out how terrible I was afterwards. He remembers that when chasing and defeating the defeated soldiers, he used the last remaining magic to attack the soldiers who did not help to escape. At that time, it seemed that the body was full of excitement, and even the magic was playing in an extraordinary way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician swallowed the last bite of bread and stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
