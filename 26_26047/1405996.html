Her feelings told her that something had gotten into her trousers. After confirming the feeling, Mink made a very loud and miserable scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei Yiyue, although in the dark, but by the moonlight, he can still roughly distinguish the situation around - Mink is trying to lick her leg She didn't dare to check what was inside her trousers. Wei’s first thought was the same as that of Mingke – something dangerous was getting into her trousers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We Chong the past, Mingke saw Wei come over, her heart immediately calmed down, she stopped the unhelpful action, cooperate with Wei. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We carefully turned Mink’s trousers with his hands—he wore iron gloves on his hands, not afraid of things like scorpions—he didn’t I found anything (the leaf fell out when Mink was smashing his legs), and he continued to check, but he didn’t find anything suspicious until he rolled Mink’s pants on his lap. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We looked at Mink with a questioning eye, and Mink himself was stunned. Of course, she didn’t know about this leaf. She could only misunderstand it. Her own illusion, her face apologized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei confirmed that the girl was no longer in danger and finally relaxed. Just when he was about to stand up, the girl suddenly hugged him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This action has not been rationally allowed, Mink is only instinctive and does not want this man to leave, although only a few days of travel, but this man has touched her heart A subtle string. But my heart has not confirmed this feeling, just in the moment of holding Wei, Mink found that he really fell in love with this man. Wei Yishi couldn't react from Mink's sudden movement. Before he had any action, the girl's lips were printed on his lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a signal that I can understand again. Just before he realized what happened, Wei Fajue’s suppressed instinct has already erupted. Ke is kissing him, but he is tightly taking the initiative to kiss the girl in her arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been no such impulse for a long time, and since I vowed to revenge for my dear, I am determined to abandon the feelings between men and women. However, Wei is always a very healthy man. Instinct is only suppressed and cannot be eliminated. Although she is very fond of this girl, Wei is deliberately avoiding more contact with her (after knowing that she is a girl), but when Mingke is dressed as a man, two people (mainly Mink) I have accumulated enough emotions that can be converted into love. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei tightly hugged the girl, at this moment, he forgot everything else, the whole world only left him and Mink in his arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold was pulled up again by the wolf, now he has received more The treatment - the two feet were tied to the wolf, so it is more convenient for the bad mount to torture him. But in fact, Kim has no way to take care of these things, and the effect of the beatings just received is now fully revealed. In particular, the few hits on his head, the impact of these few shocks made him now in a state of half-stunned and half-stunned - but just let him feel the pain from all over the body . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-orc around the magician looked at the gold that had actually lost his ability to escape with a violent gaze, preventing him from escaping. As the magician just ransacked, he actually lost the opportunity to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even in a dizzy state, Kim is still surprised by the sudden loss of magic. He can confirm that his magic has recovered a lot, and he can confirm that he has never missed the spell, but magic is no way to use it. In the embarrassment, he began to know why the Orcs didn't kill themselves right away, why didn't they have bows and arrows - because they knew they couldn't use magic. Although the mind is very vague, but Kim also knows that the key to the magic can not be used is the strange handcuffs in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orcs have no pity to instigate the tired mounts and move forward quickly. They are getting closer and closer to the main force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There seemed to be some figure in the distance, and Leif was immediately alert. He let his body hide under a camouflage cloth and carefully observed the distance. The sharp sight of the thieves caught something that was moving in the distance. It was not one or two, but a large group. Without any detailed investigation, Lev immediately understood what he saw, and he quickly left the hills and ran to where his companions are now. You must be prepared immediately, otherwise you will be finished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Temporary break!" After arriving at the oasis, Gera made the order. . The damn magician dragged them all day and a half, and now he hasn't found the squad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-beasts have wolves to rest, but the wolves suddenly reacted, and they smelled the thieves who had not dissipated. The Orcs found their mounts and they quickly reacted and they found clues to the adventurers. The Orcs immediately launched a search operation, and the half-orcs of several teams began searching for this oasis with the most sensitive wolves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smell was interrupted when it was on the edge of a small river. The vigilant adventurers waded up and the water covered their smell and footprint. The wolf's sense of smell has lost its effect, and they can only keep turning in the place where the smell finally disappears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you use the river to cover up the smell?" Gera was not surprised to hear the search team’s report. He knew his goal to catch up from the start. Very embarrassing, but as long as the adventurers are still in this place, he has the confidence to find them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In small teams, the Orcs formed a huge search network. They use whistle to connect with each other, and all the orcs walk under the wolf. Although the wolf has no way to track the smell, as long as they are close to the adventurer, they can smell the scent and catch the guys who are hiding. This plan is perfect, as long as the adventurers have not left in this oasis, they can be caught. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The search ended in darkness, and the half-beasts combed the entire oasis like a comb, but found nothing. In addition to the smells that were first smelled, the wolf did not find anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it feels a little unlikely, Gera only admits that the adventurers have left the oasis. After a night here, on the second day, the Orcs set off early. Before leaving, Gera left a team of 100 people to continue searching for this oasis - he always felt that there were adventurers left. Inside this oasis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The half-orcs have left!" The thieves who went out to scout brought you The good news is, "Only a small team has been left."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Few teams? How much?" "About a hundred Let's go around."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One hundred!" Behan is carefully estimating the meaning of this quantity. Why do half-orcs leave a team? Did they find flaws, which is impossible. It is likely that this is just an intuitive order from their commander. However, it is still quite difficult to deal with these one hundred orcs. It seems that it is better not to conflict with them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We can leave now!" said Elna, it is impossible for a hundred orcs to monitor the entire oasis, and it is absolutely impossible to find them leaving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time you can escape the half-orc, Behan, and his analysis of the enemy is really correct. As Behan pointed out, the strength of the Orcs is that they are riding wolves - the wolves can track the smell of the enemy, and their weakness is that they are riding wolves because they are too dependent on the wolf's sense of smell, so that actually Searching for wolves instead of half-orcs. Therefore, once you can escape the smell of the wolf, the half-orcs can't find them. Therefore, at the suggestion of Behan, the four adventurers painted a sap of a tree with a strong smell on their body, and easily escaped the search that the half-orcs thought they were impenetrable. Those half-orcs did not even find their horses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the arrival of the Orcs made everyone know that the magician would not come. Since the half-orcs that Kim wants to open have already caught up here, the fate of Kim is conceivable. Although everyone knows that the situation of the magician is not optimistic, they still try to think in the right direction - they use the words of Babe to lick themselves at the same time - Kim has already returned to Hope City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adventurers are moving fast, and soon they can't see the oasis in the distance. Because there are only four people, they are riding horses (alena and babe ride together). Everyone didn't say anything, everyone (including Babe) was worried about the magician. Because they planned to turn a big circle to Hope City, they are now heading east. At noon, they arrived at a place that used to be a mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A miracle carved out of the wind and sand appears in the sight of the adventurers. It should have been a mountain in ancient times, but since it became a wilderness, it has become the raw material for nature's display skills. The wind and sand eroded a magnificent picture that resembled a castle. The rock showed various gestures under the carvings of the sand. Each one was magical and beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's beautiful! Go up and see how?" Lev proposed. Although he is also worried about gold, he wants to break this dead atmosphere. But this proposal is superfluous because they will soon be forced to climb the castle. The baby who was eating the sixth meal on the shoulder of Babe suddenly gave a scream - it saw another group of half-orcs coming here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After everyone figured out the baby’s alarm, they immediately took action. After hiding the horse in a cave, everyone climbed this one. Rock Mountain, they now hope that the half-orcs are just passing by, not purposeful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-orc who came here is the detachment. Because they have not found the trail of the adventurers, they are now going back, thinking and pulling The generals meet. However, I did not expect to hit their target here by mistake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adventurers on the mountain watch carefully the half-orcs who are rushing here, so they are dead, it seems that the Orcs are counted here. Rest awhile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 02<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orcs stopped at the place where the adventurers were. In fact, they don't know that they have their goals here. It's just a coincidence. The commander of the Orcs is just a coincidence that they plan to take a break here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they just stopped and the wolves found an unusual smell. Without much effort, the Orcs found the horses, and now even the idiots know that their goal is near this zone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the adventurers hiding on the top of the mountain saw the half-orcs pull out their horses, they knew that this time they could not escape, no matter The Orcs will find them. They don’t have the supplies on the horseback. They can’t cross this wilderness. They have no other choices now, only one war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in any case, they only have four people, even if they add that baby, there are only five, and there are about five orphans below. Coupled with their mounts, they are now a pair of two hundred. Behan estimated the combat power, even if it is estimated in the best form, they can destroy 80 to 100 half-orcs in frontal combat, only one-tenth of the enemy. The only hope for victory is to fully use the power of Babe's Warcraft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, it is impossible to completely eliminate these half-orcs by Warcraft alone, especially these extremely powerful wolf cavalry. Once Warcraft is on the scene, the half-orcs will surely launch an offensive and destroy all these adventurers. Even if the Orcs did not launch an attack, it is impossible to destroy the half-orcs by a single World of Warcraft attack. The space here is large enough, and the wolf cavalry has sufficient room for manoeuvre. They will keep track of them and then find the most suitable one. The way to solve them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orcs did not conduct a search, and they had two opinions among them. One party thinks that it is necessary to start a careful search of this area immediately, find those adventurers early, and on the other hand think that the geography is complicated. If you search separately, it will easily give the adventurers a chance to break through, and increase the casualties in vain. It is the best policy to surround this place first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orcs eventually unified their opinions, and they split the team to monitor the entire area while preparing to search the area. There is not much manpower needed to surround it, and a wolf cavalry can monitor a large piece. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But before the Orcs had begun to act, an adventurer suddenly jumped out of a corner. The thief used all the dirty words he could know to ruthlessly insult the half-orcs. In the few seconds that the half-orcs did not respond, Lev had enough time to go from their parents to the great-grandparents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lev ran back, of course, from time to time with a few knives to block the enemy's pursuit, the half-orc in the fury of the next stalker's fierce pursuit of the fast thieves. Those who are old and experienced do not think that this is a trap, but their current intelligence points out that there will never be more than ten adventurers. What can ten adventurers do for the five hundred wolf cavalry? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lev turned a long, narrow canyon, although narrow, but enough for three wolves to go together, the half-orcs did not hesitate to continue to catch up. The thieves who fled in front of them flew at a speed that only those who escaped could reach, and there was no slower than the tired wolf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a life-based bet. Lev has removed all the equipment that might have dragged him before, and only he can take on the bait. He did perform very well. Before reaching the end of the canyon, the Orcs could not get close to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The front of the canyon is a basin with cliffs on all sides, and the wolf cavalry is behind Lev, flowing in here. At the heights of Behan and Babe, they were overjoyed. They did not expect the Orcs to be so easy. They immediately marched toward the entrance to the canyon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The endurance of human beings is no match for the wolves after all. After rushing into the basin, Lev’s speed inevitably slows down, and now the Orcs can approach each other. The distance between them. There was no way to go ahead, and the Orcs formed a fan shape, pushing Lev to the bottom of the cliff. Seeing that the damn guy had no way to escape, but suddenly a rope was dropped on the cliff. At the beginning of the millennium, the thief grabbed the rope and began to climb up. The first half-orc who chased the cliff was slashed, but the tip of the knife just passed under the thief's foot. The Orc uttered an angry cry, but Lev did not pay attention to the sound of his feet. He used both hands and feet to speed up the as much as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a roar on the side of a cliff. No, it was three roars. A huge three-headed dog showed his body on the cliff. After the enemy, it immediately threw himself into the top of the half-orc who was preparing for the bow and arrow with the thunder, and the three bloody mouths bite the three orcs into two in a few seconds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a hurry, the half-orcs did not come and organized effective resistance, the three-headed dog ravaged among them, its fangs and claws in the half-orcs Caused a lot of damage. In a panic, some half-orcs began to escape to the outside, that is, the canyon. But at the gate of the canyon, two people (actually only one person) are waiting for them. Lev's magic sword and baby's flame can exert the greatest power in this narrow passage. The half-orc has not yet come and rushed to The front was knocked down, and most of them were turned into coke along with their mounts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adventurers’ traps are perfect, and this is the best tactic that can be imagined in a hurry. In their prediction, after climbing the cliff, Lev met with Elna and then went outside to control their horses and supplies. The baby (not Babe) and Behan will block these half-orcs inside, let Warcraft You can play the most fighting power, even if they can't get rid of the half-orcs, it is not a problem to recapture the horse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s an ordinary half-orc soldier, I’m afraid it’s completely chaotic in front of this terrible World of Warcraft, but these wolf cavalry can be the soldiers of the Wild Bet Corps. In other words, it is the batch of the half-orc who is strong and top, and the top is to die. After a brief chaos, they quickly resumed order and began to attack World of Warcraft. The first is a wave of arrows and rain to the huge body of Warcraft. A lot of this arrow rain is aimed at the thieves who are still climbing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leif didn’t have to look at it and knew that he was now a target, because the whistling of the arrow was coming over, but fortunately he had already reached the top. He let go of the rope and grabbed the edge of the cliff directly with his hands. With both hands and one force, the whole person climbed onto the cliff and now finally got out of the threat of the arrow rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wolf cavalry pulled out the sword and rushed to Warcraft, although the three-headed dog used its teeth to constantly eliminate these nasty little things, but after all It has only three mouths, and the half-orcs will never stand still and wait for it to bite. There was not much time left, and the three dogs had a lot of wounds on their bodies. It was only a matter of time before they were knocked down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orc officers are screaming their men, and the Orcs have focused their attacks on the throat and head of the three dogs. The tactics of efficiency come to fight. Some of the Orcs began to attack the adventurers in the canyon, but with the baby's terrible vomiting power, the adventurer can still resist these attacks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;earthquake! The panic about this natural phenomenon immediately occupies everyone's heart, especially the adventurers (Babe and Behan), knowing that they are now in a place where the terrain is extremely complicated and dangerous. If there is a landslide, there is no The man is running. The Orcs several of the orcs who are archery are affected by this shock, and their arrows are flying into the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get out of here right away!" Lev didn't get up and shouted at Elna, who was not far away. It is dangerous now, under the erosion of sand. This place is beautiful but not stable. They just happened to have an earthquake in this most unfortunate time and space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An arrow shot by a half-orc long bow draws a beautiful arc in the sky and falls on the back of the thief who is trying to get up. From a most appropriate angle - if it is a serious aim, it may not be so accurate - to shoot into the thief's unprepared body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Lev is not in a position that he is trying to get up, if he wears his leather armor, if... he won’t be beaten by this The arrow shot through the heart, but if none of this happened, the arrow passed through Lev's rib space, and the arrow tip ruthlessly passed through the heart and emerged from his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leif stood up, he wanted to run in the direction of Elna, but a sense of paralysis suddenly spread throughout his body, only Taking a step, the feet are soft and uncontrollable. Elna looked at Lev and fell down in front of him. He had an arrow shaft behind his back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am going to die? This was Lev’s last thought, and with this thought he spit out his last breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 03<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power contained in the earth is fully vented, perhaps except this place This wilderness has no way to reflect this tremendous power. Due to the erosion of sand, most of the areas composed of rocks are small and large. Under the influence of the energy emitted by the earth, the unscientific layout has finally revealed its hidden danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire region has collapsed, just like all beautiful and fragile things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two people in the canyon are certainly not able to escape this catastrophe, and they fell down on both sides, in a deafening voice, the entire canyon Was filled out. In addition to this canyon, the basin that was just a battlefield, and almost all the places around it without a solid foundation, were all buried in this huge vibration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The biggest loss is the half-orc, and the surrounding cliffs collapse like water. There is not enough room for the five hundred wolf cavalry to take refuge. They all disappeared. Rolling down the rock composed of waves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vibration finally stopped, and now it is still silent, only the few undead horses are moving around uneasy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large stone was pushed away from below by a person, and a person climbed up from this pile of stones, and the original white therapist gown on her is now It was full of dust and became a light gray. Elna climbed out of the newly formed cave, and then pulled out the body she had been holding, and the body with infinite vitality was already lifeless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deadly arrow has been pulled out, and although it has been pierced by a arrow, there is not much blood near Lev’s wounds - half-orcs are painted The poison on the arrow played a role, but these poisons are actually superfluous, because with or without poison, this arrow can cause fatal injuries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After you can't see a person around you, rightly, you can't see a living thing in the field of vision. Just half of the orcs, Warcraft seems to be just unreal. Dream, but when the dream woke up, there was a body that could not move. Elna is not a fool. She knew the intentions of two men early in the morning, but she actually knew that it was impossible to integrate with humans. No matter how diligent the two people are, she will not give enough echoes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What to do now, I didn’t think that the adventure that was originally an episode turned out to be the end of their group. The first is that Wei and Mingke disappeared into the black storm, and then the whereabouts of gold is unknown (should be more sinister). Now it is the two partners who were swallowed up by this terrible earthquake. The only partner around them has already lost their hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elna’s first thought was the power, the power she had vowed not to use (although it was used again at the contest, but It is not conscious, purely instinct overcomes reason, so there is no blame for it. Only this power can help her. However, the reason she came out this time is to hone herself by travel and say goodbye to that power! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alna looked at the thief who couldn’t move in his arms. I don't know who ever said: Only when you lose, you know the preciousness of such things. Compared with Behan, Lev pleaded with her clumsiness and dullness, but she admired the clumsiness and dullness caused by inexperience. Behan’s skill is too skillful, but instead gives her the feeling that “he must have said the same thing to other women”. After carefully scrutinizing the body that would not move again, Elna realized that she had gone too far on the road of feelings, far beyond her own expectations. She now has a way to save this anyway. The thought of a man is so strong that he is even surprised. Now think carefully, if you don't know that two people are impossible to combine, you must have responded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aerna carefully observed around, it seems that no half-orc escaped the catastrophe, and now it should be safe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Leica goddess! Please forgive me! I have to violate the vows made under your throne!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a short confession - because then dragging on, after Pluto takes Lev’s life, nothing is useless - after that, Elna begins to meditate in the heart of the goddess In his special prayer, Lev's body has a considerable damage - that is, the arrow hurts, so it takes extra strength. Fortunately, in terms of the size of the wound, the wound is not too big, if Lev If you die under the sword, then even Elna can't help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White light was uploaded from Elna’s body, although she did not prepare for this sacred ritual, she even wore her dirty body. The sorcerer's robe, but the goddess accepted her prayer. The energy is quickly condensed in the air, and the light forms a beam of light that directs the sky. If anyone sees it, he will think that the god will come directly to the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, it is exactly the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The part of the will and power of the goddess of healing and life, from her place, to the world through the body of Elna, even The body of the dead Lev, the wound began to heal, and the toxin was smashed in front of the power of God. In just a few tens of seconds, the body became intact, and even a scar was not left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A shrine that shines in white and pure light appears in front of Pluto who is carrying a large number of souls. The power represented by these two gods is in opposition. The endless light of the Leica is in front of the dark body that absorbs all the radiant Pluto. The glowing god asked Pluto to hand over one of the souls he took away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pluto stunned, although he couldn’t give up any soul, but he didn’t want to make a concession because he didn’t have any special soul and the gods in front. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief in front of himself showed signs of life, but Elna did not see that the load brought by the goddess was too great. For this ultimate spell, she must temporarily sacrifice all her feelings. Resurrection is the ultimate magic in all healing magic (the therapist was once a magician, so the treatment is actually a kind of magic), only those strongest, the most firm belief in Leica, and status The highest therapist can get this gift. This spell will cause Leica and Pluto (or other death gods) to have the most taboo positive conflicts in the gods, so no one will cast them unless they are forced to do so. In particular, to resurrect incomplete corpses, therapists with this power have not been able to survive the entire history of the continent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White light finally dissipated, Lev lying on the ground has recovered, he is now sleeping, if Elna does not say, kill him I don't believe that I have ever died once. He only thinks that he has fainted at most once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arina is exhausted, although it is not the first time to use this spell, but it is the first time to resurrect an incomplete corpse. In order to resurrect Lev, she consumed too much power, and bluntly said that in the next few weeks, she did not want to be treated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Elna sat on the floor and gasped – this time her vision had not recovered - she heard some voices, some apparently belonging to the creatures the sound of. At the moment she didn't have any defensive ability, just because of her intuition, she pushed Lev to the cave just now. Lev is still in a deep sleep, he will not wake up for a while, his body rolled to the deepest part of the cave under the influence of gravity. Outside the cave mouth just enough for people to climb up, there is no body in the depths where a thief who has just seceded from the hands of death is sleeping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two stones form a solid arch bridge that protects two people (and a beast), but after the danger has passed, the arch that protects them has become the biggest obstacle for two people to escape. Any attempt to move a stone The move will bring disaster to the people below. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s so hard! It is too tired to slowly dig a passage from the rock by the force of the sword of the earth in your hand. After discovering that he could not rely on "push" to escape from this place, Behan only chose to "dig" this method. However, because the stones are not very closely aligned, the actual amount of work is not very large. That being said, but when Behan saw the outside, it was already dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When looking at the surrounding rock, Behan felt that Elna and Lev were not saved! However, those half-orcs probably have to put them on their backs. Thinking of this, Behan’s heart is much better. Since it is impossible to find the body of a companion in this place, Behan gave up the idea. But he allowed Babe to search wildly in the rock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, I used to be a mercenary, and I saw more deaths than others (he once buried his comrades more than once), and Behan was silent for two people. A few minutes later I immediately thought of one of the most practical problems - his stomach was hungry after intense physical activity. There was a sound of horses in the distance, and Behan was overjoyed. It seems that those horses with supplies are still there. Don't worry about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......The thief in the depths of the hole stretched out a lazy waist. For him, this is just an ordinary sleep. After he wakes up, he I even thought that everything just happened was just a dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the dark rocks around tell him the environment he is in, and in confusion, the thief climbed out of the cave. Surrounded by a pile of shards of stones, I told the newly awakened person about the catastrophe that had just happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s not a dream! There is an earthquake!" Lev, who muttered to himself, finally thought of the most important thing - his friends went there. What? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Eat something!" Behan looked at the little girl while eating. The horse has lost three horses, but the rest of the supplies are enough. He bluntly blamed the three horses on the earthquake, but did not think about the possibility that they would be taken away. There are only two people left now, and the cost of this adventure is really too great. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behan’s words became a fuse, and Babe, who had already been full of tears, suddenly burst into tears. Behan’s brother’s indifference to the whereabouts of other people has deeply hurt Babe. Of course, she does not know that the indifference of Behan was cultivated in the experience of burying her companions many times. Babe’s loud crying echoed in the empty night sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 04<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leif is jumping fast in the rock, the panic in the heart is temporarily Overwhelmed everything else. Now he has one of the worst premonitions in his heart - his partners may have misunderstood that he has been buried alive and have now left. If this is the case, then Lev may have to wait in this wilderness to die. Without water, no dry food, he has no hope to live alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leif also considered the situation in which his partner was unfortunate in this disaster, but since he has nothing to do - Leif always feels that he is a luck comparison The poor one - that is probably not the case for others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night, the look looks the same everywhere, there is no way to tell the direction, and Lev feels like a headless fly. The panic in the heart slowly increases with the passage of time. As the panic gradually turned into despair, an unexpected savior came from afar, and a clear cry came, and Lev immediately recognized that it was Babe’s cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a break, the three started a natural discussion about Elna Things. Behan always thought that Elna was with Lev, but Leif said that she didn't see her when she woke up. So everyone decided to go here and wait for Elna - she will have nothing to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s really weird, I also had the illusion of my own death during the earthquake!" Lev’s words saw him halfway through His amazed gaze, the focus of this gaze is not his face, but his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lev took off the dress and saw a hole in the back that matched the hole. Judging from the dress, the owner of the dress was killed by something like an arrow or a gun (at least Shoot through). However, the fact is that Lev's chest is intact, and even a scar has not been left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Combining these contradictions, plus Elna, who was originally with Lev, has now lost his course, etc., and the adventurers have come A preliminary conclusion, they started searching right away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At dawn, the results came out. A string of horseshoe prints mixed with wolf paw prints, a stone in the original basin position was opened, revealing a large space - inside is a room, a hundred wolves can be hidden in the gap between the stones cavalry. The evidence for everything is obvious. It was Elna who saved Lev and she was taken away by the Orcs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two men looked at each other and they all saw the answer in their hearts in the eyes of the other party. They all had the same plan - to save Elna. The only problem now is Babe, this hopeless action can't let this little girl participate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bebee is going too!" When the little girl listened to the opinions of two people, she immediately made such a cry, "Bebe is going to save Ai Sister Erna!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Babe! You have to know, this time is no more than the last time, only a few of us, the chances of success are very small..." The husband said to Babe in a way that he did not speak to the child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know!" Babe interrupted Lev’s words. "But you can go, why can't I go. Is it only you like Elna's sister?" "This sentence is so direct, a word hit the target. Maybe Babe means very pure, but this sentence also proves that Babe is not the little girl who can't see anything in Lev's mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Things are settled like this. Although there should be no other things right now, the accident happened when the adventurers planned to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bebe fell off while skipping a stone, behind this stone there was a hole she had not found before. Immediately, the two adults in the back heard two voices in the hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people rushed forward, they looked at the cave about one meter deep, and Babe was sitting on one's stomach at the moment. Under her ass is the body of an old man wearing a very old wizard's gown, who is hurting his teeth because of this unexpected blow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people are walking in this wilderness. They are now using a sunscreen cloak together, and the girl is very close to the warrior around her, so that the cloak that was originally used only for one person can now protect two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that night's passion, Wei did not spend much time in self-satisfaction. Since everything has already happened, it is futile to blame yourself for not being determined, and regretting that you have violated the vows and so on. Wei is not a lost aristocratic child of the mainland. If he is like this, then the spring breeze with the girl is not a big deal. He does not have to bear any responsibility at all, but has the capital to boast to others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in Wei’s hometown, if a man gets the woman’s first ye, then he will take responsibility for this joy, he must This girl is a wife. On the other hand, if it wasn't for her first time, then the man could use this as a new number for the hunting spectator. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Mink is still a virgin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he is still running for revenge, although he has no way to provide any protection to Mink, but in Wei’s heart, he has decided to marry her. . Therefore, according to the customs of their hometown, Wei holds a weapon in one hand (of course, a sword) and proposes a marriage to Mingk with one hand (dry food for travel) (this is a custom on the dark continent. In order to propose to the woman Men must show the woman and the woman’s family that they have the ability to protect her and have the ability to support her. But as time goes by, this behavior has become a kind of marriage proposal, and everyone actually does not care about marriage. Whether the weapon and food of the person is used by himself and himself. The father’s performance is to evaluate whether the suitor is equipped with his or her daughter in the usual performance.) Unexpectedly, Mingke did not directly agree. Because on the lost continent, marriage is not elopement without the approval of parents. (In the dark continent, if the woman agrees and the parents object, the man can use force to take the woman from his father's protection. If he succeeds, then the marriage is valid, they become legal couples). Although I have been willing to do so, I still have the consent of my parents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How should his life be positioned? After the great change, he issued a vow of hopeless revenge in the tomb of his relatives. Although he knew that he could not beat the eight-eyed demon, it was impossible to find him again, but Wei still had no return. Going on the road to revenge. After meeting this group of companions and getting the Demon Sword, I had a little confidence in the first time of revenge, but in any case, I have no spare capacity to maintain a family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abandon the idea of ​​revenge, and live a life with this woman who loves you! An idea that emerged in the brain made Wei himself chill. How can he have this idea? But the idea was like a horrible snake entangled in prey, and refused to leave the mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Impossible, the vows made by the blood of your loved ones must not be violated! Wei wants to drive away the snake in his mind! He is ashamed of even this idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You lie!" The snake did not back down. "From the moment you set off, you know that revenge is impossible! All you want is to die." Eight eyes are on the hands of the devil. Since it is impossible, why do you still have to? Forget the past, with this woman, your future will be very happy! She loves you very much, and you like her very much."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No!" Wei’s heart made a roar and extinguished all opposing opinions. The personality he developed from his childhood did not allow such shameful thoughts. As a swordsman, especially the glory of a Juggernaut gives him a strong sense of self-respect and honor, there is absolutely no way to offset the pain of the past. It is only blood that can wash away the blood of his heart! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are advancing in this complex mood. On the one hand, he knows that he can't take care of Mink – he can't even protect his own safety. How can he protect the safety of another person? On the other hand, he has to bear the relative responsibility - after all, he has a body of Mink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this unclear contradiction, Wei and Mingke saw the city walls of Hope City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 05<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This journey is finally over, when the wall is seen, both people Think so, but now the real problem is just beginning! When they are in a safe place, they have to face some very troublesome problems. How to deal with fat uncle is a big problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I have seen the walls, I actually have enough distance between them and the city for a long time. It is still a wilderness, but the sun is not so poisonous, and the grass and bushes can be seen on the ground. The cloak is no longer necessary, and now two people can no longer be attached to a cloak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei suddenly felt dangerous, and a wind with a dangerous atmosphere was blowing over here. Although he does not know what is going to happen, he can appreciate that there is murderousness approaching. He quickly ran up a dirt slope and looked far and wide. Mink, who didn't know what was going, followed him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a group of things that are invisible in the distance, although the distance is very far away, but at this moment Wei has got enough information from the smell of the air. It’s a half-orc! They are coming again! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hurry up and leave!" Wei said to the girl around him that he had judged that they were on the route of the Orcs marching, and at the current speed. Will definitely be caught up before entering the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong!" Mingke still doesn't know what happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The half-orc came!" Wei grabbed the girl's hand and ran away and explained it to him with the other hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jella’s decision is almost crazy, he is going to be next to Hope City Grab a few people to the top. At the moment in Hope City, there must be a powerful magical corps sitting in the town, and with the strength of his hand, even a little defense is impossible. If the human beings in the city immediately went out to fight in the city, I am afraid that they should not want to go back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Gera is willing to take the risk. He concluded that humans would not come out to fight, and the last battle gave them a deep impression that they would treat these thousands of wolf cavalry as a bait. They will definitely hold the wall and watch it change. The wolf cavalry can find the right prey under the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can’t escape! Wei once again judged the speed of a half-orc and himself and reached this conclusion. The gas that had been run by the girl around him could not breathe. Although Wei can now determine that the Orcs have not found them, he also knows that he is unlikely to escape this chase. Now his brain is thinking fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We stopped the pace, Mink also stopped, her chest was violently ups and downs, and the running just was too much for her. "Go here!" Wei made a gesture to her and took her to a bush. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go in! Hide in it and don't come out." Wei used a tough sunscreen cloak to in turn to pack the gram, let her hide in this rather dense shrub In the middle of the bush. If the battle is inevitable, at least let the girl who has no fighting power hide first. However, Wei also knows that the mounts of the Orcs can easily find Mink. If you want to keep Mingke safe, the cover of the shrub alone will not work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Big Brother! Don't you come in and hide?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No! You stay here, I am going to lead the Orcs!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Big Brother! You must be careful!" Mink looked at Wei's firm look and suddenly had a terrible hunch. She remembered that when her grandfather went out, she left with this look, and never returned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassured! I will be back!" Just as Wei planned to leave, Mink suddenly hugged Wei, and before Wei had not responded, he was in Wei. Kissed on the lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You must come back! I am waiting for you in the city!" Mink looked at Wei with affection, "I will wait for you!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will be back!" Wei answered in sign language. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orcs drive the mounts forward, they are now in an anxious state, On the one hand, no one has been found until now, and on the other hand, they are also at risk. On the one hand, I want to evacuate earlier, but on the other hand, I am not willing to take it back empty-handed, so that they are now particularly sick and fierce. Therefore, when they see a human figure in the distance, they change the direction of the advancement and chase after it, it is not surprising. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei’s fast running, just like what he thought, when the Orc saw him, he chased it. Although Wei ran very fast, there is always no way for a person to test the strength of the wolf. The distance between the half-orc and him is gradually approaching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have already prepared myself a battle plan. After letting Mink hide, he will go all the way to Hope City. According to previous judgments, when the Orc catches up with him, he should almost reach the attack range of the bow and arrow on the wall. In this distance, he can get the bow and arrow and magic fire support on the wall, and the Orcs don't want to win more. In this case, Wei has a 90% grasp of the half-orcs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the facts did not follow Wei’s plan. First of all, after discovering clear goals, the speed of the half-orcs is much faster, and they are desperately trying to drive the wolves forward. Secondly, Wei estimates only the approximate distance. He did not count those trenches. The uneven ground makes a big difference between the actual distance and the visual inspection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, before a long distance from the intended goal, Wei was caught up by the Orcs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We stopped, he didn’t need to watch, just listen to the sound and know what happened. He began to adjust his breathing and prepare for the battle. Even if he died, there must be enough enemies to give himself back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When gold was sent to the Orc’s military camp, he still did not The way to lift the strange handcuffs on your hand. In these few days, he has tried all the methods he can come up with, but it is not effective for this handcuff. Since I have experienced several great wars, I can’t find much information about the Orc civilization in the books of human beings. Therefore, Kim knows nothing about this handcuff that limits his magic. Because of this, What he did was actually a futile move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
