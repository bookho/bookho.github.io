			<div id="content">Lev left the sneak attack in silence, and now he knew that his skills were not degraded at all. He did a very good job just now, quietly approaching the enemy, and then piercing the joint of the first enemy's back neck with a short sword. He did not give him a chance to scream while taking his life. Similarly, in Before the second enemy returned to discover, Lev's knife opened his blood vessels and trachea at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How long have you not used it? Lev’s mind remembered that the last time he used this assassination was to attack a bandit camp. At that time, he was so neat and ruined the sentinel, and wanted to get some oil from there. The accident caused him to run into the magician. With the help of magic as a helper and then met that bunch of powerful partners, I don’t know how long it has been used. Although the means of assassination are not so bright and straightforward, according to Leif’s own moral principles, if the enemy uses a less-than-light means, it is justified by whatever means. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, when you are not proud, there must be a lot of enemies. If you don’t act as soon as possible, you don’t know if you will... Suddenly, Lev’s brain Flash, I think of Erna and Behan, who should go to the other side, they don’t know what to do. If they are fighting ahead, they should not suffer, but now they are not fighting in front. If they do, they are likely to be attacked by enemies hiding in the dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lev re-indented the body into a cover cloth, turned it into a rock, and began to slowly move in the other direction. In the middle of the torch, the two people played faster and faster. Although Raquel had an advantage on the surface, his breathing had begun to become cloudy and he began to show signs of exhaustion. He has a light sword in his hand, but he wants to keep up with the rhythm of Wei. He must also accelerate his movements to the limit, and in order to cover up the real purpose, he must make a lot of extra moves, so the physical consumption ratio He is expected to be still big. In contrast to him, Wei only did the most basic dodging action. At the same time, he grabbed the opponent's attack space and counterattacked a few times, so that the opponent did not dare to push too hard. His breathing was still stable and there was no disorder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Rachel’s eyes reveal a smile, because under his storm, Wei has approached his pre-set location, as long as With a boost, the victory is on the lookout. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A scream of human suffering has torn the surface of the darkness, and then the sound of a human body fracture, not knowing which bone, But definitely not only one is broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have a bunch of good partners! No chance to escape, but take the initiative to attack! It seems that you are very important to them!" Rachel stood still, Jianjianyao Refering to Wei's chest, he has already seen that Wei is only one meter away from the place he wants. With the opportunity to speak, he is trying to adjust his breathing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!...I don't understand why you are doing this. If you want to take revenge for failure, you should face the challenge, you do it, even if It didn't make sense to kill me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei’s words made Rachel a glimpse, but he immediately woke up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't matter! This time I bring in cronies! And, I killed you in a one-on-one battle? Is it not? And, as long as others believe that I am victorious in a fair duel, as for the facts, I believe that the dead will not speak!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello Just as sure to kill me... Just rely on the sword?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't think it will be great, I am the same! I also know the vindictive In the righteousness, vindictiveness can dispel the ordinary elves, but it is impossible to separate the elves that have been fused with the weapons in a short time. In the gap between the first wave of vindictiveness and the second wave (although it is very short), the power of magic still works! You can't protect you from vindictiveness! Let's die!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lakell flutters, the long sword slams over, and the forced Wei can only step back and step into the other side. The scheduled location. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behan also covered the cloth, but because of his armor And the sword that seemed too long, so the cover of the cloth was reduced to a minimum, but even so, he was not attacked by any accident. Similarly, he could not find any sneak attacker. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dark, human vision is reduced to a minimum, and the distance that can be seen is limited. In fact, it is now almost entirely based on hearing to judge the existence of the enemy. Fortunately, because of the long-term wear of Behan's armor, the joint contact parts have been smoothed, so there is no disgusting sound in this action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behan shorted his body and then quickly moved in the direction of the sound. An unusually crisp fracture broke into his ear at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s Elna, and finally comes to the sight of the line, the white figure does not need to know who it is, four or five bodies are entangled with her. The darkness is so thick, the weapons in the hands of those guys seem to be lightning, and they are swiping in the dark. Although the attack was on the enemy, it is obvious that the attacker is now a therapist who does not cover his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A body rushed up and hugged Erna from behind, but the guy immediately paid the price for this move, an elbow hit his ribs A series of blasting sounds were issued, and if the broken bone penetrated the internal organs, he would never want to move again. But this guy is very stubborn and does not let go. If only one-on-one is better, but the enemy is more than this one, because of this guy dragging, Erna lost the opportunity to dodge the other two guys to attack. The two men attacked the shoulders and attacked the shoulders. Obviously they did not intend to kill the enemy. They have discovered that this enemy is a woman, and intends to take Erna oysters to life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation crisis, although Behan knows that Elna’s defensive ability prevents her from being harmed by the general, but if they pierce the weapon and do not pull it out, No matter what kind of treatment is useless, it is no longer able to move forward with this slow speed. Behan throws away the piece of cloth that covers the body and runs at full speed. Although he is also a veteran warrior, at this time he has forgotten that there may be enemies hiding in the dark. After all, there are only four or five who fought and played for Elna. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behan in the flight suddenly became a soft foot, his body was uncontrollably planted on the ground, and he only saw it when he fell to the ground. Arrow feathers on the thighs. Because when he abandoned the cloth that covered his body, a bow in the darkness was aimed at him. Fortunately, it is difficult to aim at the upper body of a close enemy in a lying position, so just an arrow shot through his left leg. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle over there also broke the victory, and Erna hit the elbow again, letting the guy behind him slammed back to the ground, but the other two The guy's weapon has been deeply buried in her body, two very good fit, the position of the attack is perfect, a sword stabbed into the shoulder joint, and another stabbed into the knee joint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two successful people let go of the weapon and jump off, so as not to be countered. The women’s punching power has already been seen. At the same time as they retired, a sledgehammer rushed to Elna, and Elna, who had only one hand, could not dodge this attack, which was not desirable except for strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hammer and Erna’s right hand collided in front, and the broken horse was uploaded. The white body was hit by a powerful impact and fell off. There is no more movement on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ahhhhhhhh..." Behan, who watched this scene, screamed, although the injury in his leg made him unable to stand up, but he still The sword of the earth can be inserted into the ground. He can't see the archer who is hiding in the dark, but the guy who sneaked on Elna with a big hammer can't escape his anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The energy spurted out of the ground, and the whole guy flew to the sky, and when it fell, it was still motionless. The second arrow was shot again from the bowstring, this time not aligned with Behan's leg. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Swordsman finally fell down and showed the arrow outside his body Yu is still shaking, even if he can't kill him, it is enough to make him lose his fighting power. The winners can safely clean up everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s amazing, this stinky girl actually knocked her down three!" A guy wearing a black suit with a bow in his hand from the distance Behan was less than ten meters away and stood up. This black dress was his shadow. He buried half of his body in the sand dunes and easily solved Behan. However, half of this is Behan's own fault. If he does not throw away the covered cloth, then the darkness also affects the enemy's line of sight, so that he can't accurately aim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sneak attackers also paid a price for this victory, although in a sense they have kept the casualties to a minimum, but they have been defeated four times. One. Even with the advantage of a sneak attack, it is one of the biggest mistakes to fight with a boxing fighter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guy in black clothes looked at him with a loud voice, just like he was a hunter and the others were bait, now he is a bait, There is another adventurer, although I don't know how strong, but from his difficult companions, the guy is definitely not good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a strange bondage in the ground, and Wei’s feet were suddenly pulled. The power was so great that his feet moved. No, his opponent looked at it all, and his face showed a triumphant smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it magic?" Wei Meng’s spurt, although his opponent also violently counteracted the attack, but this did not let Lakai Indiscriminate attack. What surprised Wei was that the bondage at his feet remained the same and he could not break free. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lakell laughed, and he clearly saw that Wei tried to move his legs, but there was no way to move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Abandon it, kid, that is not a magic trap, it is a net of sand spiders! As long as you step on it, there is no way to break free. It's as strong as a steel wire, and it will automatically entangle itself when it hits the object on it - there is no other way to solve it except to burn it with flames, even the vindictiveness! The last time I met the sand spider here. Let my team lose four talents to solve it! However, I didn't think that its network could be used... It was the right choice without burning!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei stopped struggling, and Rakael said it should not be a lie. Although Wei has long seen that there must be some traps in it, I have always taken it for granted as a magic trap. As long as it is magic, I can deal with it, but I don’t think that the other party is coming. Dodge the guy's attack? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In order to win, have you completely lost your mind? You should have been trained in strict formality, why did you fall into this..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are calmly thinking about getting away from the game while catching the enemy with words. Generally speaking, when a person determines his own victory, he will not rush to kill his opponent. He will be like a cat and a mouse, and the opponent will be frustrated and then started. Wei now needs time to deal with this trap. As long as this trap can be broken, the roles of cats and mice will be changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unscrupulous? Right! I have learned to do anything now!" Rakker laughed. "What about that? I am now a bandit, not a knight." For the sake of victory, it is a matter of course! For your sake, my men have begun to shake, but it doesn't matter. When I take your head back, everything will return to normal! Because I have beaten you. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"By relying on this trap? What is the significance of this victory! Even if all else does not know, can you lie to yourself?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kid, some things you will never understand, let me give you a piece of advice before you die! Don't think that martial arts can do anything! Really powerful The people are those who open their mouths and let hundreds of thousands of people die. They can control human beings, not swords, but money and power! The only thing that can control money and power is wisdom! The sword can deal with it at most. It’s one or two hundred people! Ok, The time for the words is over, let's die!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rakel slashed the sword and cried to Wei, who could not dodge. Because of the difference in the length of the weapon, the distance is now The Demon Sword can't attack him, but his fine sword can be cut to Wei. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black people looked around and the rest of the adventurers still didn't appear. The three people exposed, he and the other two who had previously fought with Elna - the other two were looking at the injured companion - were not showing signs of attack, but that didn't explain anything, maybe the adventurer was hiding. In the deepest shadow, like a beast, ready to pounce on his prey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that something must be done to determine if the guy is hiding there. After all, it is possible for the enemy to escape. With this in mind, the black man went to Behan, who fell to the ground. He just shot this arrow from Behan's side ribs, and the shot was very deep. It must have been deep and visceral. Otherwise, there would be no way to let Behan move. When he passed, he did not notice a large stone in the shadow of the dunes. Because it is close to the edge of the desert, the big stone is not a rare thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not saved!" There was a voice over there, and a bandit had declared the end of the companion who was defeated by the power of the sword of the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The wicked boy!" The black man took the sword of the earth from Behan's hand. He already saw that the adventurer just passed out and still not dead. Although he made a position to stab, his attention focused on the surrounding things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lev was hiding in his camouflage cloth, and another knife was in his hand. It’s really a last resort. Otherwise, Behan will die. Lev can be sure that the guy who just used it will not hesitate to stab the sword. Now, even the most benzene enemy has already known his existence. The question below is whether he can find out his existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leif knows his strength, what he is good at is completely different from his companions, who knows that there are still several enemies hiding in the dark, maybe More than the number of flying knives in his hand. The only thing that can protect Lev is the darkness and the camouflage on his body, but there is a dangerous magician in the middle of the enemy. He may be able to find the thief from the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If gold is just fine!" Lev thought so, but the magician is now still undergoing rigorous training of the Necromancer on Undead Island, if Kim Here, everyone will be able to give the sneak attack a sly lesson, but the careless magician may become the first victim. When he thought of the magician, Lev involuntarily shrank his body. What he feared most was seen by the enemy's magician. Although he would like to leave this position, when all the enemy's attention (including the magician) is concentrated here, a less noticeable movement of the stone will not be able to escape their sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guy who just announced his companion’s death came over here, and the cat was waisted and cautious. Seeing his actions, Lev was overjoyed—it seems that the enemy's magician did not have the illusion of wisdom. Otherwise, Lev had already become an archery target. Where else would a guy come to test? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief let the enemy pass by, without attack, the guy’s attention was concentrated around Behan’s side, and no attention was paid to the stone. Then, just as he knelt down to see the cause of his companion's death, there was also a knife handle on his neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a dangerous gamble, Lev bet the magician did not see his movements, or his magic is not proficient, or his vision is not sharp enough. If everything is set according to the thief's setting, all the enemies will not pay more attention to the stone, and set the position of the imaginary enemy on the other side of the three non-moving bodies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leif triumphed, as long as there is no magic and bow and arrow to call him, it proves that his gambling has been won, the enemy’s actions immediately stopped, The husband presses the ecstasy of his heart, concentrates all his attention on the ears, and probes every possible useful information from the vibration of the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one silence in the darkness, the only thing in the distant fire The fighting sounds came from time to time. All people are hiding in the darkness, almost integrated into the darkness. This is a contest of endurance. Whoever moves first will become a prey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But time is not good for Lev, because his two companions, even if they are not in danger now, will wait until they are not treated. I must think of a way to destroy the enemy as soon as possible. Even so, the thief did not make any ruthless moves, because he knew a bad word, don't say save people, he must be saved by others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a continuation, and when Leif began to feel a little anxious, he heard a slight sound of sand moving in his ear - his opponent pressed I can't stand it and start acting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alna’s consciousness woke up from a coma and then immediately felt That almost caused her to immediately return to the coma. As a therapist, she knows the structure of the person's body very clearly. From the different feelings that I have uploaded from my body, I can roughly know what kind of harm I have suffered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two weapons pierce the left shoulder and the right knee, while disintegrating the mobility of the two limbs, especially the left shoulder, the sword - I don't know It's not a sword, but it must be a weapon. The thorn is so deep that the shoulders are almost detached. If you don't pull it out as soon as possible, this arm will probably be abolished. The bone of the right hand is completely broken in the frontal collision with the hammer. The whole hand can't move like mud. Even if there is healing, it is definitely not a day or two to recover from this level of damage. . Like these limbs, the chest is also greatly damaged in the previous attack. Even if the sacrifice of the right hand is used as a buffer, the bones must be hurt. Every slightest breath gives the chest unbearable pain. Erna soon realized that her current injury made her unable to move, even if she had been treated for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it dead?" Elna spoke with a voice she could only hear, but even so, the chest still had a tearing sensation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a strange feeling came to my mind, and the journey after leaving the temple became vaguely blurred in my mind, as if it were a dream. A dream that never happened before. Everything changed so unreal, and Behan’s embarrassment, met Wei at the dock, met Kim, Lev and Babe before the contest, then miraculously won, then met the old Locke... half The Orc... The Dragon... The Necromancer... Everything in the past is reflected in the scene of the mind, and then the pain is pressed to drive everything away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alna slightly tilted her head, although it was slightly twisted when she fell, but the neck did not matter, of course, the impact on the chest It’s impossible to look up too high, and what I can see around seems to prove my thoughts—the body of the guy who attacked him with a hammer, because the big hammer was next to the body. Everything shows that there was another battle after he was in a coma. Since he was lying here and ignored, the ending of the battle can be imagined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you lie down like this, you will definitely die, because the weapon is not pulled out of the body, the wound can not heal, and the bones of the right hand and chest are again It is impossible to heal quickly. The bones of the right hand are probably shattered. It is impossible to pull out the two damn weapons on their own. When their power is exhausted, it is their own death, and under the pain of torture, I may not be able to drag on for so long. By the way, why are the guys not taking their weapons away? Maybe they are also dead, and they died in the hands of Lev or Behan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don't want to die, using that power seems to be the only choice! It’s a bit ironic. Although I don’t want to use that kind of inhuman power, I’m traveling to prove that I don’t rely on that kind of power, but I can only rely on it at the most critical time. If I don’t have this power, I am afraid that I was already dead at the contest. If I was not controlled by the will and was for others when I saved Lev, then there is no reason to shirk it. If you don’t use it, you will Silent death in this place that no one knows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alna gently exhaled a breath, she clearly understood how strong her desire to survive, she did not want to die like this from the deepest part of her heart Here, just dying in a battle that no one knows, it was buried in the sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therapist concentrates and prepares to start her special prayer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leif suppresses his nervous heart and captures it with his ears Staying in the rustling sound that is slightly to the limit, the sound is near, close, ... very close... just to the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A black figure is crawling slowly, his eyes are staring at the front, and he climbs over the rock just to cover it with the shadow of the rock. I didn’t care about the big stone itself, so I didn’t notice a hand suddenly protruding from the stone when I climbed over the rock. I held a short sword on the handle and started. Before the action, it was deliberately made a dark dagger in some way. The hand was lifted and swiftly smashed from the cervical joint position on the neck of the unsuspecting victim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leif retracted the shorts, if it wasn’t for this guy who chose to climb over him, he might not have had a chance to find this sly guy, but the sinner chose the wrong one. The route was self-seeking, and Lev did not feel any embarrassment for the act of just doing the same as the assassination. He knows that there is no need to worry now, this guy is so secretive, even his companions must be unable to grasp his actions, and now it is safe - it is safe before the next guy climbs over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What should I do next? Waiting here? No, you must take the initiative to attack, otherwise, if you drag it down, Elna and Behan may not be saved. By the way, you can make full use of this corpse... There is a sudden glimmer of light in the darkness, which is particularly eye-catching at this unusual moment. Lev sees the direction of the light source from the inside of the gap with one eye. In fact, Now all the people hiding in the dark are looking in the direction of the light source. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light is emitted from the body of Elna. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The therapist raised his right hand and pulled out the short thorn that pierced his shoulder deeply, then the sword on the knee, she casually Throw these weapons aside and stand up. The light was even stronger after she stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there seems to be a force guarding the side of this glowing body. All the arrows are harmlessly landing in front of her body. Alna, standing there, glanced at the arrows that flew over and then to one of them. Going to the source. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leif’s heart almost jumped out of the blind eye, and then returned to the original place after seeing that all the bows and arrows were invalid for Elna. Although he did not know what happened, it seems that the situation has reversed and it is a complete reversal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The archer in the dark stood up, but didn’t seem to want to escape, he threw the bow, pulled a bright dagger from the waist and greeted the love Erna greeted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come on, stinky!" 骂 骂 while cursing and rushing up, a knife spurs the belly of this glowing woman. But his opponent grabbed his wrist, and then, in everyone's eyes - including Lev - the wrist caught in the hand of Elna suddenly disappeared! It was not broken or cut, but it disappeared in the hands of Elna - the wrist part suddenly disappeared, and Lev clearly saw that the hand holding the dagger fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cockroach stepped back and then sat down on the ground. He looked at his arm with unbelievable eyes, and the blood on his arm was broken. No, it seems that it has not been interrupted by the other party, but it has been broken for several years. The whole wound is perfectly combined, and it has been the same as those that have existed for many years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he removed his gaze from his arm, Elna was already standing in front of him, and the light from the woman seemed to be stronger. So that this cockroach can't be opposite, he wants to turn around and escape, but it is too late. A glowing hand grabbed his throat and lifted his entire body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone has seen this scene and clearly sees that body is How to dry and decay in the indescribable speed of this woman's hand, the kind of light that Elna's body emits seems to be sucking the life of this victim in her hand. Her hand is pinching the throat of this bandit and let him Unable to break free and unable to act, the two kept this unmoving posture until the bandit was completely eroded, and then the whole body was grayed out, and the light of the light of Elna’s body faded with the wind, leaving only A dress proves that this person has ever existed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Quiet...monster!" Lev heard the sound coming from a dark corner, and a body that looked a little panicked jumped. This situation made these countless killing bandits begin to feel scared. This seemingly over-spirited guy put an arrow at the glowing body, but this arrow fell in harmlessly just before it was close. On the ground, this wrong move just let Erna notice the existence of this guy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alna went to the guy, and Lev saw a person who was quite close to himself - to be honest, if not him When he got up, there was no way to find out. He was lying on the other side of the sand dune from Lev. - There was a word in the mouth of the bandit. Then, a dazzling thunderbolt was released from the guy’s finger and rushed to Ayr. Na's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This person is the magician in the gangster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We spurt vindictive again, but his opponents have precautions for this - - This is also the only thing he deserves to guard against - he judged Wei's next move from Wei's move, so he jumped back one step at a time. Although Wei's vindictiveness was strong, his opponent's correct approach made him not How much damage was received - it was only blown away for four or five meters and immediately rushed back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come on, see how many vindictives can you use?" Rake smirked and approached again, although it was blocked, but it didn't matter, the advantage remained. It is very obvious, this is just the last time the beast in the trap struggled - maybe still struggling a few times, but still can not get rid of the fate of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei Wei is struggling with this gap, but only separates his legs by about two centimeters, and immediately bounces back in the gap of force. The sand spider's net is not only strong, but also elastic, it is really something that can't be broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What should I do? Looking at Rachel, who is getting closer and closer, Wei understands that it is impossible to win with vindictiveness alone, and that vindictiveness can only delay a little more time. Once exhaustion is exhausted, his own end will come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life and death are here, Wei bites his teeth, he has made up his mind, and instead of being exhausted after being exhausted, it is better to beat. He raised his sword and made a stance to fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning accurately hits Erna’s body, but this glow The woman didn't seem to have any reaction. It was like she didn't hit it. She didn't even pause for this thunder. She continued to approach the guy who was trying to catch the second arrow. The latter couldn't finish because of panic. Lisuo can do the work. After looking up to see the distance between the two people, the bandit simply threw the bow and pulled out a sword. His face was completely distorted by fear, but he did not escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What monster are you?" He shouted like this, and he waved his sword indiscriminately, even though his opponent had not yet entered the sword's attack range. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...fools!..." Erna made her voice for the first time, and Lev heard it very clearly. It was definitely not the voice of Elna. The sound is empty and distant, as if it was not from the body, but from a very distant place, but only through this body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I was shocked by this accident, Lev made a correct move after replying, and everyone’s attention was focused on Elna. The physical opportunity, he threw a knife again - aimed at the neck of the magician who was reading the second spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...汝If you admire life, you should not choose this path of killing... The opposite of life is dead..." In this voice, love Erna defeated the guy who was originally a random resistance. He grasped his hand with the sword and the other hand pinched his throat - just like the one just above. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alna turned and walked to another guy, ignoring the magician who made the last convulsion on the ground, and her new goal also knew she couldn’t hide. Now, just jump up and pull out the weapon. At this time, the morale of the robbers has actually collapsed completely. The monsters that are invulnerable are unable to deal with them, but they have not escaped because they know that this will lead to the punishment of the leader. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The robber clasped his weapon and prepared to fight until a scream came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a creepy scream in the distance, the last scream of humanity before death, that was the voice of Raquel! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadows hiding in the darkness almost jumped up and fled in different directions, including the one facing Elna. The total number is about twenty. The number is more than the unexpected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laquel looked at his huge abdomen wound with unbelievable eyes His abdomen blew a huge blood hole and the internal organs all flowed outward. Even the attack that had just used the vindictiveness to counteract the opponent's attack was useless. The concentrated temperament horribly tore his body and caused this terrible wound in his abdomen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is impossible! Raquel once again screamed, seeming to prove that he could have become the world's first tenor. It was a painful scream, but now it is full of resentment and resentment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is this possible? The powerful enemy has fallen into his trap. It has become a beast that has been driven into a cage. Only when he is dead, he has already won the victory, but why is there a wound on his body instead of The guy in front of me, everything is like an incredible reversal, being defeated, being knocked down is actually himself, is the perfect trap and let the other person step on himself? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rakel also clearly remembered the attack he had just launched. He saw from the other’s eyes that the opponent wanted to fight, so he was very careful. A knife was thrown, and his opponent also waved a sword - although his sword could not touch Rachel's body at this distance. As expected, the opponent did not throw the sword, but threw the sword and threw the sword at himself. He wanted to use this accidental surprise to knock down himself, but he had already prepared for this, so he made a dodge in time. Very thrilling to let the sword wipe past the side of his ear! This has already been victorious, but who thought that the opponent's left hand had made an attack at this time - the hand was aimed at the self-defeating state because of the dodge flying sword, and then... he also made a grudge, two shares The grudges violently collided with each other, and then... this huge, deadly wound appeared on their stomach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Damn!" Rake gave the last scream, full of desire for life and unwillingness to die. He glared at Wei's eyes almost without bleeding. This eye told Wei. What his opponent is saying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even if you die, I want you to put a coffin back!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this is enough Unstoppable, deadly wounds, but Raquel broke out of Superman's tenacity. He made an incredible step forward, waved a sword, cut to the empty hands, and could not dodge Wei. Even the vindictiveness that Wei once again spurted could not stop this sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second...the third...every time from there The throat that echoes in the open desert makes the people who flee around speed up. Everyone here can judge from this series of voices which winners of the duel are there. The leader is dead - even if it is not dead now, it is definitely a very fast thing, they have no need to fight this terrible monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The God of the Night wraps everything with a benevolent chest, protects the escaped man with his black cloak, escapes the gaze of the stalker, In two minutes, there were only two living men, Lev and Elna, and a seriously wounded swordsman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leif opened the piece of cloth that had been protecting him and stood up. He had wanted to hide for a while, but he noticed that Elna - - I don't know if it is Elna, maybe something is attached to her - my eyes are on him, and he knows that the other person has long known about his existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alna came over, and the light on his body did not weaken. When she approached, Lev discovered that he could not judge the source of this light. Although it seems that this light is emitted from the body of Elna, her body does not appear to be translucent because of its radiance. Her face and clothes look very bright. - She is illuminated by light, not by light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lev Brana understood, not Elna shines, but a group of light surrounds Elna. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alna came to Lev, who was nervous because of the tension, his hand holding the sword (he did not have a scabbard for light) . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for taking care of this child!" Erna walked to Lev, snoring gently, her voice and what she just heard. The same, but because of the proximity, Lev can now judge, this is the voice of an old woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are..." Although it was just a sentence, Lev knew that the other party was not malicious to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that these robbers are gone, in fact, I can't hold on for too long! Please don't tell this child that her hand has been contaminated with the blood of human life. It's what I did, it has nothing to do with her! It's best not to tell her what happened, please promise me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I promised...but..." Before she finished, the light on Elna’s body suddenly disappeared, and then her body fell down and fell in Lev’s arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thin sword was finally cut to Wei’s body, more precisely It is said that it was cut into Wei’s black armor, and the thin sword was placed on the armor. As expected, this thick sword could not open the thick body armor, but this The sword does not hurt people by the edge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The energy of the thunderbolt came out from the sword and passed through the armor to the swordsman. In an instant, the blue light surrounded Wei’s The body, quickly turned into a shining white light, thunder and lightning in every cell of Wei's body, let this human feel the pain of unprecedented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the sword-bearer has virtually no strength, after cutting the last knives in his life, he has been very reluctant to stand still, but He can still stick the sword on the opponent's armor, so that Wei can't get rid of this huge pain. The body is constantly twitching, and the limbs are out of control. There is only a blank left in Wei’s mind. Except for pain and pain, for those who are being attacked by lightning, time becomes eternal--painful. Eternal, in fact, this situation only lasted for four to five seconds, but it was enough for the sentenced person to feel as long as the first century. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The bandits have already left, and there are no other people besides him who are conscious (except for Wei, who is too far apart). The bandits have now escaped, even if there are still some seriously wounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, Behan!" Lev immediately remembered his companion who was seriously injured and comatose. The first thing to do is to bandage him and wait for love. After Erna woke up, he was given further treatment... Yes, Elna has nothing to do? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is quite black, but I can’t talk about the point where I can’t reach my fingers. For a veteran like Lev, I have to see the scope of the five or six steps. There is no problem, let alone Erna lying in his arms - there is no scar on Elna's body, no wounds or bruises, let alone blood and things, except The clothes looked a bit dirty, and Lev was relieved, but he quickly realized that the woman in her arms was Elna, whom she could not reach. Although I have done it many times in my dreams, in the real world, Lev is still holding this woman in her arms for the first time. The tall nose, the slender eyebrows, the delicate and smooth skin, the rosy lips that always keep the sweet smile... More importantly, her exquisite body is in her arms at the moment. This understanding made the poor thief's mind blank. He was holding the therapist motionless, as if holding a fragile dream. Time seems to be stagnant. Lev’s eyes were always staring at Erna, as if she had blinked, she would disappear. In order to see her more clearly, Lev put his eyes a little closer, and finally his lips replaced his eyes and fell on Elna's lips, noticing that Elna slightly opened half of the eyes immediately Closed again... When Leif realized what he had done, his face was hot. He is a little overwhelmed. The poor thief was so calm, but from the physical condition of the therapist and her uniform breathing, she was still in a coma, and he quickly put Erna on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then ran to the unconscious companion. Lev’s face was still hot, and his heart was full of the kind of excitement and joy that mixed with guilt. He was surprised to find that his hands and feet were so agile, and he handled the unscrupulous swordsman's wounds with his own speed. He dug out two arrows that pierced the body and then used one of his own powders. (Old Locke taught) Preliminary treatment of Behan's injury, and finally wrapped in a bandage. Although I can't expect this to make Behan wake up immediately, but at least let him die - it should be fortunate, because the arrow first penetrated the armor and then stabbed into the body, so the damage is less than expected. Although it is already very serious. The biggest danger of Behan is that a lot of blood is flowing, but now it has stopped, there should be nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, Wei doesn’t know how! Although Lev had already heard screams from there and judged that Wei had won, but did not know if he was injured or not, he needed to help. He should look at it first. Those bandits should not come back. There should be no problem for individuals to lie here...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forget it! Lev finally sat down in the same place. He was very confident in his powerful companion. Together with the message from the voice, everything is enough to prove that Wei has won. He must now find himself everywhere. These three people, it is better to wait here, so as not to cause any accidents, not afraid of 10,000, just be afraid. Lev did not think that Wei and Raquel fell to the ground together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am still not dead?" When Wei Wei opened his eyes, this first thought appeared in the mind, at the moment of falling, in the sword The moment he slipped from his body, he thought he was dead. This was the only thought in his mind when he fell down. When a person loses control of the whole body, leaving only a faint conscious, death is probably the only ending he can think of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not dead yet!" Everything is ok, the eyes are still seeing the desert under the torch, and now they are lying on the ground, at night The sand sent a cold feeling through the armor, and Wei moved his eyes down and saw the body in the field of vision. Raquel, the bandit leader who set the trap to find him to fight, has become a cold, unconscious body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body is abnormally weak, and the strength has already left the body, but Wei still struggles to climb up. He first felt that the physical armor was so heavy. When he barely stood up, Wei Cai discovered his armor. The whole body that the elder dragon gave him had turned from black to blue, just like Rakker’s sword was swiping in the air. The kind of blue residue left behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
