As the old Locke put the potion on his body, those places immediately grew out of the body hair that looked quite rigid. As the potion gradually filled his arms, face, neck and all other exposed places, Old Locke became a half-orc, a rather small old orc. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, it's up to you!" Old Locke was ready, and he turned his face to the astonished gold that couldn't close his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This... What is this all about?" Gold stammered and pointed at the old Locke’s body, which was now all hairy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is of course a disguise! Do you think that the half-orcs will let us come to their sites safely? Well, let's get started!" Locke took out a piece of clothing from the bag. "Handle your wound first, then put on this dress!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything is in order, the gold on the body is wearing a half-orc handmade clothing, the injured hand is wrapped up and wrapped around the neck with a belt, if not take off the clothes If you drop it, anyone will regard him as a wounded soldier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold caressing the "hair" on one's body. In fact, this is not a hair, it is just something like a fungus. Old Locke's creamy syrup is applied to the skin, and the fungus grows out of the thin coating. Although this layer of paste-like stuff is quite firm and sticky to the skin, it can be dropped by hand with a few twists and turns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What the hell is this?" Kim couldn't help but ask the old Locke who was packing things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Used the purple powder and the roots of the mandala! It is a perfect match for the half-orcs!" Do not lift the answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This...this is really amazing! Medicine has this magical effect! It's almost like magic!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Young people!" Old Locke had packed the bag at this time, and he threw the bag on his shoulder. "Pharmaceuticals are a branch of magic!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pharmaceutical? The branch of magic????"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes! You have to know, anything in this world. There is magical power, and medicine is a technique that triggers the magical power contained in plants! So it can also be a branch of magic! Although it does not have obvious power like a mantra, it can also Play a big role in certain conditions! Don't say, we have to start right away and meet other people!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people are in their own A scarf around his neck covered his mouth completely different from the half-orc and began to walk down the hill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two humans swayed into the city they had just squandered, and although Kim’s heart was very upset, Old Locke told him Just follow him without saying anything, and other things are naturally solved by him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-orcs who are looking for humans in the city have not expressed any doubts about the two orcs who "take this victory from afar." Old Locke didn't even use the injury that was prepared to explain the injury on Kim. They easily passed through the already martial-stricken city and walked out of the gate under the eyes of a large number of heavily armed half-orcs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really is a good risk!" After leaving the sights of the half-orc soldiers of the defenders, Kim found that his body was soaked with cold sweat. It is. At this time, the old Locke who walked in front (the baby was put in his pocket) had unscrupulously took out a bottle of drunken wine that had just been taken from the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!" Old Locke sprayed all the wine out. “I used to think that the technology of the half-orcs was too bad. I didn’t think of it for so many years. It’s still so bad, even worse than before! Their bad crops can’t be used for winemaking at all!”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Locke..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Have you been here before?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, I have lived for so many years, where have I not been? I am a food, wine, beauty seeker, As long as there is any one of these three things, I have been there! You don't look at the vulgar and brutal like the Orcs, but they actually have a few dishes to do very well! I found a city in the city that year. I have been living here for three years, and I have stayed here for three years. I have enough to eat before I leave!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I used to think that the old Locke mystery, now Kim I think he is simply amazing. A human has lived in a half-orc city for three years! ! ! And not seen! This sentence is an inspiration, and Kim finally said what he always wanted to say (since the old Locke taught him to use the "Thunderbolt", this thought has always existed in his mind). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Locke! Can you accept me as a disciple, teach me magic?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Accepting you as a disciple? I don't think it is necessary. You have a very good teacher. Although the teachings of the disciples are not comprehensive enough! But the skills of magic use, I can teach you a little!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know my teacher?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, but I can see it from you. You can put a twenty-something It’s not easy for a young person to be a great magician! Your teacher’s only mistake is not letting you do actual combat training. It seems that you are his first student! He has no experience in teaching students!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Combat training? Yes! I will conduct a practical drill every once in a while!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The object of the battle during actual training is your teacher or what magic puppet he made?” Old Locke laughed. “You have never experienced real combat training. So you only know that 'pure battle' does not know that victory is the principle of all. Your teacher's training only allows you to know how to fight the magician, so once you meet the half-orc, even half of the strength can not play. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I! Can I play more power?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course! Let me teach you some wisdom of age! Although I was expelled from the School of Magic, I can still teach you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold knows Old Locke It is absolutely impossible to be a person who was expelled from the Magic Academy as he said, but he also knows that Old Locke would not reveal his true identity. He must know why he still doesn’t ask too much in this regard. it is good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two people talked while walking, and they have gone a long way without knowing it. At this moment they can’t see the shadow of Cyril City. They can't see the shadow of any creature in sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It should be nearby." Old Locke muttered, he looked around, but saw nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Locke, what are you looking for?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course other people, I I’m going to wait for me here!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold is also a little anxious, he also began to look around carefully, but this band only has yellow grass, other Nothing at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here!" A voice suddenly passed over. A man dressed in the same color as the surrounding grass stands up and greets the two. At this time, Lev discovered that the two half-orcs were Kim and Old Locke. Lev is indeed a talent for thieves, and his camouflage skills are first class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leif!" After experiencing so many things, I can still see my partner. Kim feels that something in his heart has come up all the time, even though he Hard to suppress, but the tears of joy have already appeared on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that both of them are coming back safely, Lev is also very excited at this moment, he rushes up, hardly embraces the magician, even the stout gold Being caught is not mad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, okay! Go and meet other people!" Old Locke stopped the scene of this exciting reunion, Lev Think of his duties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Levi excitedly told Jin about the experience of breaking up when he walked to the hiding place of his partners. After Elna was taken away, three people (baby not counting) passed through the Orc Wilderness under the leadership of Old Locke. Old Locke used his cosmetic potion to dress everyone into a half-orc, and easily mixed into the city of Cyril. Then, at the prisoners' auction, everyone sold Elna (Leif's bleeding) at a big price, but they didn't see the other two partners until the auction ended. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When others were desperate, Old Locke suggested that Kim and Wei might have been taken to the arena. Somehow, Old Locke got the job of giving the gladiator a meal from the hands of a half-orc. He used his identity to detect that two people were indeed in the dungeon of the arena, and arranged a rescue plan<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's there!" Lev pointed to a dense grove and said to Kim. After he finished speaking, they also went to other people's hiding places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s really like the feeling of being separated from the world. When Kim re-visits his partner, he even wonders if he is dreaming in the cell of the half-orc. The familiar words and kind expressions of the home are used to welcome the return of the magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are finally back, the magician brother!" Babe jumped over and hugged the gold neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's okay! Kim!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's back, great!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only Wei lying on the ground did not say, but this is not his unwillingness, but not! Now that his whole body is bandaged, he has no way to use gestures. Elna has done everything she can to treat him, but her current strength is too weak (the sequela of the reincarnation), and Wei's injury is too heavy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, everyone will leave soon! We must leave the Orc's site with the fastest speed. As long as we reach the half-orc wilderness, we are not in danger! "After listening to the old Locke, everyone got up and prepared." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 02<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When everyone is ready, they are leaving (they I made a stretcher and put Wei, which can't move, on it.) Old Locke grabbed the baby who was sleeping from his bag—of course, grabbed the gem and gave it to Babe. "Take care of him! Babe. He really played the biggest role today!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, no one understands the meaning of old Locke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Four days of trekking, relying on their disguise, seven people did not encounter any obstacles, and smoothly entered the half-orc wilderness after a large circle . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team is now led by the old Locke, and the rapid advancement of these days has added a mysterious veil to the old man. Now Kim noticed the amazing physical strength of the old Locke. Although he always complains that he is uncomfortable here, there is a lot of cramps there, but when other people are tired because they have been on the road for a long time, only he is still full of energy, and he is still starting to get as fast as he walks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's true! The young people now... Really... can't eat bitter at all!" This sentence is the oldest that Locke said most these days. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now everyone doesn’t have to run as fast, the Orc Wilderness is no longer a land that the Orcs can completely control, and the route chosen by Old Locke can They don't have to worry about what other chasing soldiers are catching up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night falls, the adventurers have a bonfire in the camp, this For the first time in many days, they can sleep peacefully without worrying about accidents. Because they are completely safe now, they have no arrangements for the sentry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold lies in the tent, it should have been a night to let him rest and recover from fatigue, but at this moment he can't sleep. This is a very strange phenomenon. After a hard day's work, people will fall asleep more easily, but if they are too hard, they will be excited and unable to sleep at night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behan, who is lying around, has been sleeping very deeply. Although Jin tried hard to make himself fall asleep, this kind of effort can only be counterproductive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A vague voice came over, as if someone was chanting poetry. Kim looked in the direction of the sound, and a person was sitting next to the campfire at the moment, and it seems that some people can't sleep like him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold slowly approached, now he can see who it is, sitting in front of the fire is the old Locke. At this point, the old Locke is sitting in front of the flame, holding a long-looking thing in his hand, that is Wei's magic sword! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...the old disaster has just passed, the new disaster has come to earth, and the family with the will to destroy has come to this world...death and destruction When it comes, life only waits for extinction in the helpless wailing..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Locke is slowly moping his demon sword in his hand While chanting with a voice that only a person who is meditating can make a speech, he seems to be carrying a poem, but this wonderful rhythm is something that Kim has never heard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Locke..." Kim said softly, but Old Locke was obviously shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's you..." It was gold that came behind him. Old Locke returned to normal. "Can't sleep? Don't stand, sit down!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold is sitting cross-legged at the side of the old Locke, just in the fire, Kim sees the old Locke’s expression and the feeling of being crazy and stupid is completely different. Old Locke revealed an indescribable majesty, and felt a little similar to Kim’s teacher. That is the kind of person who has mastered the most powerful power can give other feelings (but this expression does not last long, the old Locke quickly returned to the usual expression.)<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Locke, what did you just read?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a poem of the high fair, that is in my hands. The story of this sword, this story of 'fangs'!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This sword is called 'fangs'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, he is one of the three demon swords made by the high-level goblins, and the only one left!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Old Locke began to recite the poem "...the great Robinick, the greatest craftsman of the goblin family, with his own blood and life to cast weapons that can destroy the power of the gods; seven warriors who accept the destiny, Embarked on the journey to conquer the roots of darkness, with the glory of justice. In the unknown distant side, justice and evil fought in the wilderness. When the sun shines again At the time, the victory finally turned to the right side. Everyone can hear the last barking of the devil, but he is destined to perish... All life is cheering and singing, they are all looking forward to the justice of justice. But the warriors Their blood is full of exotic land, and no one can live back to their hometown..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold listens to the sound of old Locke, the old Locke is used One kind of reciting with a sad voice, but the content of this voice and poetry is very close, and Jin Xiang’s own self-seeing the fierce battle that both sides have endured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...the shattered family is no longer worthy of fear, the world is out of their clutches. People are commemorating the unknown warriors, they will be in the various races In my memory, I live forever and ever..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This seems to be a narrative poem!" When Old Locke finally finished, Kim spoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, it’s the story of the seven high-level goblins who defeated the devil, and this 'fang' is one of the weapons they use! Poetry is widely spread among the high-level goblins, but it is rarely heard in humans..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The devil? Is it a demon?" By the way, his curiosity has been motivated by the poetry of this higher goblin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can say this! You have also studied history. You know, a long time ago, the demon was a common threat to all races..." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes! All races at the time were united. After hundreds of years of war, this threat was finally eliminated! My teacher always told me this paragraph. History, he regrets why it is so thorough to destroy the demon. He always wanted to catch a demon to study, but now it is difficult to find the trace of the demon!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"...?????"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is because there is a demon king! The devil is a life directly created by the gods of three chaos. The devils created other demons, so once the demon king was knocked down, the demon family could not escape from extinction!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Locke stopped to look at the gold face Kim is listening to God, and what Old Locke said is something he has never heard of, so he is dubious at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Locke, you just said the devil's, aren't there more than one demon?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Yes, the three chaos gods each created a demon king. So there are three devils in total."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry...but...but Mr. Locke, you How do you know this? I am not suspicious of you, but I have never heard of these history, although I have a little understanding of history..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Old Locke laughed. "Young people! Do you know how many catastrophe in history have been for human civilization?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three times. The first time is liberation During the war, the war with the high spirits caused a lot of casualties, and many valuable knowledge was lost. The second time was the dynasty war. The use of the curse almost completely destroyed the human civilization, and the magic knowledge was back 1000 years. The third time is the Undead War, the complete destruction of the Necromancer and the great casualties in the war. Ming once again showed a retrogression. My teacher often told me that if there is no dynasty war, now the warriors, thieves and other professions have long left a historical noun in human society!" Jin said these things can be said to be Such as a few treasures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right! You think about it, when humans finally defeated the high-level goblins, are they likely to delete those parts that praise the merits of the high-level goblins? When it was the war of the dynasty, was there any possibility that many precious historical documents were destroyed in the war? Believe me, young people!" Old Locke can indeed be said to be quite powerful, he did not answer the gold "you Why do you know" but to distort this question into "Why don't I know." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Locke, can you tell me about that history?" Kim is not an idiot, he can also hear the old Locke. Since Old Locke didn't want to say it, he couldn't ask for it. He always had his reasons for doing so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course! You have heard of ancient wars! The appearance of the demon is just after the ancient war is completely over. After the end of the big melee, the races are zero. The shattered gods who had never created any life suddenly created three devils. Perhaps these three devils were created long ago, but in this They only started to be known by other races."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A large number of demons suddenly appeared in various places lost in the mainland, they have powerful power, and they kill and Blood is a pleasure. Many of the weaker races have been completely eliminated, and even those powerful races have been greatly threatened. In the constant battle with ordinary demons, everyone knows the existence of the devil!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All races ask God for help, but the gods can't do anything. As long as the demon exists, the demon is always a threat, and the demon is the direct creation of the god of chaos. Powerful, and no weapon or magic can give fatal damage to the demon. It is said that this is a compensation for the demon to have no way to reproduce. Maybe the god of chaos only wants to build three devils in the world, but they did not think of it. The devil can actually create a demon, and the power of the devil is beyond the limits of the gods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When the threat of the demon is growing The greatest craftsman of the high class, the great craftsman, Robnick, cast three evil swords in an unknown way. He also paid his life for this greatest achievement."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Locke gently touched the "fangs" in his hand at this time, and muttered with a voice that Kim could not hear. "I didn't think I had a chance to see it again." You!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Then..." Suddenly, Old Locke felt a cold snap spread throughout the body like electricity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned his head and said to the darkness with a cold voice: "Since it is here, what to hide, come out!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hehehehehe..." The laugh of the frog's cry that seemed to be inside the box came out of the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 03<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goldenly watched the direction of the sound, that is, the old Locke The direction the face is facing. A figure slowly appeared in the darkness, and it felt like this figure was originally part of this darkness, and it is now stripping out in the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a huge figure in a black cloak. This man was very tall and wrapped all over the cloak that could hold his body. In the darkness, a guy who revealed strange and dangerous suddenly appeared, and Kim immediately became nervous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hehehe... It’s amazing, I can feel that I exist, and the Gloria kid can’t catch you! Of course!” But his voice, like the scream of a frog inside the box, made his admiration full of harsh feelings. Two people sitting next to the campfire stood up, and Kim could clearly feel that the other party was not good, and he began to secretly prepare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is that the new king of teeth sent you? I think of it, the name of the king of teeth is called Geller!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Most correct, only a little wrong! He is 'please' me, not 'send' me. The kid was damaged because of the hammer of the god of war, fast Go crazy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The War of the Gods is broken? This is really not a good news! This is the status of the king of his teeth. "!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you will be disappointed, the hammer of the god of war is not as serious as the damage you think, just a slight damage, just pass a few The ceremony, the hammer will be repaired!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people made the first round of contests with words, the mysterious person on the surface (we temporarily call He is a mysterious person.) He revealed very important news to them, but in fact this news has no value at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who are you, don't hide your head, sneaky, what do you want to do?" Kim said that he was from this mysterious guy. I feel a feeling of dislike. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but at this moment the mysterious man and the old Locke have not paid attention to gold, their attention has been attracted to each other, both sides can clearly feel the strength of each other, No one dares to act rashly. This is not a judgment made by appearance or intuition, but two people can feel how powerful the other party is from a higher level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Locke’s hand seems to be inadvertently playing the sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The toy in your hand is really fun!" The mysterious man broke the silence again, "Where to find it!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not a toy! This is the only one left in the three, but one is enough!" Old Locke continued to play the magic sword with carelessness. On the surface, he is very leisurely and contentive, but only he himself knows how nervous his heart is at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mysterious man is hesitating, when Geller came to him, he felt a little curious: it was just a few humans, how to mobilize all the half The orcs can't catch it? So he decided to go to see and see. When he wants to come and deal with a few humans - no matter what kind of goods, human beings are human beings - there is absolutely no problem. But when he came here, he found that this creature with a human appearance possessed a huge force that he could not estimate. Moreover, in his hands, he had the only weapon he feared in the world. These two unestimated factors made him never dare to do it. He must now first test how much the other party knows. There is such a human being - he has no way to judge whether he is human or not, but at least his appearance is a human being - there is absolutely no reason for existence, he will Will not pose a threat? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold started to feel strange, this big noise (the sound is very harsh) enough to wake his partner, but until now, no one has come out tent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No need to watch, no one will wake up until dawn. You should thank me for letting them sleep well!" The eyes under the cloak, but Kim still felt the sharp eyes directly in his heart, he felt like he was standing on the ground, this feeling can not help but let him back a few steps, he retreated to the old Locke Behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hehehe... Don't say this! I just think that the half-orcs are too poor, always bullied by humans, so help them with compassion, so that they can bully and bully humans!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mysterious man carefully observed the old Locke in front, but he did not find anything from the face of Old Locke, and the old Locke was protected by a mysterious force, he could not directly observe each other's Inner world. He is used to fully inspecting the enemy and fighting, but the creature in front of him has no way to fully grasp it. There are too many unpredictable factors. The mysterious person decided to temporarily retreat. From the temptation just now, he already knew that the other party knew his plan, but only knew a small part. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two, it seems that I have been disturbing for too long today, I think I should say goodbye! Right, I forgot to introduce myself, others I am called "Supreme"! I believe we can meet again soon!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the old Locke and Kim answered, the figure of the Sayādaw is Their front dissolves into the darkness of the surroundings, and as they appear in the darkness, they disappear quickly and silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rock... Mr. Locke! That...just that...what is it?" Kim asked in a stuttering voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course the behind-the-scenes power of the Orcs re-initiating the attack!" Old Locke said to the magician, "Did you not hear it? But forget this. It’s a dream, just a nightmare!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“But...”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Young people! Listen to me, even if you can't forget him, at least don't talk to other people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold is no longer Speaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, young people, it’s already late, let’s go to sleep! If you want, then come over every night, I can teach Some of your magical skills..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mysterious sage It has not appeared, the adventurers have passed through the half-orc wilderness safely. After more than half a month's journey, they once again saw the city walls of Hope City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s finally back!” Lev said happily. “I thought I couldn’t see the city again in this life!” everyone is happy. Going into the city, for them, looking for a hotel now, taking a good night is the most important thing. After this dangerous journey, everyone has been physically and mentally exhausted. As soon as I entered the city, I went straight to the hotel where they lived (the hotel was lucky enough not to be destroyed in the siege war). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, but we have to break up here!" At the door of the hotel, Old Locke suddenly told everyone. Everyone is stunned. "Mr. Locke, I thought you would continue to take risks with us!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope so, but now I have some important things to do. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Do we still have a chance to meet again?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course!" Old Locke pretended to be unhappy. "Do you still owe me money? I just see that you don't have so much money for now, so give you more time, but don't say that the money is not needed!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gold is incomprehensible to other people, Wei and Elna are also the same, they do not know that they "owe" old Lock money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay! Goodbye! Young people, I hope that when we meet next time, you are already a very mature adventurer!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When everyone looks at the old Locke and turns away, his figure quickly disappears at the end of the street. At this time, everyone has a feeling of loss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He must be an amazing magician!" Kim said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's also an amazing adventurer!" Behan added. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And he is still a very kind old grandfather, the baby also likes him!" Beibei finally said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 04<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Big event! Big event!" Lev called all the way When he came in, he waved in his hand the "newest news from the mainland" he just got from the adventurer's union. The three people who are sitting and discussing the future are turning their eyes to the thieves who rushed in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look! The Reiter Empire finally hits the Red Alliance again. !! Lev pointed his finger at the most conspicuous one on the list. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Kim, Behan, and Elna all came together and looked at the list in Lev's hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the end of the tug-of-war in the city of Berwick, the border between the Reiter Empire and the Red Alliance has been very tense. After the Leite Empire occupied the city of Berwick, not only did not withdraw troops in batches, but a large amount of hoarding of grain and materials, it is obvious that the city of Berek should be used as an attack base. The Red Alliance does not hesitate to spend a lot of money, has hired several mercenary groups for a long time, and worked hard to integrate the self-defense forces of each city. Both sides know that this short-lived peace is just paving the way for a bigger war. <br /><br />########################################################################################################## After the German posture, Delant hoarded heavy troops on the border, with the intention of containing the meaning of Leite. But the determination of the Emperor Victor to re-integrate the alliance into the empire was unwavering. At the time of the Continental calendar in January 998 (at this time, Kim was trekking in the half-orc wilderness, followed by the chasing of the half-orcs), the war finally began again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this war was initiated by the Alliance. On January 4, 998, the Alliance decided to raid Berwick City and ruin all the war supplies that the Empire hoarded in Burek. But this very secretive military operation did not know how to be known by the Leite Empire. The Victor Emperor personally led the ambush of the Alliance Army striker at the Tallinn Peak, defeating the unprepared marching Alliance Army, the Dagger 3 More than 10,000. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Alliance Army immediately retreated, and Victor used the excuse (Tallinn is the territory of Berwick City) to launch a war that invaded the Alliance. On January 10th, the two armies confronted an unnamed small grassland in the alliance. The army of more than 300,000 troops (140,000 troops of the Leite Army and 170,000 troops of the Alliance Army) fought fiercely, from morning to night, and In the morning. On the second day of the dawn, Victor personally rushed into battle when both armies were exhausted, leading the Guards to a decisive blow to the Alliance's weakest left wing. The Alliance Army was finally destroyed by Victor and was decapitated more than 100,000. The Remnant retreated to the city of Izumo, which is the title of "the first strong city in the mainland." Victor knows that there is not enough power at this time, and when he is ready, he will return to the country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After reading the contents of the newsletter, everyone sighed, and while the threats of other races are getting bigger, the countries are still doing internal Self-defeating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right! Wei? Is he going out with you? How can you only come back alone?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't say it! Say I am sad! I wanted to ask the fat uncle for our reward today! Where did he think that he and the Mingke had already ran away? If it were not for the sake of saving the kid, where would we be? Have you encountered so many dangers?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Running??"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes! We went to the hotel where he lived. The boss told us that the two of them had already retired the room a month ago! So I went to the soldiers in the city to inquire. The soldiers confirmed that there were indeed two people who left more than 20 days ago. Here, I went to the south."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To be honest, I really didn't think Wei was so interested in the former, he knew it. After the two people left, the whole person was stunned. In fact, he didn’t care about this money. After all, he is also a sword saint. It’s very profitable. Yi, not like me ...... "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;"? Wei in the end gone, "Kim interrupted Lev words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He went to buy new armor! It will take another while to come back!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In the afternoon, all the adventurers discussed the next step together, but in fact the plan was long-established - they agreed that they would continue their journey interrupted by the Orcs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road was very smooth. After the last half-orc invasion, the northern part of Dike has stepped up its alert. The small band robbers that might have threatened passengers have now disappeared. The only trouble for the adventurers is that the northern waters are already frozen, and they have to walk slowly, killing a little bit of time waiting for the ice to melt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a month of walking, (although there are carriages, they chose to walk, spend a little more time), they arrived at Shark Harbor, just When I encountered the first passenger ship after the ice was dissolved, the pedestrians quickly got on the passenger ship and marched quickly toward the south along the spring current. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the morning, Kim was awakened by a burst of noise on his bed. Because nothing happened in the past few days, the magician is reviewing the control skills that Old Locke taught him all day long. In other words, he is lying in bed and sleeping lately (the review is in the unobtrusive night, of course, during the day. Can't climb up). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong?" He blinked and asked Lev, who was coming in from outside, "What happened?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You still don't know? Today the ship is going to be docked, adding water and food! It takes about two days, we can go ashore! I am bored in this living coffin all day, I am It’s suffocating!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Where are we now?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“In a new The port. It is said that the merchants built it for the supplement of the journey. I have never been to this place. However, no matter what, it is better than this ship. Come up, let's go ashore together!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't want to go..." But the magician's words have not been finished yet, and Lev has already grasped his hand and pulled him hard. "Everyone goes, how can you stay with you? Come on, come on, don't stay in bed!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold helpless, had to put on shoes (he It was the pylon lying down, and Lev pulled all the way out of the cabin and came to the deck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's beautiful!" Lev pointed to a row of new buildings on the shore and said to the magician whose eyes had not been completely opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, very beautiful!" Kim looked up at the absent-mindedness and considered the problem of combining two non-rejective forces - he was in the middle of the night yesterday. Do research in this area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the line of sight and the scenery touched, he stayed, not because of how luxurious and beautiful the pub or villa was, but because he was very Familiar things appear in his vision - a solitary black stone tower stands on a small island very close to the coast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a half-year journey, Kim returned to his starting point, the Stone Tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sleepiness in the mind and the summary of the study of magic disappeared in an instant, and the days of living and studying in the Stone Tower immediately occupied him. Mind. Kim's thoughts under the action of this catalyst immediately completed the process from quantitative change to qualitative change. The teacher's voice and smile seemed to appear in front of him. Kim discovered at this time that he missed his teacher so much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Going ashore!" Jin grabbed Lev’s hand and the thief was overwhelmed by the sudden change of his companion. "I will take you to a good one." Place!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The six people stood under the black stone tower, just like the magician They took the medicine and excitedly pulled them all here. Until this time, Lev remembered that Kim was the apprentice of the owner of the stone tower, and this place should be the stone tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good!" Lev sighed. To be honest, there was no such feeling when I was watching it on the boat, but it was only under the tower that I found the tower tall and magnificent. It is really hard to imagine that this tower was actually made by a magician with magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jin Xing cheerfully took everyone to the gate, and when it was close to the tower, everyone discovered that the tower was really legendary. In the same way, it is pulled directly from the earth with magic. The neatness of the tower is not like manual processing. That kind of smoothness is what the craftsman can't do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everything hasn't changed!" Jin sighed softly. In fact, he only left for half a year, but at the moment he felt that he had left here for more than ten years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody on the second floor, Kim estimated the time. Now if his teacher does not go out, it should be in the meditation room on the seventh floor. He left his friends on the second floor and ran to the seventh floor in three steps and two steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold gently pushes the door of the meditation room, a familiar figure is sitting in the empty room at the moment. Xiu Ke also felt that he turned his head while Kim opened the door, and the two men’s eyes met. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gold!!" The old magician stood up. He couldn’t believe his eyes. In his prediction, his apprentice had at least three It is only possible to come back in the year (of course, it is possible to never come back, just to prevent this, he gave the ring to Kim). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher!" Although Kim was thinking about the conversation that might occur when he was on the run, but when he really saw the teacher, He found that he had betrayed him when he was ready, and he did not know where to go. Except for this "teacher", he can't say anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 05<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gold! You are back!" The old magician walked excitedly He is in front of the apprentice who will not move. When he received the money as a disciple, he had a taste of compromise to his fate, but in the next few years, he had completely liked this young man. At this moment, the old magician took a master to see the long-lost apprentice and a kind father looking at the whole mood of his returning son to welcome the gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher!" Kim found that his vocabulary at the moment was completely blank, and he couldn't say anything except these two words. The impulse in my heart could no longer be suppressed. He suddenly rushed to hug and repaired. Those who fled just suddenly returned with too fast speed. Warcraft, the contest, the war, the half-orc, the bloody battle, the necromancer all said what they wanted to say at the same time, and they couldn’t control whether the language could be understood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mentor and the teacher finally recovered from the joy and excitement of meeting again, and now the apprentice’s now remembers that there is still a <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The batch partner is waiting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher!" Kim pulled the hand of Xiu Ke and walked downstairs. "I introduce you to several of my partners. They can <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All are excellent adventurers..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five people on the second floor are quiet Sitting in this room and waiting. It has been a little time for the magician to go up, but there has been no sign of it. Fortunately, this place is very novel, and everyone will not be bored. At this moment, everyone's attention is attracted by the glowing crystal ball in the middle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s amazing!" Babe lamented, she grabbed her baby’s tail and pulled it off the crystal ball – this is her third time But the baby will soon climb the crystal ball again. After all, it is its nature to love the glowing object - although she has seen countless magic items from her dad, the crystal ball that emits such powerful energy is still the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this thing for?" Behanna wondered why such a powerful magic item should be placed in this place that looks like a living room? Even people who know nothing about magic can feel the energy of this crystal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't have anything to do with other things, it's a separate existence!" Elna looked through a period of time and came to a conclusion. This conclusion overturns Lev's previous assertion that this crystal is the source of power to maintain the existence of the entire tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The footsteps came from the stairs. Everyone knows that the owner of the tower is coming. They all took their attention back from this strange crystal ball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold appeared at the door, behind him, was an old magician who had to be white and tall, and obviously he should be a teacher of gold. · Gram. Everyone stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher, they are the friends I told you! This is Lev, this is Wei..." Jin Xiang teacher one by one introduction partner We. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Welcome everyone, my apprentice Kim has been cared for by all of you, thank you here!" Xiu said as he walked to the front of the table, he used his magic wand to gently tap on the crystal ball. Immediately, a cigarette surrounded the surface of the table. After the smoke dissipated, five teacups appeared on the table, and the teacup was filled with cool juice. "Everyone is sitting, you are welcome, there is nothing good here, I hope you forgive me!" The attitude of the old magician is very polite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s amazing!" Lev looked silly, just knocking on the crystal ball and knocking out five glasses of juice, if knocking Ten times, can you knock out five gold coins? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It used to be like this!" Babe felt a little disappointed. She had seen this method at home, but she did not expect to have such powerful power. It was actually used for this purpose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold is not surprised, this magic crystal ball was dug out by his teacher from an ancient site. Although it has been in this living room, it has not been found to be the right way to use it - although anyone can feel its power. Finally, Xiu Ke had to use it as a medium for entertaining guests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two magicians also sat down and corrected to sit next to Wei. The old magician suddenly felt that Wei had a strange but very weak force. If other people might ignore it, but as a great magician, he immediately felt the power - this power is hidden. Ok, I really can't feel it if I sit next to Wei. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Young people, do you feel any uncomfortable?" Xiu Ke suddenly asked Wei Fa, who was drinking juice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We rushed down the cup in his hand, he wanted to answer with a gesture, but know that his sign language is so bad, not for a long time with him. There is no way for a partner to understand what it means. Although I can't read Wei's sign language, I can see that he can't talk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can't talk right?" Wei's answer - nodded - there is no way to misunderstand. The old magician was very interested. He was the first time he saw a magic that could damage a person's voice but had no effect on other parts. This is a very difficult opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Don’t move!” repaired Wei, then he pinched Wei’s throat with his hand, and when he moved his hand, everyone could see him. The skin of the fingers is completely blackened, like being soaked with corrosive potions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher! This... What's the matter?" Everyone looked at it, and Kim first recovered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's amazing! It's really amazing!" The old magician said as he looked at his hand. "I really didn't think that the world is so powerful." Magic. Can put a long-term energy in a person's body, and still so powerful!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher, what is going on?" The voice finally brought the thought of repair back to reality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You companion, once offended a very powerful magician, or a guy who can use very powerful magic, he called this young man Wei right, using a powerful magic, depriving him of his voice!" Repair and look at his own black fingers. This is the magic of the most powerful magician he has ever seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you cancel?" asked Elna on the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;修·克 Look at other people and look at Wei. At this moment, Wei’s eyes have too many things, hopes and doubts, as well as pain and hatred and desire. At that moment, he suddenly had an illusion that the answer he spit out in his mouth would determine his future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course! I am a big magician!" I know that he had to regret the opportunity to give up this research. After all, the voice is on this. For young fighters, the subject matter of the study is more important to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old magician stood up, Wei also stood up, he thought he would go to a special place to get rid of this magic, but repaired him sit down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xu·ke did not read any mantra, but in front of him, there was a group of light that began to condense, a group of very gorgeous, but very soft color. Everyone feels the power of this magic. Under the control of the repair, this group of light began to move to Wei's body, slowly blending into Wei's throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
