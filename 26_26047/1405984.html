			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 01<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lost in the mainland continent in June 997, one lost in the lost continent The name of the swamp, a bipedal dragon (one of Warcraft, looks like a dragon, the forelimbs evolved into wings, meat, and sharp and poisonous teeth, like the dragon has the hobby of collecting shiny items, but the scales are thin, Perched in a swamp, you can use a few winds of magic.) A stinky tree (a unique woody plant in the swamp, with a strong smell) is a sturdy human being on the foot. In my heart, this is a delicious breakfast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Wyvern is staring at the prey, and it waits patiently until the back of the prey is completely exposed to its own attack before it launches an attack. It screams to the prey. Behind the fierce rush, while several aeroelastic bombs formed by highly compressed air hit the back of the seemingly unguarded person. In the past experience of this two-legged dragon, it did not know how many victims were eaten in the same way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The compressed air bomb hit the back of the prey accurately, but it did not produce the expected result, the person was not knocked down, instead he turned around, The fearless face of the two-legged flying dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Wyvern is aware of the danger, but he’s too aggressive and can’t stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prey sends out a detonation ball, which blasts on the left side of the Wyvern. The powerful shock wave makes it lose its balance while putting its direction of the fight. Went to the right, the two-legged dragon slammed into the ground! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a moment, a camouflage cloth of the same color as the swamp on the ground was uncovered, a person jumped out, his right hand waved, and the two flying knives were accurate. Hit the eyes of the Wyvern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hunter and prey have completely exchanged positions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Wyvern’s painful screams, but its suffering has not stopped, a flame sprays on it, and it loses its vision. Open, the whole body is surrounded by raging fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It makes a painful cry while rolling on the ground, trying to get the swampy muddy ground to extinguish the flame, but this flame is absolutely before the magic effect stops. Will not go out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The struggle of the Wyvern is slowly weakening, and a figure rushes forward, piercing its throat with a short sword and freeing it from pain. come out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man pulled out the short sword and jumped back agilely without letting a drop of acidic blood splash on himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Call, finally got rid of it!", the two men all wiped the sweat on their heads together, and one took out a strange whistle and started to force Blow it up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several lizards (Lizards are one of the smart races lost on the continent, they live in swamps, are covered with scales, and have a long tail, Because they are different from human beings, they have no essential conflict with human beings. The two sides completely accept each other's existence. Although human beings divide the territory of the lizards as part of the national land when dividing the borders, the land is completely detached. Beyond the limits of human domination, lizards have a certain relationship with humans, usually with merchants. With the whistle in the fog of the swamp, they see the huge body of the bipedal dragon on the ground, cheering . Then there were more lizards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lizard man carried two adventurers, carrying the body of the Wyvern, and returned to the village of the lizard in a laughter. The lizards in the village came out to welcome the warriors who had won. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lizard elders walked out of the crowd, thanked the two human adventurers in continental lingua franca, and handed out 100 gold coins to the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two adventurers received the reward and accepted the invitation of the elders to stay in the celebrations tonight. As they looked up and talked to the lizard elders, it was clear that the two men were Kim and Lev. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One month ago, Kim and Lev formed a companion, left Rol City together and took risks. Two days ago, they came to a nearby swamp. Small town, into the adventurer's union to find a job. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am sorry, the one you want has already been done." There was an impatient voice inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there any work that makes money but is difficult or not easy to make money?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No way, is there any work that is neither profitable nor difficult?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a lizard in the nearby swamp that asks someone to get rid of Warcraft that has repeatedly attacked their village. The reward is 100 gold coins. (The gold coin on the mainland is a common currency, and the gold coin is a small circle with a fixed weight. Gold coins with protective magic to ensure that they will not be worn out. Under the gold coins, there are silver coins, copper coins, gold coins, gemstones made of precious stones, diamonds, diamond coins, and the most valuable coins on the mainland. The magic crystal coins made during the Holy Light Dynasty. These currencies are in decimal relationship.)"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just 100 gold coins want people to fight with World of Warcraft Is it too much?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you don't want to pick it up, you can do it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;& Nbsp; "I will pick it up, I will pick it up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Author's Note: Most of the unknown adventurers on the lost continent will find jobs through the adventurer's union to improve themselves. The popularity among adventurers. Some wealthy people or nobles often go directly to famous adventurers, but most of the clients will find someone to complete their commission through the adventurer's union.)<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When coming out of the adventurer’s union, Kim couldn’t help but ask his companion, “Do you have to say so much nonsense to find a job?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Lev looked at Kim with a strange look. "Don't you think that the little girl who works at the Adventurer's Union is quite good?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This is the case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two people easily found the village of the lizard according to the map of the Adventurers’ Union. The lizards looked at two people, including the lizard, with suspicion. The elders are inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold heard a few lizards whispering there: "Do these two adventurers do it? Even the warriors in our village can't kill the feet." Dragon, can these two human adventurers do it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter, the elders decided to pay after seeing the body of the Wyvern. There will be no loss to us. If they can't, the Adventurers' Union will introduce other people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I am afraid that the Wyvern will retaliate The last time we attacked the Wyvern, we failed. As a result, the beast ran to the village and attacked us several times."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold heard their words clearly- ─ Kim has learned the language of almost all intelligent creatures in the Stone Tower. Although not very proficient, there is no problem in understanding the words of these lizards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders began to introduce things related to Warcraft to two adventurers - of course, using continental lingua franca. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This two-legged dragon suddenly appeared in the swamp a few months ago. Before that, there have been no World of Warcraft in this area for hundreds of years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the beginning, several human businessmen who were doing business in the village of the lizard had no news, but this did not cause the attention of the lizards - humans fell It is common to enter the bottomless quagmire. But then a few young lizards did not return, and then found some debris under a stinky tree in the swamp. The lizard people know that something is wrong. In the next few days, the lizard finally found out what had happened—a two-legged dragon settled in the swamp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were several warriors in the lizard who decided to go to destroy the Wyvern, but it turned out that the positive and the Wyvern was a wrong decision afterwards - the Warriors Did not come back, the two-legged dragon came. The injured Wyvern came to the lizard village and killed several lizards. When the lizard took up the weapon and fought, the Wyvern flew away. When the lizard slackened, it Then flew back to attack the lizard man who had placed the order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lizard man had no way to deal with this abominable Warcraft, so he went to the adventurer's union in the city to seek help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The location of the trap is located in a place near the village - there have been many incidents of two-legged dragons attacking lizards. Lev hid himself with a cloth of the same color as the swamp floor, and Kim walked around here as a bait. Of course, he first gave himself a "guardian wind" and prepared an explosive magic in his hand. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold heard a huge wind when he went back and forth to the third time. He knew that the Wyvern was coming. But the Wyvern is considered to be the same as the Lizard (the lizard's vision and sense of smell are very sensitive, but the hearing is quite poor), and he thinks it is an unexpected surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night, Kim and Lev enjoyed the celebration of the lizard man by the campfire, and also tasted the flesh of the Wyvern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, I said, Kim, this two-legged dragon is not so good, it’s a bit too hard."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes? I think it's okay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To tell the truth, today your performance is too good, more than I thought." Ok. Your two magics are really great."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, not as good as you said, I was going to hit the double with the front of the blasting ball. For the sake of the dragon, but because of the tension, the war, but fortunately nothing happened."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a frank guy, unfortunately, the lizard is only willing to pay 100 Gold coins, in fact, can only sell so much money for the meat of the two-legged dragon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold has an understanding of his companions. Lev lost his parents at an early age, and his young and hard life made him a love of money. But Kim believes that his partner is a trustworthy person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leif, do you have any plans for the next step?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course. "Leif reveals a mysterious smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next afternoon, Kim and Lev appeared next to the nest of the Wyvern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Heaven, this is earned!!!" Lev said with a loud voice, "So many!!!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While saying, Lev showed the big diamonds and magic crystal coins in his hand to gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hah, such a good job has fallen into our hands, we are so lucky."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few hours later, in a small shop outside the city's adventurer's union, the lucky duo is enjoying a rich dinner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lev, the next step you said yesterday is to take the treasure in the Wyvern's Nest?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So what are we going to do next?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Don't worry," Lev waved his "newest news from the mainland" to his companions. "We are rich now, how about opening our eyes?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp Gold took a look at the newsletter. The first one was "The Emperor of the Durant Empire held a contest, using the six treasures in the Empire State Treasury as a winner." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 02<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The DeLand Empire is a powerful and powerful empire lost on the mainland (German The Rand Empire is bordered by the Kingdom of Dicco in the north, the Kingdom of Riftwar in the south, the Reiter empire in the east, the Elf in the west, in the center of the continent, and the capital of Durant is full. It reflects the prosperity and prosperity of the Delante Empire. The streets are wide and the population is large. The palace in the center of the city is magnificent and exquisite. However, just this evening, a figure quietly used one! Cable climbed over a palace wall and entered the palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure is obviously familiar with this palace. He accurately advances in the gap of the guard patrol, always avoids searching in those "dead corners", no flowers How much work, this black shadow came to a yard in the depths of the palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a fake mountain not far from the shadow hiding place, he walked out of a sly figure, apparently a girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black shadow came out of the hiding place and slowly approached the girl. After both people confirmed their identity, the two men were together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, let you wait in this garden for so long."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No Relationship, as long as you can meet with you, how long it will take here." The girl said in a sweet voice in her lover's arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right," After a while, the girl broke free from her lover's arms. "I have something to say to you today."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Say, Melia, there is nothing we can hide from each other."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We Can't go on like this!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Melia"!!!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We only I can't get to the sneaky meeting at night. You have to avoid so many patrols to get to the garden, and every time I go back, I have to make up different reasons to get here next time. Don't be suspicious. Don't you think it's so tired?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Melia, I......."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't interrupt me, I think this relationship should be over. If you really love me, you should raise a favor with my father."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Melia, I am not without I have thought about it, but our status is too great. You are the princess of a country, and I am only a small mercenary. Your father can never promise us."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then take me tonight, to a place my father can't find."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Melia!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't worry, I have carefully considered this matter, not a late impulse, you see, I am ready for the luggage." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miliya, you....... Are you really willing to abandon the status and glory of the princess, to be an ordinary wife? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am willing!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man hugged the girl tightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, Melia, with your words, even if I die, I am willing."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We will go tonight!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the man was preparing to carry the princess’s luggage, a broken air came. The man clearly identified the arrow in the night, and he jumped backwards and escaped the arrow easily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A ball of light (the ball of light is an entry-level magic of the magic of the light, almost no lethality, but used to illuminate at night is very effective) On the heads of the two lovers, and then there were more balls of light, illuminating the entire yard. The man held a black-red sword that did not know when it appeared, standing in front of the princess, in In front of the two lovers, there was a middle-aged man with a golden crown on his head and a look of anger. He was full of guards behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two lovers looked around and surrounded by guards and magicians. At least 100 arrows and 30 attacking spells were aimed at us, the man thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You bastard, dare to seduce my daughter, dare to teach her to run away with you, guards!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several archers (an archer is a branch of the warrior, good at using various long-range weapons) raised the bow, the emperor has enough confidence in his subordinate arrows, they promised to shoot the mixed ball in front of them Become a pig and not hurt your baby daughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the emperor’s baby daughter opened her hands and blocked her lover before her body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Melia! You turned out to be........ I have taken care of this kid and defended this low-ranking mercenary. He wants to trick you away from your father!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I love him, Dad, I am willing to go with him. If you kill him now, I will die right away!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor feels her daughter The threat may not be fake. He made a gesture and the archers put the bow down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor tried to convince his daughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are a princess, how can you be with this mercenary without any identity?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "As long as I can be with him, I can't be a princess."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What!" The emperor roared. "You would rather abandon your father." Do you want to be with this guy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Millia bites her lips tightly, no words, but everyone can see from her eyes Affirmative answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor made another gesture, and everyone around him understood what he meant. There was not much time left, and there was only the emperor and his closeness in the garden. Guard, and two little lovers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't be like this, Melia." The emperor changed a gentle tone. "Hey, my father is the most painful, Dad promises you, give You are the most luxurious villa to give you a gift."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, if you really hurt me, then you should promise to let him marry me." "Miliya, you are a princess, you should marry a prince, a nobleman or a warrior, not a low-lying mercenary." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dad, you can't say that, he is brave, I dare say that there are no stronger fighters on the entire continent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor is silent, and his political life has told him that if he kills the man in front of him, then Melia will probably not forgive him for the rest of his life unless he can First change the image of this man in the heart of Melia. By the way, his mind flashed in his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kid!" The emperor first spoke to his daughter's favorite man. "Since Melia is so fond of it (here, he deliberately does not need "love" This word) You, then I will give you a chance. After five days, there will be a contest in the Imperial Capital. If you can show the Wu Yong of the match at the contest, I can consider yours. Marriage. Let me roll now! If I find you here after five minutes, no one can save you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you Dad!" Honey Leah rushed over and kissed her father's face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man went to the garden exit, and Melia chased him up and sent him out of the palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After confirming that Melia and his lover had left, the emperor said to the Guardian of his side, "This matter is handled by you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clear-minded Guardian of the Emperor’s mind stunned and accepted the emperor’s order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a corridor without people, Melia pulled her lover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Promise me, you must win the championship."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I swear! I will definitely Win the championship, then come to you with the wind and the wind. Otherwise, I will die!" His last words were so low that Melia could not hear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miliya took off a diamond pin on her chest and put it on the lover's hand. "This is my mother's relic, it has always been my favorite." Something, now for you, you must remember to give it back to me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will return it to you!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hour later, in one of the palaces, the Guardian is talking to several subordinates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A person has retired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Several of you are the strongest people in the palace. Now I want you to participate in the contest of five days later, remember that before the kid is defeated, You must not lose!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the subordinates went out, near The sergeant said to himself, "The kid is really amazing. If there is one-on-one, I have nothing to grasp." He suddenly laughed because he had already thought of a good way. "But I still have a trump card. The rules of the game were made by me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The morning of the emperor, the sun According to the whole city, tell everyone that today is another good weather. The city of Delante is very lively, and the goods stalls on the roadside are almost outside the city gate. There are businessmen who are eager to drink everywhere, and there are bargains for buying goods everywhere. During this period of time, the business was particularly good, and the riches of the contest were held. The merchants in the city even planned to ask the Emperor Nicholas III of Delant to hold similar activities every year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold and Lev arrived yesterday. Today, they walked out of the hotel and took a leisurely walk to the contest venue. The contest venue was already crowded. In addition to the hawkers who pedd the goods, there are tens of thousands of people who sign up for the competition and reserve tickets for the competition, and the place is crowded with water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold is very energetic, and Lev is very agile, and two people are rushing in and not having too much trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just near the point of purchase of the ticket, Kim found that there was a bit of turmoil in the crowd, and a group of people were crowding the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get out of the way, get out!" Hearing and screaming, in a twinkling of an eye, several people have already arrived near Kim and Lev, and Kim clearly looks To a few five big three big squats are rushing over here, but they are using their fists to open the road. They kept throwing punches at the people around them, forcing people to let go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold looked at the people who were constantly being beaten by them, he wanted to come forward to stop, but the retreating crowd could not force him to move. At this time, Lev got out of the crowd, escaped the first fist, and hit him with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Blinking, kid!" A fist came to Lev, but Lev swiftly escaped the attack and returned to the crowd. Kim saw that Lev had drilled out of the crowd again and again and bumped into these people, feeling very inexplicable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After hitting each one once, Lev made a gesture to Kim, and Kim’s full-fledged question first squeezed out the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leif is already waiting for the gold outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leif did not answer, but pulled out of the clothes A wallet, and then another one, he pulled out six packs in a row (the thieves have nothing to do with the thief, but their professional name is called a thief, but it is obvious that Lev is very good at the technique of empty hands) . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lev looked at these wallets, "nice, very rich He said to Kim, "This is a lesson for them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold also smiles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We will go back to the hotel. If the owners find us, we will be worse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;.......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold and Lev fled on the road, and the six fully armed guys were catching up. Lev couldn’t think of such a coincidence in the world, and he would stay in the same hotel with these guys. Fortunately, the armor and the weapons in those guys are quite heavy, and Lev is not burdened with heavy things, and the golden muscles are also very developed, so You can get out of the hotel one step at a time, otherwise, God knows that they will become a few. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Have you made a mistake? Only six people are chasing us now. If I use a blasting ball, I am afraid that there will be a thousand people chasing us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Then you won't use a faster magic that lets us escape?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is OK." Kim began to sing a spell . "The power in the atmosphere turns into my wings, let me fly to the sky" (flying, a magic that allows the magician to fly freely, but will continue to consume magic). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold seized Lev’s hand and took him to fly to the sky, leaving a few chasing screaming on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Call, so tired!" Kim after consuming all the magic Only landed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people are now in a grove next to the outskirts of the city of DeLand, and Lev looked up and determined that no one was chasing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Really, it’s great to be with a magician." Lev said as he walked outside the woods. "I have no flight experience before." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold is also behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Leif was about to step out of the woods, he suddenly stopped, his face with a weird expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold found the anomaly of his companion, he took a step forward and looked at the eyes of this husband--two men, one woman and three women on the road. At this time, Lev grabbed the gold arm tightly. "You see no!!!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you see?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The woman," Lev grabbed Kim’s arm tighter, and his words were full of intoxicating tone. “My husband Sinde swears, I must marry her. Wife!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 03<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three people on the road dress up differently, head down Walking is a tall man dressed as a knight. He wore an ordinary knight's helmet, wearing a full body squat, an iron-footed boot, a waist-shouldered sword, and a mask on his face, which made people feel a little weird. His walking posture is even more strange. He walks up and never bends his knees, like a big puppet. Kim was deeply surprised. There are people who can wear such heavy armor to take a long road. Ordinary people can't even walk on it (the whole body 铠 + helmet + iron boots = 60 kg). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one that walks in is the beauty of Lev. She looks like she is 18 to 20 years old and she is really beautiful. An impeccable face with a forever smile, this is probably her most used expression, but every passionate man will mistake her smile for herself. Kim couldn't help but compare her with Mimi, but he immediately exhaled the idea - Mei Mi is already the wife of others, he can no longer think of her. Kim noticed the dress of this beautiful woman - she was wearing a therapist's gown, she was a therapist! (Author's Note: The therapist used to be a magician, but it has now become independent. This is mainly because of the metamorphosis of the life and healing god Leica, all therapists can not use the power other than Leica, And you can't use any weapons or armor, or Leica will reject his prayers so that he can never use the power of healing. The therapist is lost in a very respected profession on the mainland, if not a few cities A proprietary therapist, it is not worthy of being called a metropolis. In wartime, the therapists in the army are almost as important as the grass, and the number of therapists is directly reflected in the morale of the soldiers, so when the war is broken, the therapist The first batch was always collected. Because of this, during the raid, the attacker’s first offensive target was a therapist without any resistance, taking them as far as possible, or killing them. Such attacks often It will deal a heavy blow to the morale and sustained combat capability of the other side. This kind of warfare once made the therapist a rare animal. In the 781 continent, the countries signed After the fight for the Convention, the therapist began to increase again, but even now, the therapists lost on the mainland are only about 10,000. In addition, although not comparable to the therapist, advanced magicians can use some The magic of healing.) Kim recognizes the black-skinned therapist's robe on her body. This beauty is a primary therapist (like other professions, the level of the therapist can be identified by the appearance, and the black-rimmed white robe is the primary The therapist, who is wearing a pure white robe, is an intermediate therapist and a senior therapist in a white robes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man who walked in the last side dressed as a standard wandering swordsman, quite a bit handsome and chic. He wore a light armor and a chic sword on his waist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lev began to move forward, and Kim wanted to see what his companions could come up with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three people are getting closer and closer, and Kim discovers that Lev is moving toward the beauty in the bushes by the roadside - if it goes well, Lev arrives big The beautiful girl just happened to be next to him on the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight suddenly stopped, he made a gesture, the two people behind stopped, and the knight suddenly pulled out the sword hanging in the waist, the sword The direction pointed by the tip is Lev - he is absolutely invisible to him in his position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Kim was wondering, the Cavaliers had an action. He waved several swords in the direction of Lev, and several swordsmanships were sent from his sword. With the sand and sand that was rolled up on the ground, fiercely flew to Lev. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Awesome (the level of gold’s good friend, you must first use a period of time to send a sword wind, this knight seems to be without any preparation A number of swordsmen have been issued, and the level is high!) Kim has already determined that he found Lev, but now he wants to stop it too late, not to mention that he has used up all his magical power. Kim can only hope that Lev can be more complete, for example, only divided into two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leif also knows what he is facing. Fortunately, many years of adventure have developed his keen eye and quick response, he recognized it in a flash. Out of his only way of life, just in front of the Jianfeng and the body, he flew forward, and he couldn’t escape from the gap of Jianfeng. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sword wind passed through the bushes and fell onto an innocent stone. The stone was scarred and the strongest sword wind almost took it. Split into two halves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leif made a roll after the front, and now he is on the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two people behind came up and the Cavaliers didn't have new moves. Kim also ran out of the woods and stood by his partner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman and the knight made a few gestures and then walked to Lev and Kim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, two. My companion said that he just felt a strong murderousness, so he launched an offensive, but after you came out, the murderousness disappeared. You don't look like a robber, I think, it must be his illusion, I apologize to you for his sorrow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If just Lev If there is such a bit of anger in my heart, I have already flew to Java in the country after listening to the gentle and apology of the beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will treat you for it!" The female therapist noticed the scar on Lev, who was half-squatted, and was just scratched by the shrub. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the beautiful woman who is close to himself, kneeling and putting his hand on the wound on his face, Lev has completely felt his little wound The feeling of getting better slowly, completely fascinated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leif is awake (in fact, he is so fascinated for a few seconds), only to find that the small wound on his face is already good, and his hands But holding the therapist's left hand - how good it feels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the feeling is not good, the therapist grabs Lev's arm with his right hand and pulls it away from his left hand. Lev felt that his hand was not caught by the woman's filigree hand, but a pair of iron tongs, and he couldn't help but let go (Elna is very strong). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the two sides disengaged, Lev noticed the blue mark on his arm—just the feeling was definitely not his own illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My name is gold, this is Lev, I think, just a misunderstanding." The trainee magician spoke up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you," the therapist stood up. "My name is Elna, this is Wei." She pointed to the knight who had already put away the sword. "This It’s Behan.” She points to another companion. “We want to go to the city of Delante to attend the contest.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“This road leads to Delante The road to the city," Lev also stood up. "We are also in the city of Delante. I think we can go with us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To The road to the city of Delante is not very far, about three hundred miles away. In these 30-minute hours, Lev had a general understanding of the situation. Wei is a dumb, but the mute is very bad. Except that Elna doesn't have anyone else to understand what he wants to express, this is probably the reason they are together. But Behan is different. His eyes are not the same as Lev. For the sake of simplicity, this guy wants to pursue Elna. However, from the point of view of speech, there is still no success. Lev is still very hopeful. Similarly, Behan also analyzed the two men. Kim seems to be no threat, but Lev is obviously a rival. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Emperor of the Durand Empire, Nikolai III, ordered that the rules of the game be modified a little in order to increase the level of the competition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1, the competition must be conducted in small groups, a group of at least five people, and less than five groups are not allowed to enter the competition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2, the game is changed to a wheel battle, each team sends a team member each time, the winner must face the next player, but can rest in the middle Very embarrassing. The loser must not play again in the same game. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3, the player's hand fainted, verbally admit defeat, start the game is not inside, not leaving the game, leaving the game venue during the game, the death is defeated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. In the competition, the players can fight in any way, but it is forbidden to help the companions in the competition or in the competition in any way outside the competition. The offenders are all lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous registration is invalid, please return to the registration office. But watching tickets is still valid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Author's Note: From the perspective of the new rules of the game, it seems that for the self-evident, it seems that the Guardian has made the biggest trump card in his hand. Use))<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reactions of the five people are different, Jin and Wei are nothing to look like, Lev is the heart of the hilarious, Elna is thinking, Behan began to talk to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Would you like two more people? Where can I find it?" Behan obviously wanted to catch his rival. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Lev, Mr. Jin, I have an arbitrarily request, can you team up with us to participate in the competition? I promise not to let you go on the adventure! "Aerna's words broke the dream of Behan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can I refuse the request of a beauty like you," Lev was ecstatic, rushing to wait for the answer, "not to mention me." I also like adventure and fighting, and my companion is just a trainee magician, but has the power of a great magician. This is a good opportunity to prove his strength."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leif this guy, actually used me as an excuse!" Kim smiled in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And, please don't call me Mr. Lev, just call me Lev, Miss Elna," Lev continued. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you, Lev, you can call me Elna, you don't have to add "Miss.""<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leif turned his head and just met Behan’s eyes. Kim felt that he could almost see the sparks in his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since we are companions from now on, I think I should introduce myself again. My name is Lev, Lev Sinde, my profession is a thief. It was an adventurer," Lev turned his head and said to Elna. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My name is Elna, Elna Sidla, a therapist, please advise."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides Dumb Wei, four people reintroduced themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The newly formed five-member team set off immediately after finding a hotel, because Lev proposed to register at the registration office when there were fewer people at dusk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are fewer people at dusk than in the morning, but they cannot say that there are very few people. When Lev walked, he worried that there would be a fully armed guy who would jump out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the vicinity of the registration office, people form a big circle, obviously, something is happening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When five people approached the registration office, they couldn’t help but want to see what attracted so many people, but they saw it after being squeezed into the crowd. A wonderful (horror?) scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A big man is confronting a Warcraft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 04<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of the eye is a bald giant, he has a pair of almost the same bull The beautiful muscles, the beard on the face, and a scar on his face made him add a bit more fierce and look like a monster. His hand is a double-edged axe that matches his appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Attack!" The little girl spoke. It turned out that she was a summoner, and this Warcraft was summoned by her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warcraft roared and rushed to the big man, and the claws sent a blow to the other side. If a hit hits, it is guaranteed to make this big man into a few section. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Dahan uses a dexterity that is not commensurate with his huge body, avoiding this quick but easy-to-see blow, letting his axe from below Slanting up and down, from the flaws caused by the failure of the Warcraft attack, an axe cut off the head of Warcraft. Warcraft fell down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big man shook his axe and said to the little girl proudly, "Little girl, see what else you have."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;;&nbsp;&nbsp; But he didn't feel proud for a long time, he knew from the screams of the surrounding observers that something happened, he turned his head, and the World of Warcraft, who had just separated himself, had stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that Warcraft has no head, but it has a head in his chest, it looks more ferocious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warcraft roared once again, the speed was much faster than the last time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will cut you in half, see if you can regenerate!" In the roar, the great man showed his superb skills, he escaped. Every attack of Warcraft, the Warcraft in the hands of the Warcraft is forced to retreat. Dahan quickly found a chance to realize his own words - he divided Warcraft into two halves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the two-and-a-half Warcraft is still squirming, the body suddenly grows a lot of tentacles on both sides, the tentacles are connected together, and the two halves are quickly reassembled. together. Now that it is standing up again, it looks even more terrible. In addition to the sharp claws, there are dozens of tentacles on Warcraft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now it’s the turn of the big man to step back, no matter how superb his combat skills are, he can’t fight dozens of tentacles. But he finally found an opportunity to split a tentacles in half, and what made him desperate was that the tentacles split into two halves immediately turned into two to continue his attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warcraft is rushing forward, stalking the big man with tentacles, throwing him to the ground and biting his bald head, but the big man is stubborn with an axe Blocked its mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winning and losing points, just when people are going to persuade the little girl to let go of each other, the change is sudden! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A fierce, murderous murder with cold and bitter hatred from the crowd, people are all shocked by this murderous, have seen the source of murderous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People are concentrating on a tall man with armor and mask on his face. Although he could not see the expression on his face, he could see from his bloodshot eyes that he was completely in anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei’s spirit is in a frenzy, the appearance of Warcraft in front of him reminds him of the past, these hateful Warcraft, all his blood rushed to the brain, Let him forget that now is just a contest between a summoner and a warrior. There is a voice in his heart that screams in the wild, "kill it, kill it!". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei jumped out of the crowd (in fact, no one dared to stop in front of him), he did not respond with a strange speed The Warcraft rushed away, the long sword was already in the hand, and the sword was shrouded in a ray of light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only Warcraft has just come and stood up, the sword has been body. The sword in Wei’s hand was made into a steel storm, and the body of Warcraft was ruthlessly broken into pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of Warcraft is divided into about 30 copies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The debris scattered on the ground completely lost its vitality, and some force is ruthlessly destroying its cells, making it impossible to regenerate, just within a few seconds, Every piece is turned into dust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We completely disregarded the bald man on the ground, and his eyes turned to the next goal - the little girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little summoner was retired by Wei Yizhen, scared, and in the extreme horror, she successfully summoned the next Warcraft. (The Summoner is also a branch of the Sorcerer, but the object of their communication is not God, but creatures living in high or low dimensions. Although these creatures are also called Warcraft, but with Warcraft that lives on the lost continent, The summoner can summon and manipulate these Warcraft to serve them, but only one can be summoned at a time. The summoner is a very talent-dependent profession, as long as there is talent, it can be manipulated at a very young age. Powerful Warcraft. Now the Summoner has fallen, because everyone knows the best way to deal with Warcraft - kill the unresisting Summoner himself.)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei continued to move forward. He didn't seem to feel anything under his feet. He easily touched the hand in half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little girl saw it all and saw the terrible steel geek approaching himself step by step, seeing the madness in his eyes, getting scared, when When the terror accumulated to a certain extent, it finally broke out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little girl burst into tears, tears pouring down her eye frame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wow........." The crying sounded and Wei’s mind was restored to reason, and he now finds out what he has done, the little call in front of him. The sergeant has no relationship with the enemy he does not share. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei’s four companions have already run over, and the three men have embraced Wei (in fact, this has no effect, Wei has calmed down), Elna Then used to comfort the crying little girl. Wei suddenly felt that he was self-confident - he even cried a little girl to cry. He took his own partner and took the sword from his own hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl’s tears flowed like a river, and Elna was the task of repairing the river embankment. When the little girl finally calmed down, Elna’s The white robe is full of tears and snot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are close to the little girl, he wants to apologize--although most people don’t understand his bad language, but the little girl hides in Ayr as soon as he sees him. Behind Na. Wei had to go away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When everything calms down, the surrounding onlookers have dispersed, and those registrations have been closed. Elna only began to face this new trouble - the little girl took her white robe and refused to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Little sister, what is your name?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Babe."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where does your family live? Can your sister send you back?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"........."< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why don't you talk? Your mother must be waiting for you at home? Go back soon?" Elna naturally thought that the little girl in front of her eyes was living. In the city of Delante, at least the elders came to the city to watch the lively. Otherwise, how can a young girl in her teens be alone here? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I.......I don't know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you not know the address of your home? It doesn't matter, just tell me something near my home, my sister will help you find it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes....... Yes.... Yes, there are a lot of Water, fish, crabs, and lots of bones, Dad said it was the sea, I lived in the island."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Island?" The Delante Empire in the central part of the mainland can be at least 3,000 kilometers away from the sea, but Elna did not give up. After all, Babe may have been brought here by the elders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So how did you come here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know, this afternoon I went to Dad’s library to play and saw a round magic circle. I stood here and got here. There are so many people here. I want to find someone to ask for directions, but the guy looks at me and bullies me. Just call out the 'big green scales' to teach him, and then....." Babe looked at the far Wei of the station with a fearful look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next question is similar. Babe can’t tell the name of his parents’ elders (she only knows the name), and can’t tell her hometown. The name, in a word, simply doesn't know where to send her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But looking at her pitiful look, the five people couldn’t bear to leave her alone, so she had to take her to the hotel, as for If you sign up, you have to wait until tomorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night, five people discussed how to deal with this small bag. To put it bluntly, Elna’s opinion prevailed (very normal, Lev and Behan are sure Supporting Elna), they decided to bring this little devil during the contest. After the game is over, do other plans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At dinner, Kim discovered Wei’s true face – a handsome face with no mask at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few months ago, Elna and Behan met Wei in a port in the Leite Empire. At that time, due to Wei’s terrible language, he and the sailors on the ship could not communicate at all. Elna came forward to help him become a translator. After he solved it, Wei joined them. Hearing Wei said that he came from the dark continent of the mainland, and he wanted to revenge by strengthening his strength because his family was killed by a demon. Although he has some weirdness, he is indeed a good person and a strong companion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Author's Note: The Dark Continent is a mysterious land lost in the East of the mainland, and also a land of lost land in the eyes of mainlanders. A long time ago, lost in the mainland People often exile people who have committed felony to the dark continent. There are about ten to fifteen thousand human beings on the dark continent, known as barbarians. The dark continent is full of demons and warcraft, threatening the survival of human beings. There are some other races that are enemies of mankind. In this cruel environment, the people of the Dark Continent have developed a very vulgar custom.)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wei saw that Warcraft is like crazy." Jin Xin thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Children are really weird, only one night, Babe is familiar with everyone. Especially Wei and Jin, especially Wei. No, just the next day when they went to sign up, Babe was sitting on Wei's left shoulder and went with them. I couldn't see how much she was afraid of Wei yesterday. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time it was very smooth, and Lev dexterously squeezed in front of the registration office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it time to sign up, is there five people?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Exactly five "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A person will register for ten gold coins, well, report the name."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"金!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leif!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Behan!"< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elna, and Wei!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And Babe!" Little girl Suddenly screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bei........Bei, well, hey, a total of six! Why do you just say five? A total of sixty gold coins."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a minute, wrong, that little girl doesn't count."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Wrong, you mean me Would you like to tear this list up and rewrite it? Also, take 50 gold coins!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, Babe also wants to enter!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several people exchanged sights. They all thought of the rules of the game, and they didn't want the black-hearted staff to earn 40 gold coins in vain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, this is your brand. You will be playing here three days later. You will enter the game with your brand. Your time and time will be written on the sign. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this way, the six-person competition team is composed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 05<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The six-person team appeared at the venue. This is the preliminaries, but the audience is still crowded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Kim’s proposal, six people arrived at the contest venue half an hour earlier, so they could also look at the level of other contestants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the official news released by Delante, there were 166 teams participating in the contest, with a total number of more than 900. However, from the perspective of gold, it is not so much an unprecedented operation as it is. Because most people are not coming to participate in the competition but are cheaper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the tickets for the competition are quite tight, the price is quite expensive, and the top row of tickets requires fifty gold coins. The shrewd person suddenly thinks of a problem - the top row of tickets costs 50 gold coins, but the front row (the position where the contestants rest) but only 10 gold coins, this is a good deal. As a result, the contestants were continually enrolled, and when the official found that there were fraudulent measures and effective measures, a large number of people had been mixed into the contestants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s finally a coincidence that I’ve finally reached the six-person team’s game time – the other side is exactly six people, and it’s six people Kim and Lev know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The six wallet thieves recognized two of the opponents, all of them angry, but also fortunate - the last time they escaped with flying magic This time, I can't escape. They all checked their weapons and they were already planning to split their opponents in the ring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the process of the game was not bloody, Wei went to the downfall, he accidentally (???) when he competed with the first opponent Jianfeng, although escaped by opponents, is enough to let the opponent give up the game. Then, the remaining five people of the other side immediately expressed their confession--depending on the level of their swordsmen, they dared not challenge the Wei who showed the advanced swordsmanship skills. Six people left the ring with dingy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of person is the most common of the adventurers - they are very brave in front of their weaker opponents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are nothing to say in the next few games--the opponents are the people who watched the game nearby, and they didn’t even see the opponent’s appearance. It was only after being stationed in the ring, it was announced that it had won. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the blessings of the savvy, the weird squad (this is the nickname that the audience gave them, because their composition is too strange, even the children Yes) Did not hit a real battle to kill the preliminaries, into the top 32. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On August 15, 997, the city of Delante, the capital of the Durant Empire, was empty, and there were few people in the bustling city. Almost all the citizens have arrived at the Kaige Square in the suburbs. Today, the official opening ceremony of the contest will be held here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kai Ge Plaza is a conference venue on the outskirts of DeLand that can accommodate more than 150,000 people. It was built by William, the founding monarch of Durant. The original purpose was to let the emperor give a speech or hold a large-scale military parade. However, due to too many people to watch, the emperor had to hold an opening ceremony here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 9 o'clock in the morning, Emperor Majesty and the Crown Prince and the restless Princess Melia (Nicholas III has five sons and one daughter) appeared in Kaige The square, the host of the contest, the Guardian, announced the opening ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then is the speech of the Emperor’s dear, "Dear people........ (The following omits the smelly and long official articles), my words are over." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thunderous applause, I don’t know if the emperor said it was good, or celebrated that he finally finished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next step is the speech of the Prime Minister of the Empire (I will not repeat it here, I believe that everyone has little interest in official articles). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, outside the Kaige Square, there are people who use the results of the game to gamble everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Try your luck, guess the final champion, the odds are one to eight!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Try it with a little money, who will win the first and second teams!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;吆 吆 此 此 此 此 此 此 此 此 此 此 此 此 此 此 此 此 此 此 此 此 此 此 此 此 此 此 此 此 此 此 此 此<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh," I can’t stand the official article of Kim’s exit from the venue but see the odds of gambling. “It’s going to be one to five, in the eyes of everyone, Are we so vulnerable? It’s no wonder that we haven’t encountered a slightly stronger opponent before.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When gold comes back, it’s just right I saw the speech of the Prime Minister. Then the host of the conference began to read the rules of the contest again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nikolai III was listening absent-mindedly, when a bodyguard ran to whisper a few words to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, it’s weird, that kid didn’t sign up, isn’t it possible?” The emperor glanced at him not far, as if he was looking for something from the crowd. The daughter of the man, "Give me a check and see if there is any guy who hides the real face in the preliminaries."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Your Majesty, the first team and The fourth team has a masked guy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Guardian on the stage finally ended his speech and said loudly: "Now, the game begins! Please enter the players today."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The various sounds are mixed into a huge sound wave, and the scorpion can almost be quarreled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the audience calmed down, he began to introduce two teams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "On my left is the first squad. The composition of this team is very complicated," he looked at Wei unwillingly. "What careers are there?" However, the strength is very strong. Standing on my right is a very pure team of magicians, all of whom are the pro-disciples of the first magician of the mainland, Raymond Sordo, who is a high-profile winner. Team.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because they didn’t buy tickets for other games, they only saw the opponent’s appearance until now, but fortunately the other party seems to be looking at them for the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bright!" Jin recognized the youngest one in the team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gold!" The other party also recognized him. It was a great pleasure for the classmates to meet, but the two magicians are different. They are Although the relationship does not reach hatred, it has already surpassed disgust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now each side sends a player to play." With the voice, the Royal Druids set a magical enchantment next to the ring to prevent the game. Inadvertently hurt the audience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s strange, why did the magician participate in the contest?" Lev was puzzled, and everyone else was the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a saying in the warrior that "the magician does not belong to the ring." This is indeed the case, the downfall completely isolates the biggest helper of the magician and the warrior in battle - distance. The magician is a high-attack, low-defense, low-speed career. Under the protection of his companions, the magician will become the enemy's biggest threat, but if he puts the magician alone in the hand-to-hand combat, he is like a lame. The rabbit is as good as it is. If the magician is fighting a warrior, he must maintain a suitable distance, a distance sufficient to complete the spell before the soldier rushes to his side. But the five magicians in front of you have ignored this point, and there must be some reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright was the first to step into the ring. The magic wand on his hand was enough to show the status of his great wizard. He looked at him without even a magic hat. The former classmates said in a proud tone: "Gold, come up, I want to calculate the old account with you in the Magic Academy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold though I know that Brett is a guy who must report, but he did not expect him to put these old things in his heart. He can't ignore this challenge and resolutely embarked on the downfall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclamation came out of the audience, and a trainee magician dared to accept the challenge of a great magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two magicians stood face to face, and the two sides began to read the mantra almost simultaneously, and it was the same magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The omnipresent magic factor, obey my call and guard my body." (The guardian of the star, a versatile defensive magic.) Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A layer of faint brilliance encircles the magician's body. After completing the defense, both magicians begin to read the attacking magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold is using the explosive ball "The beating fire elf, turned into my anger, destroying my enemies."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright is using the arrow "I am calling the blasphemy in the name of Ivrit, the god of fire, to destroy everything in front of me."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a starting point, the two magicians began a magical battle that looked wonderful and spectacular. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heads-up between the magicians is actually very formulaic. The two magicians are ready to defend the magic, then use a magic to test the strength of the opponent, if the opponent If the strength is weaker than yourself, continue to attack with the attacking magic. If the opponent is stronger than himself, use the defensive magic with less magic to make a simple defense. When the opponent's attack begins to become weak and weak, it begins to counterattack, the opponent will resist with defensive magic, and so on, until the magic of one side is completely exhausted. (Of course, if one party can use the spell that the opponent's defense can't resist, you can beat the opponent in one fell swoop)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kim is very surprised, and the Breit in front of him seems to be so powerful compared to the past. In the memory of Kim, Brett was a poor student. Even his graduation exams were probably approved by the invigilator. But Kim is now changing his mind. If it wasn't for Raymond Sordo's education, then Brett had been hiding his strength in school. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright’s surprise is definitely not lost to gold. Five years ago, he became a disciple of Raymond Sordo. Raymond was a very strict teacher and he had a high degree of authority. The identity of Brett did not make him treat differently. Try hard to learn. If one day is lazy, the teacher's punishment will fall on him unceremoniously. Under this pressure, Brett finally made great progress in magic. Not long ago, Raymond Sordo asked him to use the magical "magic increase" of Taikoo. In one day, Brett got the magic that other people had to acquire for twenty years. With this, Brett passed the test of the Great Sorcerer and always thought that he was the strongest magician of his peers (only 23 years old, a great magician, really amazing). But the gold in front of him has shaken his idea that the power of gold does not lose to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can this kid be so strong? Right, he must have eaten the excited drugs. Kim strengthened his magic while comforting himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This poor boy, he has no teacher pointing (Breut certainly does not know Jinbai Damagian tutor) is a trainee magician, How could there be such a strong magic? He must have been exhausted and fishing, and now he is almost gone. With this in mind, Brett has strengthened the magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame and the frozen gas collide between the two, the lightning bombards the defensive shield, the wind blade cuts the ground of the ring, both sides fight hard, both have attack Keep it. The audience was silent by this wonderful game. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was finally calm down on the stage, and both of them took this anger and were unwilling to look at the opponent still standing in front of them. The magic of the two magicians has been used up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people are trying hard to use a magic again, as long as they can show one more, they can defeat the opponent in front of them, but their bodies are resisting the will. To their request, the beginning of the prayer, the body can not bear the pain. The two have indeed used up the last trace of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, both people seem to think of something and laugh, it is a smile that determines their victory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold rushed to the opponent, he has 100% confidence to find the cloth in the flat of the floor - in terms of physical strength, gold rivals A lot stronger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright lifted the magic wand in his hand, and a crystal embedded in it began to glow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gold, get rid of it, that is the magic crystal!" Lev yelled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic crystal is a magical magic crystal that can be stored in magical magic. The value of the magic is not affordable. But in the current identity of Brett, it is not uncommon to have a magic magic wand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Author's Note: Power Magic is a general term for magic that transforms items to have certain magical qualities. In ancient times, almost all magicians knew each other. The magic, so create a lot of magic items. But now these items are very rare. Now the magicians rarely learn the power of magic, because they think that the magician should go out to risk or study, instead of making magic items and then come out To sell, the magician is not a craftsman. The magician who will use the magic of magic will rarely make magic items, let alone spend a lot of time to make fine works. Kim’s teacher, repairing * is an exception, he is very skilled magic. I also like to spend time making some magic items, of course, only for myself.)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Lev’s cry is too late, Breit’s demon The crystal has sent out a bolt of lightning, enough to turn gold into a piece of coke lightning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;End<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;postscript<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Here, I will introduce you to the lost God of the mainland. God who lost the continent has several factions. Headed by the god of light, the god of justice, the god of order, the god of vengeance, the god of life and healing, and so on, constitute the school of justice. The thirteen gods, including the god of darkness, the god of destruction, the god of deception, the god of disease, etc., constitute the evil faction. The Elf King of each natural element forms a neutral faction. The six death gods headed by Pluto are self-contained. There are also three chaos gods who are free to act as they wish. The gods do not fight directly. They try to promote their own set in the human world to prove that the opponent's beliefs are wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
