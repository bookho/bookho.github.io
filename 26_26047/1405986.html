			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 01<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elna looks at the opponent in front of him, his expression looks very Serious, he is posing the most common posture of the warrior: the sword is lifted over the head with both hands, the sword is tilted to the right, the tip of the sword is backward, and the hilt is forward. He is waiting for Elna's attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would you like a hit? Well, as long as he doesn't use the power of the magic sword, the chances of my victory will increase. He is now trying to get a blow, as long as I can escape this blow, the victory will be in my hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elna quickly rushed forward, in the eyes of the next person, she was already at full speed, but she did not actually give up all the power . This is also the purpose of Elna. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;come! Edward concentrated all the spirit, he grasped the speed of Elna, and took the dark wind at the most appropriate time. The audience screamed. In their view, Elna was in danger of escaping. At such a fast speed, her forehead will send her to the other's blade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alna also concentrated all the spirit and strength in this hit, she saw the sword of the opponent’s knees, as long as she continued to move forward, the sword Will just hit myself. But her purpose is to let the opponent attack the sword. Elna stopped her progress with a subtle footwork when the sword was shot. The opponent's sword was crossed in front of her and did not cause any harm to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Win! Elna attacked the black feathers with the fastest speed. His sword has not been recovered yet, and it is the best moment for the attack. Elna’s right hand hit a full blow, and its power combined with the compression of magical energy is enough to knock down an elephant. As long as this is the case, this man can’t stand up today, maybe in the next few days. Not up, even with the treatment of a therapist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone in the audience stared at the two fighting people. No one noticed that Wei’s eyes were very excited. He tried to yell, but his throat I couldn’t make a sound for a long time, so I didn’t cause anyone’s attention, even the partners around me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark wind cuts from the bottom right side of Elna, draws from the left shoulder, completely disintegrating Elna's full blow with a beautiful arc Elna’s body showed a huge wound from the right lower abdomen to the left shoulder, three inches deep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sharp-eyed person saw the wonderful hit of Black Feather: his first sword fell because Elna’s sudden stop, but he Instead of accepting the sword, it uses a good angle to let the dark wind collide with the ground. The rebound force generated by the collision of the long sword on the ground is back, the speed of the sword is doubled, and Elna is injured. This record is under the "Swallows Back to the Nest." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therapy that has been applied to the body for a long time has played a role. Although this is a fatal wound, there is no bleeding under the power of healing. Come. However, Elna also knows that it is absolutely impossible to deal with such serious injuries. The wound came like a soldering iron, and Elna could feel that her vitality was leaving her body bit by bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edward, while watching the opponent in front of him, panting, just a shot he spent a lot of mental and physical strength, starting with his sword, he I stopped my breath and prepared to fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the moment of life and death, the instinct defeated everything, and Erna offered her the strongest prayer to her goddess, the prayer she had vowed never to use. Text! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goddess accepted her request, a powerful force descended on Elna’s body, and the wound recovered quickly in a short period of time, just in Edward’s surprise In the eyes, the wound completely healed, and even a small scar did not remain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edward almost does not believe in his own eyes, is this woman not dead? Even such injuries can be ignored. However, he is still focused, waiting for the opponent's offense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Elna didn’t attack, she couldn’t fight anymore, the sword that was just cut her body and cut her The clothes were scratched and her clothes were almost divided into two halves. After the wound was restored, Elna used her arm to cover her chest, but the audience under the stage had enough time to admire her chest. For a time, the whistle sounded. As a woman, Elna has been unable to continue to stand on the stage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lev adjusted his expression to greet Elna. His saliva had almost flowed out, but when Elna stepped off, he went up and took Elna into the locker room, covering the audience. Look at the sight of Elna. Then Lev gave a look to Kim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold would like to, he used a moment of magic to come to the hotel where they lived and found a few pieces of Elna’s clothes (the original therapist of Elna) The robe fell on the dusty platform, it was dirty and couldn't be worn anymore. Then it was transferred back with magic. Just when Kim brought the clothes back, one thing was found. One of Erna’s black-side therapists had a bit of damage on the edge of the robe. In the broken place, Kim found the golden edge embroidered under the black side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edward stood in the ring, he is very happy now, but fortunately it is now an open competition in the ring, otherwise... but in any case, he wins A plate. Just as he was about to step down from the ring, there was a child behind him, "Stop!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black feathers turned back, a little girl in front of me. It seems that no more than ten years old, he remembered, this child is also a member of the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You bad guy, actually broke the clothes of Elna’s sister! It’s too odious. That dress is the favorite and the latest of Elna’s sister. I want to help you to teach Elna sister." Babe's heart is still very simple, she does not know the real blow to Elna. She just thinks that it is wrong to break the things that others love (clothes are also). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a strange dignity in the air, something that makes people feel suffocating, and a dangerous feeling comes to everyone's heart. Babe read a few words and there was a change in the ring. A huge body appeared in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A huge ice snake appeared on the ring, and its appearance brought a cold. This low-dimensional creature appears in this space under the call of the summoner. Its body is crystal clear, its eyes are red, and the letter is spitting in the air. This snake looks beautiful, a deadly beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Offensive!" With the sound of Babe, the ice snake attacked the man on the ring, it opened, the sharp cone of ice like a gun and enough The frozen air that turned into ice cubes poured into Edward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black feather jumped to the side, but the tail of the ice snake immediately ran into him. He used a sword in his hand, and the force of the impact was almost dark. The wind was split in half, and he was knocked back and retreated. The ice snake rushed to the unstable opponent. It opened its mouth and wanted to swallow the man. Its open mouth and sharp mouthful of ice proved that it had this ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although not very glorious, Edward made a roll on the ground and escaped from the snake kiss. The ground has already been iced, which makes the ice snake move more neat, but limits Edward's actions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, come on!" Encouraged by the owner, the ice snake launched another attack. Although it did not bite the opponent, it was enough to make the black feathers fly from the sky. "Become "full of ground." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Awesome Warcraft! If it is not in the ring now, I may be dead. Fortunately, this is a downfall, and the weak summoner is on the side of the mighty Warcraft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After once again escaped the snake kiss, Edward rushed to Babe, and the ice snake swept over its tail, seeing that it could not escape the blow, but Edward lay back on the ground, not only escaped this fierce sweep, but because of the ice, he slipped to the side of Babe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no need to use a sword, Edward kicked Babe down the kick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the stun of the summoner, the ice snake from the low dimension had no choice but to return to its own world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This short but thrilling battle is over, and thunderous applause is heard in the audience. One of the young women took a special shot, and even her father applauded this wonderful contest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We caught the fallen babe, Edward’s foot was just right, neither causing great damage to Babe and letting her faint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Elna came out, the battle was over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold saw the scene where Babe was kicked down. After ten minutes, the next battle will begin, and three of his own have been defeated. There is no confidence in defeating a swordsman-level warrior with a magic sword in the ring, and it is difficult for a thief and a warrior to be too strong. In fact, only Wei is alone, and there are still four fighters. Hands-on! It seems that there is no hope for winning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After ten minutes of rest, Black Feather stood on the ring again. As he expected, the one who came up with the face and the strength of the sword. As long as he can defeat him, the remaining magicians and thieves are not afraid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the referee announced the start of the game, the two fighters began a fierce battle, the two swords collided again and again, both sides seem to be evenly matched, Edward The speed is faster, and Wei's power is better than the other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s really strong! It’s a sword saint. I have to use two hands to cope with the strength of one hand. Although I am going faster, he is still wearing a heavy body armor. If he takes off the heavy old armor that is going to die, can I hold a few rounds in his hand? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sword of Wei’s hand is of extraordinary quality, in contact with the dark wind Did not suffer much damage. Wei is like a steady stone. He is slow to play fast, hard to break, and he is very calm. He seems to be dragging his time with his opponent, waiting for his opponent's physical exhaustion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a round of white-bladed war, Edward jumped back, and the two men opened the distance again. Edward gasped in the big mouth, but Wei Lian was angry. There is no spit (the strength of the monster wearing a 60 kilogram walk every day is really extraordinary). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this the power of Juggernaut? I have consumed a lot of physical strength, but he seems to have not even started warming up. His swordsmanship is calm and steady. The drip does not leak, and he doesn't seem to do his best at all. If I fight with a sword, I can't fight him at all." Edward touched the dark wind of love sword, and he struggled to save the dark wind power in the battle just now. Finally, there is a return. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Darkness" With the scream, Edward attacked again, and his opponent could not see anything now. In Edward's expectation, Wei will either use his vindictiveness to dispel the magical influence, or he will retreat, get out of contact with him, and wait for the past of magical effectiveness. If it is the former, then he will consume vindictiveness. If it is the latter, Edward will be able to catch up with his opponent and give him a surprise sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Wei learned a long time ago not relying on his own visual operations alone, he did not retreat or evade, but waved his sword, very Accurately blocked Edward's sniper, and then back to the other's chest. "Paralysis!" Edward turned away from Wei's spurs. The opponent was not affected by the dark wind force and did not let him eat a lot of surprise. After all, the opponent was a sword saint. He immediately applied the dark wind after pulling away the distance. A power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We feel a sense of paralysis spread to the whole body, his body can not do whatever he wants, if others will panic and use the gas to drive away the magic, but Wei This kind of paralyzed feeling is very familiar, even a little nostalgia, he is very clear how to use his own feelings left, although a little slow, but Wei easily escaped the other side of the sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edward is a bit overwhelmed. Is the opponent really immune to the dark wind? There are still other reasons. He stopped and carefully looked at his opponent's armor. After careful observation, he determined that it was just an ordinary old-fashioned full body, and absolutely no magic was attached to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Slow! Aggravated!" Edward yelled, he did not believe that the power of the dark wind was ineffective for the man in front of him, and he used two dark winds in one breath. The magic, although it consumes more with the power of two magical dark winds, but he has not considered so much, he urgently needs to confirm whether the opponent is immune to magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air around Wei is full of magical power, hindering his actions, and his weight suddenly increases several times, even Wei, There is no guarantee that you can escape your opponent's attack in such a state. He finally gave up his anger. The air and the earth's bondage to him was immediately blown away by the vindictive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edward confirmed that his opponent was not immune to magic, and his confidence rose. He knew that a protracted war was against him. He was determined to make quick decisions and use the dark wind. Magic and his own swordsman defeated the opponent in one fell swoop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Coagulation!" Edward showed the most powerful magic of the dark wind, and it was also the most expensive magic, and then he was fully prepared, and he had to fight after the opponent’s vindictiveness. Instantly launch an attack, and when the defense is weakest, the attack is successful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new bond caught Wei, the space around him was full of the power of the dark wind, this magical force bound him at the level of space, let He can't act, no matter how much effort he uses to break free. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei Weiqiang escaped sideways, but Edward would not let this opportunity out. He and Wei’s full attention were concentrated on the dark wind. He flew up and hit Wei’s head. Although there is a helmet protection, the impact of this foot is enough to make Wei's mind dizzy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This feeling, right, is the feeling. Wei’s attack reminded him of a scene he wanted to forget but always remember. In an instant, Wei’s thoughts drifted into the distant past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei is not in the ring, but in the huge cave with the name of "The Nest of the Devil", it is not the "black feather" Edward, but That hateful eight-eyed demon. Wei and the devil are confrontational. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Eight-Eyed Devil is staring at Wei with his four remaining eyes, and the remaining four eyes are only four eyes are dripping blood-- This is the result of Wei’s first round of attacks. Wei never knew that the demon blood and human beings were the same red. Just now, Wei flashed the attack of the devil's blade-like claws, but the devil hit the head with his tail. Although it was wiped, it was enough to make him feel dizzy. Of course, Wei’s long sword added a scar to the devil’s tail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One person and one devil have been fighting for five hours. The current situation seems to be very beneficial to Wei. There is not much wound in Wei, and the size of the devil. There are already hundreds of wounds. But the devil did not seem to care about the wounds on his body. He gave a scream, and Wei Quan was alert, because he knew that the devil would launch the next round of attacks. Edward continued to expand the battle immediately after he succeeded. When he was dizzy, he used the dark wind to stab Wei's flanks, the most unpreparable part of a dizzy person. Edward believed that the dark wind could easily penetrate the opponent. Vintage body squats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Edward attacked Wei, he suddenly discovered that Wei’s eyes were congested by anger and hatred, showing a dangerous red color, and his instincts told him The danger is coming, and Edward gave up the attack and jumped back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei’s body gave out a strong vindictive power, and the power of the audience was so close to the audience that the face was like a knife. If Edward did not leave far behind, he would be smashed into pieces and the bones would be lost. As early as in the previous battle, a new wound was added to the awkward platform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edward sees the power of vindictiveness, he has a higher evaluation of Wei’s power, and the opponent in front of him is not the kind of person who has just mastered vindictiveness, but A warrior who can control the power of liberty freely, he can give a weak temper to fight against magic, and can also give a strong vindictiveness to kill the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This guy is definitely not a silent person. People who have this power will never come out suddenly. He masked his true face with a mask and used his armor to hide his body. What is it for? He and such a group of partners must have his own purpose to participate in the contest. In all likelihood, which country is sent to engage in some kind of ulterior. I really want to uncover his mask and see where he is sacred. Is it sent to deal with me specifically... But as long as there is a dark wind in hand, I have confidence to be high and low with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei finally returned to reality, if I didn’t feel anything about my opponent before In the words, Wei is now full of dislike for Edward. If it weren't for his foot, he wouldn't have to think back to that scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We rushed to the opponent in anger, he has switched to two hand-held swords, this is his first active attack in this battle, he is no longer Retain, you have to show your full strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edward originally wanted to use the power of the dark wind, but just after the impact of grudge, the dark wind has not recovered, he only has to fight with all his strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time the collision of the two swords made Edward's hand numb, he could barely hold the dark wind. At the same time, the dark wind is also screaming, and Wei slams his temper on the sword, and every time he is hurting the elves who are in the dark wind. Edward’s plan to delay the waiting for the recovery of the dark wind force went bankrupt, and he only had to support it. Now the field has completely become Wei's world. He has a sword and another sword's attack, and his opponent is forced to retreat. Wei's huge wrist force made Edward lose the chance to fight back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We used a slam to forcefully break the opponent’s defense. Under this powerful blow, the black feathers were separated by the shock, and he was completely exposed to the opponent. Under the sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first time in the contest, "Black Feather" Edward was actually knocked down on the ground for the first time, and he was knocked down to the ground by his opponent for the first time since he was a teacher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mimiya Princess looked at this scene, she prayed to all the gods she knew. On the other hand, there was not much happiness in the face of the Emperor Nikolai. He was originally a good man, and this wonderful dragon battle attracted him deeply. He forgot that the man who was knocked down to the ground was a bastard who wanted to steal his daughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can the head hurt so much, how can it be so ice on the face? What is this place? Hey, the temple on the right is going to die, what is going on? Something appeared in the beginning of the blur, and then became more and more clear, this is a pair of iron boots, a pair of old style boots, worn on a man's feet. My face is lying on the ground, and some ice on the ground is not melting. The pain in the temple is getting stronger and stronger, but the mind begins to clear and the memory begins to recover. By the way, I am now competing in the contest, I was just knocked down by the strange opponent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei looked at the opponent at the foot, Edward began to move a little. The referee is counting from now, and now counts to 20, and as long as the number is still up to 100, Edward is determined to faint, and Wei won the game. When the number of referees reached 50, the man who fell to the ground turned over and the referee announced that the game would continue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 03<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Although the pain in the temple is still the same, but the mind is already awake, the scene where the opponent used his irresistible force to forcefully defeat his defense, and then knocked himself down on the platform with the hilt has been completely remembered. Now the opponent is standing there, looking at himself and waiting for himself to stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s awful, how can you not beat the strong enemy in front of you? The person who stood on the side and looked at the opponent who fell to the ground has always been me! Is it so defeated? I almost lost the will to continue fighting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melia, there is a name in my mind, yes, it is Melia! The hand touched a thing on the chest, the pointed thing, did not go to see, I knew what it was, this is Melia gave it to me, no, it was the diamond pin that was loaned to me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This pin is the relic of Melia’s mother and has a special meaning. Melia gave it to me. She hoped that I would get the first place and return the diamond pin to her. Courage returned to my heart, and I remembered the words of my adoptive father. "If you want to get something, you can only fight for it by yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right, it’s A chance to seize happiness with one's own hand, as long as victory is achieved, Melia's father, Emperor Nicholas, will recognize my relationship with her. I grabbed the pin of my chest tightly, courage and fighting spirits were uploaded from the pins and spread through the arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Melia, in order to win, for my future happiness, I am determined to fight and challenge this powerful, almost invincible Juggernaut. Either win or die. There is no other way in front of me. If you choose to retreat, give up and merge with Melia, and steal, I would rather die here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Black Feather" Edward stood up from the ground, he liked every life Like the person who is entrusted to something, the hand is holding the dark wind of the sword. The dark wind feels the master's determination and strength, and it responds to the master's determination with a tremor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dark wind, don't disappoint me," Edward said in a sword in the opponent's voice that no one can hear. "I have entrusted everything. You are on the body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark wind is more intense, it is also expressing its determination to the master, the heart and the sword are connected, and all have a death The determination of the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Black Feather" Edward looked up at his opponent. He has thrown everything away and is fearless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are back in a few steps and set a full defense. Although he faced only an opponent who had just stood up and was weak, he did not dare to underestimate the enemy. He is too familiar with this look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have experienced countless battles and he has seen this kind of look. This is the look of the warriors who gamble everything, including honor, life, and happiness. Wei knows how dangerous it is to have such a look. Although this is only a game, but since the opponent shows such a look, then he must have a reason not to lose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edward raised his sword and he pressed everything on the hit. He shouted "Coagulation!" and rushed to his opponent. The dark wind understood the master's mind, and it released all the remaining power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei was immediately bound by the power of space, and he looked at his opponent and rushed to release his vindictiveness and liberate himself from bondage. But this time different times, the magical power around Wei is too strong, Wei's vindictiveness is not enough to dispel the magic, and the vindictiveness disappears, and the magic re-limits Wei's actions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We immediately released the second wave of vindictiveness, but it was too late, and when Wei’s vindictiveness broke out from the body, the dark wind was already in the body. In spite of the danger of being hurt by vindictiveness, Edward slashed the dark wind against the face of Wei's mask at the maximum speed he could reach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the sword stabbed into the body, the vindictiveness broke out. Wei regained his magic when he was driving the magic, that is, when the dark wind pierced the mask, he regained his freedom. In the final time, he turned his head and escaped the crisis of the long sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vindictively blows Edward away, but does not cause harm to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a crisp crack, Wei's mask fell to the ground, and the audience saw the true face of Wei. This masked man is not the one they guessed. His youth is almost incompatible with the strength of his Juggernaut. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a scar on Wei’s face that is bleeding. It is the damage caused by the dark wind. Although he has escaped the brain-breaking crisis, the dark wind still gives He caused a lot of damage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei’s head suffered a lot of damage, and the blood fell from the wound on his forehead to the platform, and the blood flowed into his eyes, obstructing His sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is falling on the ground, it is reflecting the sun, this is... this is my mask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We touched my face with my hand, of course, there is nothing on my face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My mask is broken! My mask is broken! Wei fell into anger, and this ordinary iron mask has a special meaning for Wei. This is the last piece of contact between him and his hometown of destruction. Wei still remembers how he got the mask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wei, stand up, this is not very heavy, you still "Come on."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher, why do you see through my attack. My movements are not yet skilled. It hurts!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your movements are already very skilled. The trap you just set is very good. It leads me to a fixed reaction with a regular attack, and then an unexpected attack."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But, teacher, this is useless, have you not easily seen through my attack?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" That's because your face sold you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My face sold me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Yes! Your expression is too rich. Every time you make a regular attack, you will show a sly smile. When you launch a sudden attack, your face is full of happy expressions that will come soon. I can see through your trap and put You defeated."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, come here. Wei, now you are getting stronger, even I can't win you." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher, I have a question, why can't I beat you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Wei, your speed and strength have surpassed me. You have also learned to observe your opponent in battle. Judging from his opponent's subtle expressions and eyes, his next move is me. You can also grasp the smallest clues. To infer my next move. You are impeccable, but your expression is too rich. Even if my current eyesight is not good, I can easily read your heart from your face."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes? It seems that it is beyond the scope of your ability to be unspoken in battle! Now it has become your biggest weakness. You must find a way to remedy it. Yes, I have a good thing, you I am coming!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is...mask?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, this is the teacher Something I used at a young age, but now it is useless to me. Now I will give it to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Thank you teacher, in the future, as long as I wear it in the battle, no one can see my expression. My combat skills are perfect. Great."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Stupid, this thing is not so useful. You have to wear it every day, so that in your life, the expression on your face becomes useless. Only then can you get rid of the weakness of the expression too rich. The enemy will not give you time to wear a mask. But take off the mask for a while every day, lest you become expressionless. Do you know?"< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abominable, actually destroyed my important mask, in Wei’s heart, anger Unstoppable, he loves this mask very much. This is the gift that his most beloved teacher gave him. Since he got the mask, he never let it leave his side. After leaving his hometown, every time he touches the mo mask, he will remind him of the happy time when he was young. But now, the mask is destroyed by this damn guy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A wave of anger, Wei found that things are not right, but it is too late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edward stood on one side, his previous blow used up the dark wind and almost all his strength, he did not know if this blow is enough to defeat the opponent Now I am observing my opponent's reaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are standing down, terrible murderousness is coming out of his body, murderous and full of anger and bitter hatred, if not seen by the eyes, really not I believe that human beings will release such murderousness. Everyone on the Kaige Square was stunned by this murderous heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We looked up, and Edward and Edward’s audience could see what was in his bloody eyes that had not been called “rational”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 04<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation on the field has changed again, each one feels a little bit The audience knows that Wei in the arena is crazy. Just now, everyone thought that the sword that was straight on the eyebrows was enough to defeat Wei, but the effect was counterproductive. This sword only completely angered Wei. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Kill him! Kill him! Kill him!" The voice was kept in the bottom of my heart. Wei’s rational thoughts to control his last glimmer of effort collapsed in this cry. The thirst for blood and the urge to kill control the body of Wei. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of Wei, "Black Feather" Edward can feel the danger without intuition. This murder is so powerful, even like him. People who have lived in bloody mercenaries have never seen them. He knew he was going to face a crazy beast. There is no retreat, and his opponent is no longer the kind of person who will let him down if he admits. He must fight for honor and life. Edward took a deep breath and exhaled all the distractions. He clung to the dark wind, set his posture and prepared to face the upcoming attack frenzy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei Chong came up with ten times the speed and a hundred times of madness. Wei’s hands clasped his long sword, and he wanted to smash the hateful guy in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just a collision, the hands clenching the dark wind are shaken off, but this time Wei will not use the hilt again, he will undoubtedly put Edward Give one and two halves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silent audience sent an exclamation, and a woman could not face the upcoming scene, she passed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her father sat on the side and looked indifferent. No, he was actually very excited. His hands clasped the railings, and the grips were so tight. Even these rather solid carved decorative railings were slightly cracked by his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the downfall, Wei’s three companions were watching nervously, and almost no one noticed that the little girl who had passed out had woke up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crying into the ear, Wei’s body shook, and the sword that was about to fall in his hand also won a meal. Edward took the opportunity to jump back, while the long sword falsified a few times to stop the opponent's pursuit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Wei did not pursue, crying made his bloodthirsty passion cold. He has recovered his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am madman?" Wei said to himself, "I still can't control my emotions very well! Teacher, if you are still If I have to, I must be embarrassed again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei lifted the sword, this game has been dragged on for too long, now is the end of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edward stood on one side, almost unable to hold the sword with both hands, and the power of the mad warrior Wei could not be inferred by common sense. The impact just made his wrist sprained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strength of a sword is great! Although I want to remove this shot at a suitable angle, even if the opponent is really amazing! He changed his direction at the moment of his knees, and in the direction of his own parry, he did not even remove the power, and he sustained the blow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Wei once again rushed over, Edward also raised the sword "I can't lose!" A voice yelled in his heart, "for Miri Ya, I can't lose!", he knows that this is the last blow. If this sword can't beat the opponent, his wrist can no longer lift the sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei Chong came up, it seems very slow, but it is very fast. He keeps the rest except the foot moving at high speed, giving the illusion of slow movement. . He keenly saw that his opponent's wrist was a little trembling, and he knew what was going on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edward stopped breathing, the moment of contact between the two came, the sword was cut down by the pressure of Mount Tai, and he pretended to resist. Just before the two swords touched, his body moved to the left and removed himself from the other's sword. Although the dark wind touched Wei's sword, but he could not open backwards, Wei's sword An empty, and the dark wind also turned into a hilt forward, the front of the sword front. Edward grasped the moment after the other side's hollowing out, and slammed into the wound on Wei's forehead with the dark wind's hilt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This originally perfect trap didn’t work in front of Wei. Wei had already seen the whole plan from his opponent’s face. When the sword was hollowed out, he Throwing away the sword, he grabbed the other's wrist with his hand. With a little force, the dark wind fell from Edward's hand. Wei used a left hook to hit the opponent's face (the whole body armor was attached to the iron gloves). ), Edward was hit by this blow, fell outside the ring, and stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the moment of flying out, Edward’s mind appeared in the scene when his father taught him to practice his sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Edward, what do you mean to beat me today? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Call, call, call, not finished yet! Look at the sword!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The adoptive father waved his hand, and Edward’s practice flew away from his hand with a long sword, but Edward did not admit defeat. He continued to rush and wanted to use a hook to fall the adoptive father, but his strength was too small. It is impossible to move a tall and healthy adoptive father. The adoptive father grabbed this Edward's collar with only one hand and lifted him up. Edward only waved his hands and feet in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father raised Edward to the ground and said to him, "Edward, I am going to teach you something now, you remember me, what determination? Desperately, things like this are not very useful in combat. Even if they are useful, they are in a situation where the power is not much different. In combat, only speed, strength, skill and luck determine the outcome. If you are determined, If you win, there will be no failure in the world. Don’t have too much determination in the future, but have enough practice, understand?!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, sure enough, how much determination and courage can't fill the difference in combat power, this time I was completely defeated. Sorry, Melia, I still disappointed you, maybe I am really useless, forgive me, Melia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Black Feather" Edward was in a coma, and he held a tight grip on his hand, the diamond pin that he pulled from his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei stood in the ring and he made a gesture to the referee, saying that he could face the next challenger immediately, without a ten-minute break. But this action is superfluous, because except for Edward, the remaining four are not true entrants, they are all Edward's friends, in fact, just to make up the number. After witnessing the power of Wei, the rest of the people knew the disparity in power between the two sides. They all said that they had conceded defeat and gave up the game. The referee announced the victory of the six-person team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the audience, Melia has woke up, she just saw her lover being beaten down by the opponent, lying under the ring, not moving She couldn't take care of the maids and guards, and used her fastest speed to leave the royal seat and ran to Edward's position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the ring, the referee announced that the game ended this morning and the audience began to leave. There was a discussion of the competition just now. After Wei’s true face, speculation and rumors not only did not decrease, but also increased significantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The audience did not spend too much time on the scene, except for some cleaning people, there were not many people in the Kaige Square soon. There are of course exceptions. At one point in the square, a whole team of Deer Royal Guards is embracing a middle-aged man to the place as a player's lounge. At the door, the emperor made a gesture, except for his personal guards, the other guards stayed outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nikolay walked into the room, his sweetest daughter was inside, sitting next to a lying man, seeing this scene, Nikola’s heart There is gas. This man is nothing. He is just a mercenary. He wants to serve his daughter. She is a princess! Edward hasn't woken up yet, but he hasn't suffered any serious damage. The therapist has cured his sprained wrist and a small injury on his head (handled). Wei’s punch was so weird that it didn’t hurt him but it was enough to stun him for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Melia, let's go! What are you doing here? Is this incompetent guy not worthy of you to like him? He is not worthy of him! He Even such a game can't win, I have given him a chance, but he didn't grasp it, it was a waste!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, Dad, he is not Waste, if it weren't for this damn game rule, he would have been able to win. If it weren't for the wheel battle, no one would beat him!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Emperor This man was defeated after defeating three opponents, and all three opponents are strong enemies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In any case, since he can't win, you can't go with him anymore, come!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three female soldiers came in and forced her away, regardless of Melia's resistance. "As long as Melia is calm for a while, she will forget this bastard!" The emperor deceived himself and comforted himself. He did not dare to order the killing of Edward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 05<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the afternoon is going to be refurbished, there is no match, the winner of today’s game They are all in the hotel now. But they also did not have the heart to celebrate this hard-won victory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei’s most beloved mask is broken, he is now looking at the fragments of the mask, of course, stinking a face. Behan’s mood is even worse. It’s not a pleasant experience to be pierced by a sword. Elna’s mood is not good enough. Today’s “showing light” has made her still sorrowful. Only Babe became alive and kicking as soon as the pain disappeared. In this way, six people spent a dull afternoon. At dusk, in order to be active, Lev proposed to go to the hotel to drink, others reluctantly agreed. This proposal, everyone set off, even Babe also went together, because she must sneak on the shoulders of the "big brother". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people in the city of DeLand are so many, as if to compensate for the scene of no one in the city during the day, in the evening, there are people everywhere, except Wei Wei In addition to wearing his body, other people have changed, and they have not been recognized as the daytime warriors. In order to take care of Behan, everyone went very slowly. Although the wounds on Behan’s stomach healed (all of them had a therapist in their ranks), they still felt a little painful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The six people walked into a fairly ordinary tavern, and the tavern had quite a few guests, but there were still a few tables empty. Five people sat down around a table, and Babe sat on Wei's knee. Sometimes Kim really can't understand this little girl. It turns out that she is most afraid of Wei, but now she is most intimate with Wei. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wine is a very magical thing. After a few cups, everyone’s mood turned better, and even Wei’s face turned cloudy and sunny. The mood is good, and the words are more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elna, why did you first participate in this contest?" Lev asked questions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this? To be honest, I really don't know. It was Behan who suddenly proposed to attend this contest because there is no other." I also agreed, Wei also acquiesced."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone turned their eyes to Wei’s face, Wei also nodded and then turned to the line of sight Behan's face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behan’s face already has a bit of wine, he said: “Participating in the contest is just a moment of my rise. It was quite boring at the time, just to see the mainland. The latest news sheet has the news that the Delante Empire held the contest. I want to try it. I still have a little confidence in my own skills. I was only one person to compete. I didn’t expect this to be a team competition. Hey, if it’s not Wei, we’re planted in the hands of the 'black feather’ today.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Oh! So, you are not for that six pieces. What are the treasures?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Treasures? I don't even know which pieces of treasures are there!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't know? The six treasures were taken from the treasury of Delante. The most precious ones are two. One is the legendary Great Magister's Light* Magic (in legend, The Holy Light* magic is one of the greatest heroes of the lost man on the mainland. He led the "liberation war" and united all of them. In the same way, against the rule of the higher goblins, the "Blood Lake Battle", which was named after the blood of both sides in a battle between the two sides, defeated the army of the high spirits. Mankind became the most powerful race on the continent. After the War of Liberation, the ruler established the magical power was named after him.) My magic book, followed by the demon sword made by the ancient goblins and demons in ancient times. Under the temptation of 'The Holy Light's Magic Book', even the magicians dare to venture into the ring to fight with the soldiers. The magic sword is the treasure that the soldiers pursue. If there are not these two treasures, there is not much. People will come to participate in this contest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden eyes suddenly light up, Wei is the same, but they think completely differently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shengguang* Magic's own magic book! ! ! The legendary big magister! ! ! The leader class overthrew the ruler of the high leprechaun! The most powerful magician ever, is considered to have a man second only to the power of God! ! ! His handwritten magic book! ! ! Just thinking, Kim feels full of blood. This is the treasure that all magicians dream of! ! ! Decided, no matter what, even if I want to go to the duel with Juggernaut, I have to get this book, and Kim is determined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sword that the high spirits cast in order to fight the demon! ! ! There must be enough power on the sword to destroy the demon. As long as you hold it, you can defeat the Eight-Eyed Devil and revenge for your loved ones! ! ! Wei’s mood was like a fallen man grabbing a piece of wood. Originally thought that the road to revenge in the distant future suddenly appeared a shortcut, Wei excited all the body to tremble. Wei Momo read the name of each relative. He swears in the name of his deceased relatives that he must get the weapon no matter what method he uses and avenge himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why should the Durant Empire take these precious things out for prizes?" Elna raised a very important question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is, no one will suspect too much treasure, no place to put it?" Behan made a sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't know? These treasures are all chicken ribs! Take the magic book, so far, all the magicians of the Durant Empire can't see Understand what is written above. Of course, there is no way to use it. It is better to use it as a prize! The same is true of the sword. Although it has the power to destroy the devil, no one knows how to exert this power. As a result, it The power of even the human magic sword can not match." Lev is a knowledgeable look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this bucket of cold water is not enough to quench the enthusiasm of Wei and Kim. It doesn't matter, even if I don't understand it, my teacher will definitely understand it! Just let him translate for me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It doesn't matter, just try it slowly and you will find the way to use it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
