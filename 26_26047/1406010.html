			<div id="content">With his eyes wide open, in such a short period of time, he knew so many things that he had never heard before, and he could hardly completely digest the things that came out of the mouth of Nobis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You mean, there is a magician who is more powerful than the Holy Light...but I heard about the Light..." Nubis made a gesture. Signal gold not to talk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Having my teacher is the luck of that era, and being born in that era is the misfortune of my teacher! You can imagine it, one The magician, but he has no time to delve into the magic, but to run around for politics all day, which is a kind of sorrow for a magician. Although he has almost all the knowledge of the ancestors, he has no time. To study and create magic! He once said to me that when he finally gets rid of the rule of the high leprechaun, he must forget everything, except for magic, he does not care about it... but when one person bears other people When he has all the ardent hopes, he can't do it himself... If he was born in a peaceful era, maybe in terms of magic, he can achieve even greater achievements, perhaps reaching the level of the unknown magician. ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What did the nameless magician do? You can get this kind of evaluation - I mean what you said, the gods Unable Heng '- I mean, how a human could get such an evaluation, he in the end who is the "gold already own irrepressible curiosity?. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know, no one knows his name, no one knows where he came from, and finally where he went! His name has been forgotten In the dust of history, we only know that he has great power! In the recorded records, this magician holds the enormous magic and the righteousness. He can freely control the power of the elves, freely manipulate time and space, and can arrive. Various worlds where life cannot reach... There is even reason to suspect that this mage is actually the avatar of the god of chaos!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know the story about the devil? ?" The Necromancer suddenly asked for a question. "The king of the demon, the horrible creature that once brought the shadow of destruction to the world!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold looks for information about the demon in memory, then he remembers the old Locke told him something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The three devils who were defeated by the higher goblins..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Being a high leprechaun Beating..." Nubis smiled and scorned, and then he said to himself, "This is like human beings. When writing history, you can only write down records that are good for you... Hey!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You mean..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know that after defeating the high leprechaun, we I have seized a lot of documents and books that they have left behind - Pluto Island has saved a lot of these things - I found a lot of things that no one knows, some of which record something completely different from the formal history... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is the combination of the various races that defeated the devil, but the dominant high-level goblins have erased these heroic warriors in historical books!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Participate in that tragic The battle is the seven warriors, although three of them are high fairies, but there is also a half-orc, a winged man, a tauren... and, a human!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Human? But..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Seven Warriors...Yes, seven, and that human being is the leader of the warriors, and from In that battle, only the Tauren and the human being returned!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I heard that all the seven warriors died in heroic battle... You mean, that human being is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nubis nodded, "If my inference is not wrong, the mysterious human, that The unsung hero who led the Warriors and the Devils is the unnamed mage! There are several ancient books that record not only the high-level goblins who participated in the battle, but only one of the most incomplete books, this one is the most Basic description!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nubis issued Laughter, "higher fairy Fortunately, no human erase history so thoroughly, otherwise it really have nothing handed down, these heroic deeds of the brave, and it was buried in the dust of history! ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobis smiled softly. "However, this is only my personal inference. There is no evidence that these two people are the same person... Perhaps the brave who defeated the devil is only the human being who had the power of the former unnamed mage. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold suddenly found a huge loophole in the words of Nubis, a basic loophole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, since there is no way to be sure that the brave and the unnamed mage are one person, how to determine the existence of the unnamed mage, say so long, you seem to Didn't mention that he has done anything worthy of a name in history?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, he did one thing, one made him There is something that can't be erased. He left a magic book, a magic book that my teacher got!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Magic book?" At this moment, Kim suddenly remembered the magic book he had opened when he was in the city of Delante. Now the gold still remembers that feeling. In fact, the experience is hard to forget! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The book has been inherited for a long time, but only my teacher has the ability to unravel the above prohibition, which records unimaginable knowledge and power... ...the method of reversing time and space, the record of the unknown world, the mystery of the soul and the flesh - it is simply impossible to imagine that there was once a human being - perhaps not a human being - able to reach this realm... that is simply the realm of God..." Nubian Si closed his eyes, he was deeply immersed in the memories, it seems that everything has returned to the past, he is just the young impulsive magician, listening to the teacher telling him what is recorded in the magic book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A magic book with a ban?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From the book, we Even got the power to defeat the high spirits..." Nubis said this in a voice that only he could hear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cavalry team stopped and the team that was discharged was so neat, fundamentally Unlike a bunch of robbers, the bodyguards have already picked up their weapons and put up a posture to fight. But the caravan has no advantage in both quantity and appearance. This is about a hundred cavalry with uniform armor and weapons. They are obviously not a group of rabble, and an officer-like person rushes out of the ranks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are you?" The coat of arms on his body can be seen very clearly. Adding other things, it can be inferred that this is a patrol. The task of the army, not the robbers - looks like a patrol unit sent for nearby security issues, but already has the ability to strike against any bandit group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bodyguards have seen this, some of them have even begun to put up their weapons, but the old businessman who was around Wei suddenly stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who are you, I know that there are only a few militia groups in the nearby towns, there are no professional soldiers at all? Are you mercenaries?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are the army of Didi Weicheng, now I order you to stop and accept the inspection!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nonsense, Didi Weicheng is still far away from here. It is necessary to cross the entire cursed desert before entering the territory of Didi Weicheng. Who are you?” The old businessman said loudly, but it seems that he is not enough, if the other party is really If the bandit of the army is faked, his caravan is probably not an opponent. The fighting power of the two sides is about one to three, and there is not much chance of winning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From a week ago, the twelve cities in the north of the cursed desert were all the territory of our lords. Our lords accepted the protection requirements of these cities, now you Already entered his territory and must be inspected!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old businessman sweats on his head, he knows the value of his shipment, it is hard to say that these soldiers see What kind of actions will be made by these goods? For this sale, he has accompanied all the family members. Now he only regrets why he wants to save money. He does not call some bodyguards - for the value of this goods, find one. The protection of the entire army of mercenaries is also worthwhile - "I don't believe, you have no right to search my goods!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See the attitude of the employer, bodyguards They have renewed their vigilance, and they can guess the value of some of these goods (although these things are worth more than they think), they can also see the concerns of the merchants. After all, people will see the money, And, if you really plan to do this, These soldiers should not leave any live on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the real bandit, the number is more than 500 people, it seems that the bandits also got the news of this goods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two sides immediately gave up the opposition, and now there are common enemies, both sides must deal with the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feather arrows fly in the air, on the wave of bows and arrows, the bandits have suffered a big loss, the patrol equipment is of high quality The bow dominated the range, while the bodyguards hid behind the van and used the lorry as a barrier to shoot the arrows. The bandits that rushed to the front were shot down and then stepped into the mud by the camel of the companion. But this does not stop these desperate people who have been bought by money. They ignore the companions who fell in sorrow and continue to storm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bandit lost about 50 people, but the distance between the two sides is no longer suitable for the use of bows and arrows. The commander ordered the soldiers to shoot the last wave of bows and arrows. Then put away the longbow, pull out their swords, and prepare for melee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enemy rushed over and the patrol greeted the standard square Although the bandits are not as well trained as these soldiers, they are also fierce and the number is absolutely superior. In the recent bow and arrow battle, the gangsters lost a lot. After all, for the bandits, the accurate archery while driving the mount is not their specialty, but in this melee, their combat power is not much worse than these soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a short and fierce battle, the two armies fought together, and the camel's advantage over the horse prevented the cavalry from maintaining their formation. What I can rely on now is only the personal training of the individual. Fortunately, however, most of the gangsters are not good at riding awkward camels, many people jumped off the mount and walked, which largely offset the advantage of the camel. In the battle, some of the gangsters got out of the battle, and rushed over to the carriage (grab the thing is their purpose), and the bodyguards have already entered the battle. Unlike the military, these bodyguards are mostly mercenaries and adventurers. They are almost all good at individual combat or small group battles. They are all experienced and know how to fight in this situation, unless the enemy rushes. Going to the side, otherwise no one is stupid enough to pull up the sword and rush to go up. The formation of various long-range weapons makes the scattered rushing desperate ones fall down one by one. The bodyguards suffered almost no casualties, and those who wanted to rush to grab a piece of cake were stumbled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that they are not a group!", looking at the battle, Lev made a conclusion - of course, speaking did not affect his shortness to himself The bow adds a new arrow - it seems that these bandits are a group formed temporarily for a common goal, no wonder there are so many people. Some of them are fighting hard and sincerely, and they plan to kill people and then grab the goods. Others want to fish in the water and fish more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Kill, everyone kills, wait for the most people who can kill more than one!" A face with a beard, a big axe in his hand The seemingly fierce bandits are trying to inspire their companions and at first glance look like a leader. He rode a camel and yelled and rushed over to a soldier who had cut down one of his associates. The huge axe crouched down and smashed the shield that the soldier lifted like a broken egg shell. He took a shoulder-length arm and the soldier fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you have these soft-footed shrimps, you will be unlucky to meet the uncle!" The leader turned and attacked another warrior who was fighting, compared with other gangsters. His approach to riding the mount was very clever, the camel turned flexibly, and the heel was precisely stepped on the face of the unfortunate warrior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The officer - the former captain - noticed this particularly conspicuous enemy, too many enemies, even if he can win this battle, It must also pay a huge price, but if you can kill this leader - it seems that he is the leader of this group - these rabble should be immediately fleeing...<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The officer of the army rushed to the bandit leader, using his sword to kill a bloody way in the enemy group, straight to the shackles that are slamming the army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are you?" The horseshoe, together with the screaming voice, let the bandit’s leader turn his attention and he saw that a cavalry had been rushing. When I got to my side, his clothes were dressed and the style of armor was different from that of ordinary soldiers. It was obviously an officer. The speed of the horse was very fast. It is hard to imagine how to accelerate to this point in this kind of melee. The long sword and the axe made the first collision, the sparks shot, the horses swept past the camel, and it seemed that no one was taking a little cheap, but the officer’s heart was secretly surprised, and the power generated by the speed of the horse’s sprint actually I was blocked by my opponent, and... my hand felt numb, and there was a sharp pain, and the joints must have been sprained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Squadron leader North!" The officer reported his name. After all, he was new. So he never heard of the other person's name, so the shock he felt was far less than the businessmen and bodyguards in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, it’s the murderer Rakker!" The old businessman hiding in the safest rear felt a chill, and the name Rakael was here. The cursed desert is very loud, loud to any desert city with his reward notice, the least bounty has 100 diamonds. All merchants or bodyguards who come and go on this business route know the existence of this name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't matter...should not lose...and the trump card, the trump card that was discovered by chance..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Quickly think about it!" The old man suddenly rushed to Wei's side. At this moment, Wei Zhengbiao stood by his companion. He turned and looked at the old businessman. He didn't know why he was so right. speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know yours, I saw you get the first place at the contest conference in DeLand City. With the strength of your Juggernaut, you should Can deal with that monster..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation of melee began to change, soldiers They started to gather slowly, and this kind of battle is more suitable for them, but in the same way, the pressure of the bodyguards fighting near the truck began to increase, and their bows and arrows are suitable for the scattered enemies, but when When the bandits began to organize and rushed over with the camels, the adventurers had no other choice. Only the sword was the only way to fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-hour battle has caused the bandit to lose a lot of manpower, especially those who plan to grab the goods first, but the rest are better disciplined and more combative. Some, and they still have enough people - for the bandits who have passed the blood of the knife, this level of loss is very good, because people who divide things can be less. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the real key to this battle has become a confrontation between the two leaders, whether it is Rachel or North, the defeat of either of them Death will lead to the collapse of their own troops, just because they think of this, so both people want to solve the problem immediately, so that the battle can be quickly ended. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "All let go, let Laozi give this guy a little color look!" With the confident voice of Rakael, his men were scattered. Not to stop the warrior who rushed over again, the North hand has changed a weapon. He is now holding a spear. When he returns to the horse, he knows that there is not much competition between the sword and the opponent’s axe. Winning, but with a long gun has a chance - look at the other side of the self-confident look, he should not dodge the frontal attack, this is also the key point of victory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is that? It’s a laugh! Inside the eyes, I saw the sneer of the other's mouth, and only the hunter who set the trap to wait for the prey to show the smile. In the next second, the opponent's hand made an empty-winged axe--no, not an empty swing, it was a trap. The combat experience over the years clearly tells that North is now in danger. He relies entirely on instinct. The spear in the handle of North is thrown away, and the horse is forced to fall off the horse. A strong sword wind cuts and divides the horse still moving forward into two halves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is it possible?" North climbed up from the ground and looked at the trace of the sword wind on the ground. The other party was able to use the battle axe to send out the sword. wind? Although the Jianfeng itself is a relatively superb skill, but... never seen this attack with an axe hair! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Awesome! Hahaha, I can hide from me!" Raquel made a creepy laugh, and then instigated the camel to his knees. I rushed over here, "but it's here, the people who can win me are still not born... Hahaha..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nos hastily Re-extracting the sword from the waist, set it, and concentrate on the next attack. However, when the sword was pulled, it was discovered that the sword had been broken in the sword. This is indeed a good sword, the damage of the first time. It has only been shown until now, but unfortunately chose the most inappropriate time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A black figure passes through the crowd - although most of the gangsters have forgotten the battle now, waiting for the victory of their leader, but the speed of this figure is indeed Soon, at this moment, almost there is almost an illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a young man wearing a full body, and it’s a young man in terms of age. , ...but this power... Does anyone really have this power? In order to block the axe's slash in the middle of the long sword, the strength of the arm and the weight of the axe and the momentum of the chopping, and the other side can actually block the sword with one hand, this kid's arm strength is really powerful, his own The hand almost couldn’t hold the axe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But confidence immediately returned to Rakker’s body, and countless battle experiences made him make a wrong judgment. "He wears this body armor... This should be because of the lack of combat experience and use the body armor to sacrifice the force to strengthen the defense. This kid should be just a natural power, not afraid, as long as he does not fight with him, he should be able to win. As long as you are careful, you won't lose!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But at this time Wei has already rushed up, and in the battle, walking is much more flexible than riding a camel. Wei shorted forward and cut a front leg of the unlucky camel with a sword. He had intended to rely on this trick to let the opponent fall, but his opponent was more flexible than he had imagined, and he had already jumped from the other side of the camel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are you?" Without saying that, Wei has already rushed up. He and the North are two kinds of people. He did not answer the robbers at all. The need for the problem, the speed of the forward speed allows the opponent to have no room for dodge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sword and the axe repeatedly attack in the air, Wei is a complete offensive and the opponent is completely defensive, the axe is inherently inflexible and heavy. Weapons, but in the hands of Rakaer, but the use of supernatural, this axe can actually flash softly, blocking each other's attack, but even so, he is still at a disadvantage. Like the incarnation of Pluto, the sword front sends out a thirst for life near every key of Rakael. Although it can always attack at the last moment, this kind of appearance is not going to last for a long time. The warriors know the truth, but now there is no gap that can be countered. How can the opponent's arm strength be outrageous? How can there be such strength? Whenever the weapon hits, the numbness caused by the vibration deprives Rake of the ability to counterattack. When the hand feels restored, the next attack comes. However, the opponent in front of him did not show a tired attitude at all. If you do not want to reverse this situation, failure is inevitable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fear of defeat and death finally defeated self-respect and honor, and Rakael held the battle axe with both hands to fight against the one-handed sword, in the weapon Push the Wei back after the next attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Up, give it to me!" After three seconds, the head of the head made his men understand, and the bandits shouted and rushed up to the two men. - Wei and North, who lost their weapons. But at this time the cavalry also rushed up, and the two armies reunited into a group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Abominable kid!" Inside the mouth, Rakaer licked his numb right hand and wanted to recover quickly. He was on the goods. Still not dead, after all, according to his intelligence, the caravan's goods are not ordinary value, as can be seen from the number of bodyguards. If it is just ordinary daily necessities or decorations, then no one has hired so many bodyguards! It seems that there are a lot of hard hands in the bodyguards. However, after all, the number of people is our advantage...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The human body is split, torn, interrupted by the sword light in front of it The idea of ​​Rakael, the black warrior broke through the obstacles of the crowd, rushed over here, in addition to the unfortunate ghosts who had no time to retreat, others dispersed, no one dared to stop in front of the soldiers who could not beat this leader. After cutting two or three cockroaches who didn’t know how to live and die, Wei once again approached the vicinity of Raquel, and the whole body armor made the gimmicks used for the calculations lose their effect. Now there are no people in front of these two people who can hinder Wei’s advancement. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give it to me!" Rakael yelled like this, but the men around him were a little cringe, after all, the man actually defeated (even if it was not defeated Take advantage of it) the leader who is considered by them to be invincible. A gangster greeted, but Wei's forward speed suddenly increased incredibly. The sudden change of speed made the opponent unable to react. His weapon was not lifted and was pierced by Wei Yijian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Awful, can't stop?" Raquel once again held the battle axe in both hands, ready to fight. Wei tightened his hand and pulled the sword from the unfortunate body. The sight of two people is coming together! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can... Damn!" In a flash, Rakael suddenly had an illusion, there was nothing around him, no his own subordinates, no other enemies. Only himself and this young warrior in front of him. What emerged from the soldier’s eyes was the death that he could not resist - the feeling was like being thrown in a cage with the same beast, and every cell in the body was telling the danger to the will, but the danger was Can't escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go to death!" The vindictive spurt came out, ignoring the nearby subordinates. This is the only chance for Rakker. If you can't beat this opponent, you can escape. This is the last choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black beast turned over a fight, but the steady landing, Wei’s vindictiveness also spewed out, although it was late, but it was enough, the two life energy mutual Offset the power, although Wei suffered a little impact, but suffered no harm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" The other party is also a sword-level warrior! The wrong estimate is the reason for this defeat. If you know it at the beginning, then there is enough time to escape, but now...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We rushed again, This time, I really did my best. The armor of my body suddenly lost weight at this moment. The strength of the enemy in front of him was higher than he expected. He did not need to save any strength. Moreover, there is no preservation power. What is the meaning, as long as the curse exists, he has unlimited physical strength, although this is the power of burning life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a cluster of life-like green plants popping up on the ground, entangled Wei’s feet (magic "thorns", magic of the earth), but vindictive The plant was rushed away in one shot, but Wei’s movements had been slowed down, giving his enemies a chance and taking out one thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone is retreating!" Rakaer shouted at the same time he threw out his hand. He knew that this battle was impossible to win, as long as there was this in front of him. The monster has no chance of victory, and the speed of Wei’s rush has caused him to lose his last fight. In an instant, the dance that almost made people's eyesight almost ineffective appeared in the middle of nowhere. It was impossible to pursue, because they couldn't see anything beyond one meter. All people could only hold weapons and guard, even Wei was no exception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic effect finally dissipated, the bandits have completely retreated according to the pre-arranged plan, leaving only the results of the battle just in the desert - the bandits did not have the habit of collecting corpses for their companions The people on the ground, the horse, and the body of the camel illustrate the fierce battle that had just happened. Wei stood there and looked at the thing that had just been thrown out by the other party - a small piece of sparkling stone, which should be a magic crystal. I didn't think there was a magician in the bandit team. This is really unexpected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle is over. Everyone started to treat the dead and wounded. Most of the bodies on the ground were bandits, but the soldiers were killed and injured, and several bodyguards were injured. Well, if it weren’t for the kind of bravery that Wei had just shown, if the battle continues, it’s not just that much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The magic book is not..." Kim wants to ask, but says If you don't speak, an answer is in your heart. There is no such thing as a coincidence in the world. The reason for this adventure is to pursue the goal! ! ? ? Nobis did not pay attention to Kim's current expression changes. During this time he was temporarily immersed in his own memories. Both of them were silent for a long time. In the end, Kim broke this silence. He gave up the previous thoughts. There is no such thing as a coincidence in the world. This kind of delusion is still not to be done well - the magicians are more realistic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nubis, I want to ask, do you know the demon?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The demon? When I was young, there were still a lot of demons, but now, there should be no demon on this continent! After all, they are infertile races - just like us! Right, I think, there should be still on the dark continent. Some demons... what do you want to ask the demon?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I saw a demon...he is very powerful..." Kim said to him The experience above the Dragon Island, "...I want to know, are the demons so powerful...they, are there any weaknesses...the fatal weakness?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The demon who can confront the dragons positively?" Nubis also fell into deep thought. "I know that the sage, he really is a demon... but I have never heard of the monsters are really powerful. power ...... "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;" you know him? "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;" for Although I have nothing to do with other Necromancers, I also know his existence... He seems to suddenly appear on this island, giving the lost Holy Grail to the Necromancer...so the other Necromancers compare to him. Grateful... When I came last time, I remember that he borrowed a lot of Dark Knights from us. I don’t know what it is... It’s interesting. He is actually planning an alliance against humanity? Hehe... Kim, you know, As long as the Dark Grail is in the hands of the Necromancer and is developed with real power, there is no need for any other help. The single necromancer can erase humanity from this world!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"However, you can rest assured that as long as I exist, I will not let this happen... Yes, that sage is not - just possible, because the demon is powerful, but still impossible and dependent on his own strength Dragons that cross the time and space - one of the devils?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The devil, but the devil is not..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is only a speculation. According to the book, the high-level goblins once created three demon swords to deal with the demon king. However, after the end of the battle, they left a... ... Does this mean that one of the devils has not been killed? Of course, this is only a guess. Since the warriors are coming back, the devil must be completely destroyed... but even if there is another one, it doesn’t matter, there is still a Demon sword is here...and, it is in the hands of your companions!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nubis, I want to ask... you know the demon sword The secret... although this is a very strong weapon, but it is not What's special... I mean, special power!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The secret of destroying the sword... I know some, this sword used to It fell to my teacher, he studied for a few months, but I don't know if you want to know..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tell me, Nubis I want to know!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This sword is amazing!" Sis turned over and looked at the demon sword in his hand. "There was a collision with the steel axe without any damage, and there was no gap. Oh, it was amazing! However, this kind of craft is rare, so dense. Pattern, oh, this seems to be a kind of text, as if I have seen it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Have you seen it?" Wei suddenly turned around With his eyes wide open, it looks like he wants to eat the other person. Maybe it is too urgent to know the mystery of this sword. He almost forgot the courtesy that should be there. Wei grabbed the shoulder of North. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah..." Feel that Wei exerted excessive power because of excitement, and North gave a scream, which power can harden the corner of a cow. Kneeling down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry!" Wei knew that he was rude. He quickly let go of his opponent. "I am so excited, please forgive me... Can you tell me where to see?" This text!" No wonder he is so excited, got the Demon Sword for so long, this is the first time I heard about this sword! Fortunately, this officer did not refuse when he wanted to borrow this sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This... I remembered it, in the city, there was a weird guy who claimed to be a linguist! I went to the city when I was stationed in the city. The house carries out routine inspections, and there is such a pattern on the wall of his house - at least he said it is a kind of text! But I would rather believe that this is just a pattern!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Which city?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is the city of La Punk that we are going to now, it was seen two days ago, so I Remember..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Great!" Wei’s face showed a smile that had not appeared for a long time. This is from knowing that he has a demon. After the cursing reality of this cruel reality, he laughed for the first time - it seems that this time can uncover the mystery of the demon sword. As long as you can know the secret of this sword, defeating the Eight-Eyed Devil may not be a dream. Although this hope is not certain, it gives Wei a little hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Isn't that a sword? But that is really a sword!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s just a shape! Although it has the shape of a sword, I believe it is not a sword! This is the final result of my teacher’s research! It is similar in appearance to other swords, and it is also open, but it should not be a sword, it should be a magic item - perhaps not a magic item, but it should be such a thing, It is something that is created to call for some kind of power. It is engraved with something that cannot be understood, as if it is a magical array, a strangely magical array that has never been seen before. However, the magic array is human. The magical development of the things, the magical array of high-level goblins are all from human magic, they should not have the ability to develop a new magic array, otherwise, we will definitely see it in the war of liberation. My teacher can not be analyzed after careful analysis. Understand, the last thing is gone. However, he once did an experiment. He wanted to use magic to read the will that the Demon Sword once held, in order to figure out the true face of the Demon Sword. At the time of the experiment, I was by his side... The experiment is terrible..." Nubis digs up the scene from the depths of his memory, and there is a shudder in his tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Before you come in, you have to knock on the door!" When the door of the house was pushed away by Wei Qiang, the person inside turned his head and said this sentence. Then, immediately turned around and looked at the thick book that I was studying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you are a robber or a thief, I advise you to go back immediately. I don't have anything worth robbing or stealing! Except my book - but you I shouldn't be interested in this kind of thing. Go to my next door, the guy is a jeweler, very rich! Don't waste time on me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "We are robbers?" Lev suddenly felt a burst of laughter. His fingers felt a little pain because they had knocked on the door for too long. If it wasn’t for a long time, there’s no need to deal with it. Not a solid door. The person inside the house is small and thin, and can't see the exact age, but it is probably inferred that he is about 60 years old. His clothes are praised as a compliment. In fact, this guy seems to have not been in a hundred days. Going out the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei Yue passed Lev and stepped forward, and he pulled out the Demon Sword from his waist and placed it in front of this linguist called Parker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing?" The old man was shocked. His gaze was set on the shiny sword of the Demon Sword. The killings were still very strong not long ago - then he looked up at the young man who was sinister (??). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I swear, I don't have money, nothing at all...you won't get anything in me...I only have books, and only I can Read the book... Don't kill me, kill me, you won't have any benefit..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't misunderstand, we are not robbers!" Lev Stepping forward, pushing Wei away, this warrior is strong, but it is not the kind of thing that is suitable for dealing with others. Although his intention is very clear, the other party may not be able to comprehend it - if someone suddenly breaks into the door And then put a sword in front of you, I am afraid that everyone will make the same answer as this old man - Lev chose the mildest tone, "We are just a bunch of passers-by, a bunch of things to cross the road People, in fact, we want to ask some questions about words. I heard that you are in this respect... authority, right, authority!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The problem with the text..." The old man still looks puzzled and looks at the four coming in. Then he saw a therapist wearing a robe Ai Erna, see a therapist he was really relieved, the robber is impossible to have a therapist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to ask?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to ask about this sword The question of the text!" Wei wants to talk, but Lev took the first step. When he opened the door, he saw the pattern on the wall. It was similar to the pattern on the sword. If it is a kind of text, it should be The same kind of text. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The sacred text of the higher goblins, is this sword a work of higher fairies?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, can you tell me what I wrote?" Wei tried his best to suppress the ecstasy of his heart and asked in the most polite way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leif looked at the old man’s big drink and he couldn’t bear it. Lived to compare this old man with the mysterious old Locke, the form of Parker’s meal gave him the feeling of meeting with the old Locke for the first time (of course, the first impression of the old Locke has been completely reversed). I don't know how long this old man has been immersed in the ocean of knowledge, but it seems that he has not eaten for at least ten days. Just now, the old man asked them to invite him to dinner as a reward for explaining these words, and he also picked the most large-scale restaurant in the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s full, I haven’t eaten so much for a long time, and it’s all good things!” Parker touched his mouth and said with satisfaction, he had already eaten The food for five people, the appetite is not the same as his appearance. Just before Leif’s opening, he made the next request, “There is one more thing, can you help me pay the debts, I owe this hotel a lot of money!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "How much?" Although Elna is around, Lev's tone is still reluctant - this is an estimated expenditure, and God knows how much the old man has eaten without giving money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are two kinds of words on the top, one is the sacred text of the higher goblin, the other is... This is the Monseco text. How is this possible? This kind of text is actually engraved on a sword with the sacred words of the higher goblins... ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What did you write above?" Wei Shi can't wait any longer. He doesn't have any interest in the type of text. He wants to know only the above. What? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The sacred text is a special text used by the higher goblins to worship the gods. It is different from the general text and is generally not engraved on any sword... Monseco text It is an ancient text that was eliminated in ancient times. It is said to be the character of the demon... How can these two things be together? On the side of the sword?” Parker ignored the words of Wei and continued to talk to himself. Maybe he didn't hear it at all, he has fallen into academic problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What did you write above?" Wei asked again, this time Parker reacted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This side says 'fangs', this should be the name of this sword! This is the name of the hateful front. This is probably an alias. Written in two different languages!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about these tiny?" Wei pointed to the small pattern underneath the main pattern (text?) I thought this was the nick left by the time of creation, but since those were originally thought to be patterns, they are also texts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I see... it’s complicated, although I’ve been researching it, but the information about Monsek’s text is too small, I can only translate a part of... ... gather all the hatred, curse again here, summon the power of destruction... to open the darkness... 'This point does not understand, the last word means 'door'!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Gather all hatred, curse again here, summon the power of destruction, open the door in the darkness!" Wei gently repeated the words of Parker, so remember firmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The word next to the blade is not a text, this is at most a certain symbol, I can't read it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is a terrible hatred, the hatred of the former holder of the sword, naked, leaving all other feelings There is only the remaining hatred... that hatred is terrible, and even can not tolerate the existence of other feelings... completely regardless of the cost, regardless of the consequences of hate... even my teacher at that moment, almost by this already passed away The hatred has been swallowed up... If it wasn’t for me to share some of the burden with him for magic, maybe he would be engulfed by this feeling... but it’s just this part that made me struggle for half a month to recover... ... really a terrible thing, can't imagine what role the warrior who once held him and the craftsman who built him are... the terrible hatred of gray sly..." Nubis seems to be struggling, Let yourself escape the terrible nightmare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hate? Is there anything else?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, even if there is, I can't tell the whirlpool of hatred... It was dangerous at the time!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kim stood on the ground and looked at the phantom Wei who came in front of him. Although he had not been known by the sword in the phantom, how many times he had run through it, but now he is not afraid at all, he is convinced that his victory is like The victory has been held in your own hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only the flexibility to use the power of magic is qualified to be called a magician, otherwise, no matter how much power, it is just a waste, this sentence is slave Bis said to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The phantom rushed over, rushed under the protection of vindictiveness, the sword was in hand, let the magician completely lose the chance of attack, but this time the magician Not going to attack. The magic was launched, and the elves of the wind pulled the body of gold to the sky, and the first wave of this Juggernaut attack fell through. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come on!" Kim clearly saw a huge set of wings behind the phantom, and then flapped his wings and flew up to heaven. I chased myself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The vindictiveness can resist, but it only attacks the magic directly!" The magician said softly, and then released the next magic. The mist was summoned by the magician from nothingness, quickly condensed, surrounded by two figures, very thick fog, almost can be said that the role of the human eye was offset. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dense fog, the squeaking sound of lightning continued. After this situation continued for a while, with a scream, a heavy body fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do it well, gold!" The voice of Nubis appeared in the mind of Kim at the right time. Apparently he was very satisfied with the magician's victory. "But, come again, this is my final test today, your opponent will have unlimited vindictive!!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Unlimited vindictive?" Magic Listening to this is almost the most unreasonable request. If the vindictiveness can be used indefinitely, the magician may have been extinct in the battle with the warrior, but the magician has not responded, and Nubis has spoken. "Close your eyes, get ready to start!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold closes his eyes and sees himself standing on the ground when he opens, the far away The Mirage is coming here. "The principle of vindictiveness is to use life energy to repel all elves! That is to say, if it is infinite vindictiveness, no magic can hurt the other party, even if it can trap the other side, it is useless..." The magician turned his brain, thinking Find a way to deal with "infinite vindictiveness." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The phantom rushed over again, the action was the same as before, the magician also knew that there was no chance of victory in fighting this guy on the ground, he used to fly like The magic flew into the sky, and the phantom flew over with the wings as before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ordinary magic is no way to deal with this guy, even if you can use the thick fog, quicksand, swamp and other magic to suppress the other side, there is no way to completely defeat him. You must think of a way to deal with vindictive defense..." Jin Quanli's flight, the phantom behind him is also fully chasing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei sat on the ground, and tonight he volunteered to keep the vigil, one day ago They were separated from the caravans, and after they set foot on their own, Wei was always confused by the interpretation of the linguist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Gather all hatred, curse again here, summon the power of destruction, open the door in the darkness!" Wei read it again, he vaguely felt this sentence Words are the key to the use of this sword, but it is impossible to figure out the last veil, as if it is known, but the last point of the total difference is incomprehensible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei repeatedly recited this strange word while playing the magic sword in the hand, but it is obvious that it is not a moment to uncover this riddle. Can be solved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a slight footstep behind him, but Wei didn’t have to look back to know who it was! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wei!" Lev did not hesitate to sit next to the soldier. "What are you thinking?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, I am just thinking about that sentence..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you hiding in everyone!" Lev was very calm. He said that he did not read Wei, but when he spoke out, the things in his middle made the soldiers feel shocked. "Leaving the Undead Island... No, I felt it before I arrived at Undead Island... In fact, more than that. I, everyone feels... What happened?" Lev turned his head to look at the soldier's face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No...nothing..." Wei turned his head and tried to avoid Lev's sight. But the thief moved the position and turned to him, and looked at him positively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened, made you look like this! Although you were not a talking person before, you can still have faces on your face. Finding - although wearing a mask at the earliest time - but coming back from Undead Island... No, it was earlier, I found that you are a little different from before! What happened?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No..." When he said it, Wei himself felt stupid. This level of lie is likely to be seen even by three-year-olds, let alone experience in this area. Rich thieves! Wei Benlai is not the kind of person who is good at communicating with others. In fact, before he came to the mainland, he had not had any deep communication with other people before he met with these partners. He himself knows that the fact of lying is not good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you agree that I am your companion? I don't know if you know that among the adventurers, there is one of the most important principles, that is, believe Companion, when you think your companion is untrustworthy, the relationship of the companion is actually over, and there is no point in being together again..." Lev spoke in a self-talking manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Is it true that these secrets are completely personal issues, telling others will only increase the trouble?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“No...”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened?" Lev glared at Wei. "Maybe I can't really help, but when I say it, there will be no result in my heart!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was cursed!" Wei said softly, very light, almost inaudible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? Cursed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, lend your knife to me. "!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leif pulled out a knife and threw it to Wei, Wei took off his gloves, and used a knife to draw a shallow wound on his finger, blood Flowing along the blade, but the wound immediately stopped bleeding at an incredible speed - only about ten seconds. When Wei took the hardened blood, the wound had disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is it?" Lev’s face was discolored, and he also heard about the curse. A person’s life in a few years is within a year or two. It is completely consumed, and after the short golden age, it is the moment of extinction, and there is only one way to eliminate the curse, that is, to kill the curse. But who knows that the curse will hide in the corner of the earth. Wei looked up and from his eyes, Lev saw the answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it the Eight-Eyed Devil? The Demon who claimed to be the Supreme? When?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When on the island of the dragon..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...It’s been a month and a half, according to the usual 18 months, and there are still Sixteen and a half months! We must find the way to use this sword in the remaining sixteen and a half months, and we must find the demon!" When I finished, Lev suddenly felt a frustration, no wonder Wei It will become like this, even if you can find the person who uncovers the mystery of this strange riddle, the devil is also a problem that can be met, as long as he hides for 18 months, even if Wei is trying hard, he will only die in vain. Share. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be like this, hopefully, first of all, we must find a knowledgeable and willing person to help uncover this strange riddle and then start looking Eight-eyed Devil... Yes!” Lev’s cry made Wei raise his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have a candidate who can uncover this riddle! Old Locke! He must know something!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I also know a way to solve the curse!" Lev suddenly turned his head and looked at the two men standing behind them. It is Elna who speaks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's go to the old Locke first, then go find the demon! If you can't find it, we can go to the temple of the goddess of life, my home. "Illna paused. "There is a way to unlock any curse there!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes! Say it, think about it together. Way! There must be a solution! "Bei Han took a hard shot of Wei's shoulder, the strength is great, but this time Wei feels more comfortable than massage. "After all, we are companions, companions who are adventurous! Your business is the thing of all of us!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The phantom of Wei tightly chasing, the flapping of the huge wings is always kept in the ears, reminding the golden enemy behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no way to attack..." The magician knows that he can't fight this phantom before he can find a way to deal with infinite vindictiveness, but it seems that there is no magic. Fight against vindictiveness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The phantom suddenly accelerated and rushed over to the magician, but Kim’s emergency crash escaped the attack of the sword at the last minute. A feather floated down and fell in front of the gold, which was the feather on Wei's wings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right!" A way to defeat the enemy appears in Kim's mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician turned and he did not intend to escape. He only had one chance. If he failed, he would have to enjoy the warmth of the sword! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind elves in the atmosphere violently under the control of the magician, and the vortex began to appear in the air, and then became a huge tornado. The magician invested all the power and made the tornado as big and strong as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The phantom is inhaled into this tornado without fear, the violent elf is useless in the face of vindictiveness, the strong wind immediately turns into nothing when it comes into contact with vindictiveness, and the phantom does not The magic will continue to approach the gold. As long as there is unlimited vindictiveness, magic can't hurt him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"See the trick!" Kim used his last power to move the tornado a little, wrapping the phantom in the center of the tornado - almost in the middle of a vacuum. Although the tornado did not cause any damage, but there was not enough air around the wings to flap the wings, the phantom patted the wings a few times, then lost the balance, the whole person fell, and fell from the vacuum trap under the magician. Go on. Although the phantom sent a strong vindictiveness to land with a reaction force when approaching the ground, he was flying too high...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magicist wipe After a sweat, then I returned to the truth in four weeks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Doing it well, doing it too well, even I didn't think I could use this method to deal with grudges! Haha, that's great!" Laughter, "I don't think it's the selected person! You have already passed the first part, and now you can start some special training!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This way... Is there any other way to deal with 'unlimited vindictiveness'?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, vindictiveness is not invincible, and all he can resist is only the elemental elf!" Smile, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I thought you would use that standard method."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Standard approach?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, use 'space restraint' first, then use 'space cutting' at the moment when vindictive resistance is magic, The influence of space magic on each other becomes a deadly weapon - if you can, you will see how the Juggernaut has become a piece of broken meat! However, Doing better, most flexible use of the power of magic, this is what a magician has to do!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I... I have not used The power of space magic!" Kim spent a long time, finally said his real situation, which can be said to be the magician's biggest weakness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah??!!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From a long time ago, I thought of it from my teacher I have been able to start learning space magic, I have been unable to use this most powerful and complex magic. I don't know why, even the most basic 'instant movement' can't be done, let alone other! I don't know why, I can't do it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can't do it? Impossible! At your level, even with powerful space magic Can't load, can't even make the most basic 'instant movement'?" The necromancer looked at Kim and had a thoughtful look on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it wrong? You, do you particularly like some kind of magic or hate some kind of magic? I mean elemental magic?" Maybe because of illusion The resulting spiritual connection still exists. Before the magician answered, Nubis gave himself the answer. "The most popular fire magic, because most of the fire magic is attack magic, the most annoying is the magic of the earth. Because the magic of the earth is dominated by auxiliary magic! Gold, this is why you can't use space magic!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have accepted the rule of the flame without knowing it, and the rule of the earth is rejected, maybe you are not aware of it, but this is the only explanation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"??"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Space magic, in a sense, is similar to grudge, it requires row Open all the sprites, all the sprites that cover the space, in order to operate on the space. Because of your power Although this kind of thing rarely occurs in ordinary humans, you can't completely arrange all the elves to meet the requirements of space operation!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Solve?” The magician asked, this question, his teacher, Xiu Ke, who is a big magician, can’t find out the reason, but this necromancer can see through it immediately. It’s really a magician of the Holy Light Dynasty era. Disciple of light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“How long?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Not necessarily, maybe one year, maybe ten years!” The words of the Necromancer gave Jin a bucket of cold water. . <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "really no other way to do it?" <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; slave Bies paused, as if Thinking about something, then he replied "Yes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the frustrated look of gold, Nubis smiled. "Don't force, can't use space magic." It will also bring you unexpected benefits! No matter who has the shortcomings, the key is not to turn your own shortcomings into their own shortcomings! Well, go back to rest first, and from tomorrow, I will give you some bans. The training of the curse!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The curse?" Kim suddenly felt the spirit, the power of the curse was that he could not forget, but this is a kind of destruction. Strength, although he once gained the right to control the curse through the contract with the god of nothingness, but he can't forget the price of the last incomplete control of the curse. Just that way, he almost killed his life, if true. To completely control the curse, then he is absolutely unable to survive. But the tone of Nubis in front of it suggests that the curse can be controlled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nubis, are you also a cursed mage?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, I It’s just an illusionist!” Nubis, who was about to leave, turned to look at Kim. "In this world, only two cursed mage have existed, and you are the third!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..." Although it may not be a lot to know the curse of the curse, it is not as exaggerated as what Nubis said! There were only two, and I was the third. Kim carefully considered the special situation of the spiritual exchange with the god of nothingness, but no matter how to search in memory, he could not remember the difficulty of setting this contract. - There is no special difference between the contract with other gods. "Why? Right, how do you know that I am a cursed mage?" Kim suddenly found one of the strangest things. He did not tell anyone about becoming a cursing mage, except for the strange old Locke and his companions. No one should know, then Nubis...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh..." Nubis laughed. "I still know a lot of other things. Don't ask, let's take a break today... Yes, I think of a way, how much can you solve the problem that you can't use space magic!" He said, he went to the magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take your robes off!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold took off his magician gown, Although the magician who has been working for so long, dealing with book magic all day, the muscles of his body are still full and strong. The eyes of the Necromancer are staring at the position of the golden heart, which already has a shallow tattoo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is your teacher giving you? It seems that you have a good teacher, even before, there are not many people who know this thing..."< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician looked down at the tattoo on his body. This is the magical array that the teacher put on him. It is repaired to make up for himself. His things, put this magic array in the heart of the body's most concentrated magic, can use a limited number of moments of movement per day (because it is very magical, so the magician does not generally use it), and the distance of movement is quite limited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...but this thing is not complete enough, you can improve it a little more..." Nubis said thoughtfully, then put a hand Go to the top of this tattoo magic array. When he took his hand off, Kim noticed a change in the magic array, and the tattoo increased a small amount. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as you complete the prayer and concentrate your will on this magical array, you can use the momentary movement, but you can only use the momentary movement. The magic consumed is usually More than ten times, so don't use it unless necessary!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You Is the person of the Sayādaw?" Victor has cut the subject directly after all the other instigators have been opened. Brett hesitated, but he immediately knew that there was no possibility of lying about the problem. The man in front of him looked at himself with a piercing gaze. Let's not say anything else, it's the best proof that the sorcerer brought him in. But then, Brett is still a bit strange. I don't know if it is because of some strange magic. No one can see the difference between the magician and the normal person. I can see it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor paused and seemed to be thinking about something. There have been so many things in recent times that the white hair of his horns has climbed up a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you want to do with you?" The emperor finally spoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He asked me to bring this box to my knees, and, I want to do things around my knees!" There is no concealment, no need to hide, cloth He was very happy to tell the origins, and he said that he took out the small box, which looked inconspicuous from the outer casing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor stared at the box for a while, although the appearance looked worthless, but the things sent by the Sayādaw must be useful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Open it!" Victor said to Brett in a commanding tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breiter puts the handle on the switch of the box and intends to start. The Sayādaw said to him, "You can't open the box by yourself." But now that two people are together, there should be no problem. Although it was necessary to resist the temptation to open this strange box many times along the way, but when it was really open, Brett felt a little trembling. Although he is doing things under the hands of His Holiness, Breit must admit that he has never really understood this mysterious creature. At least he has no knowledge of the true purpose of this master so far. Who knows what is inside this box? What? Victor stared at the messenger's messenger every move, and Brett's hand twisted the very ordinary switch with a little trembling. The switch opened without any unexpected difficulties, and the lid of the box bounced. A soft, multicolored light shines through the box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the box is a large, amazing multicolored jewel, the soft light is the jewel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah..." has been an emperor for so many years, but such a treasure is really unprecedented, no, it is unheard of, and the glory seems to be magical. The attraction of Brett and Victor is firmly attracted and cannot be undone. The brilliance changes constantly, weaving a dreamlike feeling, tempting every creature we see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is..." Breit’s voice was hoarse, although it was very clear that this was a gift from the Sayād to the emperor, and Any one can't compete with oneself, but at the moment, there is a strong yu hope in the heart. A yu hope that zhan has this treasure, even if it is to assassinate the emperor, the betrayal of the sage is willing to take the risk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright suddenly realized that this is why the Sayādaw ordered that he could not open the box by himself. The temptation of this gem is unbearable to anyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vicker stepped forward and took the box from the tight hand that Brett pinched, and immediately turned and used his body. Blocked the brilliance of the gems. Like Brett, he is also tempted by the power of gemstones. He also wants to have this rare treasure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brilliance of the gems disappeared from sight, but this saved the Brett, the power of temptation weakened, and reason once again occupied the dominant position, if Vic I didn't make this move. If you let this box hold a little bit in the cloth, Bruce might make stupid things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can go out!" The emperor’s head did not turn, saying that although behind him, Butlet knew that the emperor’s entire mind was now being used by this gem. Occupy, will not give him a substantial answer, so he bowed and bowed according to the etiquette, and then retired. However, at this moment, Breit knows his future, and others don’t say it. With this gift alone, the Victor Emperor has no reason to be slow to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go back to sleep first! I will be the vigil for you! I know that you are very Tired, although you are very strong, but after all, it is an individual, not a fight!" Lev patted Wei, and the latter stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the innumerable battles, the near-beast-like instinct makes Wei feel the threat of hiding in the darkness, and the sudden burst of vigilance on his face. The look made all the companions know that they were right. This should be said to be fortunate. In this time, except for the night watch, everyone is screaming and sleeping, but the adventurers are all equipped with all kinds of equipment, except that Behan’s sword of the earth is not carried on the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the cockroaches kept coming, at least ten bows were shooting, but the adventurers had already smashed down, relying on a raised small mound to avoid flying arrows. If the attackers changed from direct shooting to falling arrows, they would certainly kill a few, but fortunately they did not think of this. The attackers quickly realized that the attack of the bow and arrow had become useless, the sound of the flying arrows disappeared, and a row of torches lit up in the darkness. A tall body appeared in the light and shadow of the torch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come out, kid!" Very rough voice, where I heard it, Wei Dingjing looked and recognized that the other party was fighting him a few days ago. The robbers leader, "I have been here for so long, I have never lost, I did not expect to be defeated to you! Today is my intention to come to you for revenge, come on, let us singled out, and then try!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't go out, Wei!" Lev took out his short bow - fortunately, this thing was carried on the body. "He wants to lie to you, I bet that at least twenty bows are waiting for you! I also say that I am single-handed, and if I don’t say anything, let the bow and arrow start first, it is a sneak attack!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The husband took an arrow and put it on the bow. Although the short bow had a lower range, it was not vegetarian. The person was killed. Because of the squatting on the ground, Lev took some time to aim at the neck of the bandit who boldly exposed himself to the fire, and opened the bowstring. Although there is no exaggeration for wearing a hundred steps, but Lev is 100% sure of this distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bowstring rang, and as expected, the arrow hit the corner of Racker accurately, but was disturbed by the force just before the shot. Suddenly, the principle of deviation from the target, slipped to one side, but a scream that came with it proved that the arrow did not fail at all, even if it did not hit the target. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a magician! There are magicians among those guys!” Wei suddenly remembered the reason for letting Rakael escape in the fierce battle, if not If you don't know where the magician is hiding, Rakaer will spend a few months recovering from injury even if he can escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait a minute, if they have a magician, why not attack with magic?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I don't think we have to wait too long, it will come soon, if you don't go out!" Wei said, then he stood up, "Reassured!" He whispered to his companion who wanted to stop him, " With this armor protection, I am not so easy to be killed by them, and apart from you I will be free to use vindictiveness, and magic will not threaten me. Even if it is dangerous, it is so dark, it is very easy to escape! The magician should not be very strong. If it is strong, it will not be shot at the end. Rest assured! Right, if we are unfortunately separated, where should we meet?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone took a look at each other and finally answered by Behan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, you go slower, we take this opportunity to get around them, if they are lost, join in the city of Delante!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rakel stood in the fire, illuminating his torch is not in the hands of the person, but in the ground, his subordinates are hiding do not know which In the shadow, one can't see it, maybe as Leif said, now there are at least twenty bows aimed at the slowly approaching Wei. As Wei approached, he saw Raquel's hand empty, but at his feet, there were at least 30 weapons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bonfire that originally exposed the adventurer’s position was already smothered by the adventurer in the way of dodging arrows, now except Wei, others Protected by the dark. The night tonight is really thick. When the enemy concentrates on Wei, the actions of others should not be noticed...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A weapon!" Rake said to Wei. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My weapon can be used with this one!" Wei shook his sword in the hands of the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it? Let's get started!" Rakker picked up one of the weapons on the ground, a long but delicate sword. The length is more than one-third of the Demon Sword, but it is not as good as it is. If it is in contact with the broad sword like the Demon Sword, it will be cut into two pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rakel holds this stiletto, facing Wei, he is very powerful when he holds the tomahawk in his hand, but holds this thin It’s a bit ridiculous when it’s a weapon like a bar. This sword doesn’t really match his big man. However, since he chose this weapon, there must be his reasons, and Wei Si is not scornful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a slight tear, Lev divided his own piece of rock with the same color of the rock, the enemy had a magician, dark It is not an effective mask, but with this cloth, it should be able to do something unexpected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am from the left... Behan first goes to take the sword, then from the right... Elna goes from the right to the back... The number of enemies must be quite a lot Don't be soft...well, do it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laker Finally, I couldn’t stand it. He attacked first. He didn’t know why. The sword was almost the same as the Tomahawk in his hand. He didn’t have any skill at all. He went straight to Wei when he was rounded. Wei wanted to slash the sword, but he immediately noticed that the sword had left a blue mark after being stroked in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the last moment, the instinct played a role, Wei gave up the plan to parry, jumped back and forth, and the sword was able to pass over the chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you recognize it?" Although this did not come across, but Rakael’s face was smug, "It’s useless to recognize it. Your metal armor and weapons are the reason for your failure! You have a strong sword, but as long as you touch this sword, you will finish playing! Haha... no matter how much you have, you can’t escape today. Lost..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sword is dancing wildly in Rakael’s hand, woven into a blue battle net in the air, though I don't really know the reason for this weapon, but Wei's instinct tells him that he can't touch the sharp sword that looks very fragile. He forcibly restrains every time he wants to swing his sword, just keep on Move your body and dodge enemy attacks. While moving, he did not forget to analyze the enemy's footwork. Although Rachel had a seemingly chaotic attack on his face, he saw it from his footwork, and he was using these uncontrollable slashes to smash Wei. Forced in a certain direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"is the center of the torch bush! There are traps there!" Although in a state of defense, Wei is not completely unable to fight back, but each When he came out of the sword, the opponent's weapon's target would be transferred from his body to the demon sword, forcing him to take back the sword. If you fight from the front, whether it is strength, speed, skill, experience, Wei all have the upper hand, but the opponent’s hand does not know the origin of the weapon plus the distraction to deal with the sneak attack that may appear from the dark at any time. Kyle gained the dominance of this battle. Basically, Raquel can always keep the distance within a suitable range just beyond the attack distance of the Demon Sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the oppression of the enemy, Wei began to slowly move closer to the center of the torch. The blue light blocked the other way and forced him to the only direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leif’s body moves silently like a shadow under the cover of a cloth of the same color as the rock. It is his specialty to do this kind of thing. Before the departure, he put aside the things that might be in the way of bows and arrows. He only brought his short sword and knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of enemies is less than expected, the speed of the torches from the enemy, the scale of the bow and arrow shooting, probably can judge that they have at least 30 people. But so far, none of the thieves have encountered it, either that the enemy is gathering together or that it is very open. All the positions of the archery that were just expected were touched by him once, but none of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leif has shrunk his body to a smaller limit and has reached the maximum limit. Under the camouflage of the cloth, he is almost the same as ordinary stone. He bite a knife in his mouth, and the short sword is held on the elbow. He is very alert now. The enemy will suddenly be attacked and must be prepared. Otherwise, who will make a second time to such a powerful warrior as Wei. The challenge? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A stone rolled a little, the sound is so small that even a rabbit can’t hear it, but it can’t escape the senses of the tight thieves who are all nervous. There is a careless guy who has exposed his position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a pit, two people are hiding there, their eyes are attracted by this wonderful battle in the fire, and no one is found. The sly body appears behind. In the scheduled plan, they have no need to play, just look at the leader to win. There were not many people coming here. They mainly came to be witnesses and proved how Rakell won. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person in front looked at the battle carefully, and Rakael has no doubt taken the advantage, but it takes a little to turn this advantage into a victory. time. I have never seen such a flexible person, wearing a heavy body, can still subtly flash the same Thunder-like attack, the speed, the kind of flexibility and flexibility, so that he feels very fortunate, in that Fortunately, in the battle, I was not stupid enough to stop in front of this warrior. Otherwise, I would have fallen into the arms of Pluto. This is a man, it is simply a fighting machine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
