			<div id="content">"Calm! Calm!" Kim said to himself in his heart, and then his mind calmed down in an incredible way. The situation is not so bad now. In the illusion of Nobis, he also encountered a hundred times worse than now. It’s been over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation is now that Bright is preparing for new magic, but his magic is not enough to withstand this new attack. Kim knows that he can't go on the front again, but what should he do? If you escape, on the one hand, he can't escape this magic. On the other hand, he has been surrounded by enchantment. I don't know where it is the exit of this enchantment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician looked at the other person’s thoughts on the spell, and he suddenly thought of one thing—Bright had never used defensive magic since the beginning, now He is in a state of complete defense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold grabs a stone at the foot and throws it all out to Brett’s head. It’s too late to attack the spell, but the same is true for the stone, just let the cloth Wright was disturbed in the process of using magic, his concentration was broken, and the power he concentrated would have an impact on him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stone flies to Bright with the wind, but Kim has never done any training in throwing stones, but at the moment the distance between two people is twenty meters The stone that had entrusted the hope of gold failed his mission, passing by far from the head of Brett, but did not cause any interference to Bright. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are finished, Kim." Brett showed a sneer, then an energy rushed over to gold, a energy that could turn him into a stone, this is petrified magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oops!" This is Kim's last thought. He instinctively stretches his hand in front of his face, although this is actually useless. A shocking sense of sensation came over, and Kim felt a shudder in his body. This is a powerful force that can turn the human body into a mineral. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I...has not been petrified..." Kim finally recovered, and since there is still thought, he is still alive. He put down his hand covering his eyes and saw the warrior in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We arrived at the last minute, and he timely offset the petrochemical magic of Brett with concentrated vindictiveness. At this moment, he was blocking the front of the gold, holding the sword of demon in his hands, facing Bright. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cut! Another one!" Brett grinned disdainfully, and did not put Wei in front of the gold in his eyes, even though he was there. He was seen at the contest, knowing that he is a Juggernaut and able to fight against all magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did Wei come in? Kim suddenly thinks about this problem in his mind. Has Brightt used enchantment to isolate the outside world? But he immediately got the answer, it was only because Brett’s enchantment was too big, and the mortuary where Wei was located was included, so that the warrior could notice the magic battle and save him in time. . But how can Blett have this power, can rely on his own magic to maintain this level of enchantment? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei stood there motionless and confronted Brett. He knew how to fight these magicians, especially like this one. Don't move first, when the magician screams quickly, and then use the grudge to counteract the first attacking magic, so that the opponent can't escape the second magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But But Bright just looked at him with a sneer and didn't use magic. It seems that in his eyes, this Juggernaut is not worth mentioning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold looked at all this, he didn’t understand why Bright was so confident. He just used Wei’s vindictiveness to block petrochemical magic. He should have seen it. Why didn’t he prepare for it? What method does he have to face vindictiveness? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter what the eagle method can't break the defensive defense! But Brett waited so sneer, and he didn't intend to use a flying magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Roll! Otherwise, die!" Brett spoke up. The battle with Kim just strengthened his confidence in his strength, although this confidence was previously easy. It has collapsed, but it has been regained in the battle with Kim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weiss did not pay attention to the threat of the other party, he just stared at each other's face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Looking for death! Good, come on, even if you send out your useless vindictiveness, see if I will cut you into pieces." laugh it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a moment, Kim knew why Bright was so confident, because he knew how to use magic to fight against vindictiveness - the orthodox method that Nubis had told him on the Undead Island - first bound with space, then cut with space, then sword The vindictiveness that St. used to protect himself became a grave to bury himself. The shattered space would cut the human body into pieces in the gap after the outbreak of fighting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright stopped laughing, his face began to look serious, everyone knows that he is ready to start spelling, and Wei is staring at his face, tight Hold a long sword and be ready to pounce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop!" A voice came, and then a figure was inserted between Wei and Brett. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't want to fight." Mingke opened his hands in the middle of the three people, she looked at Wei, the kind of begging eyes made the soldiers tight The string brakes came loose, he only kept a warning posture, and Kim just looked at the sudden appearance of the girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is...mink?" Jin whispered to Wei, who later said that the idea was not the illusion of gold. The magician suddenly understood that the thief's half-joking speculation was completely in line with reality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't call, brother!" Mink turned and said to Brett. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Brother... Brother?" Kim simply doesn't believe in his own ears. Mingke is actually...Bright's sister? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's open, Mink, this has nothing to do with you!" Brett replied with anger in shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't let it!" Mink responded with a firm look to Brett. "You two shouldn't fight!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Quickly let go, or I will kill you!" Brett threatened to send an electric light, not far from the foot of Mink, but this threat can not shake the girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You two are my most important people, you can't kill each other. If he knocks you down, then I will be very sad if you knock him down Then I will hate you forever!” Mink grabbed the pajamas’ chest tightly and said firmly to his brother’s brother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You..." Brett’s face began to turn red, then turned green, but in front of him was his sister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His father has five children, but only Mink and he are born to a mother. This sister grew up with him, no matter how worried. He can't start with Mink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He is the one you said?" Brett asked with a sullen look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mingke told him about the trip to the North, she didn’t need to hide this thing from her brother, but Bright didn’t dream of being a half-orc It was Kim and his companions who rescued her in her hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Mink replied that her expression and eyes could not be misunderstood. If Bright wanted to kill Kim and his companion, His magic must first pass through Mink's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold was confused at first, but he quickly inferred what had happened. Ming Ke is a woman, and is the sister of Bright. Wei just went here so desperately to see her, and Mink blocked the conflict between Wei and Breit. This kind of information is mixed and analyzed, and the answer is clear. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minck is actually Wei’s lover? At the thought of this thought, Kim could not help but feel a mess in his mind. To know that Mink is the wife of Max, the Crown Prince of Leite, they have just held a grand wedding during the day. God knows this relationship, what kind of consequences this kind of feeling will bring to them! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But across from him, Bright’s brain is more chaotic, and the heavy contradictions overlap in his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hates gold because he can't hate himself. He was defeated in the school, insulted in the ring, deprived of magic by Raymond, and scorned and ridiculed after returning home. He was forced to choose to be a sage in order to restore his strength. He was almost wolfed on Undead Island. Killed... It’s all because of gold, it’s because of this guy like a bull. Without him, it won’t happen. His life will be stable and stable. Once I thought about the insults that were lost because of the loss of magic, his self-esteem was like a glass being smashed by a hammer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the girl did not move, her eyes only revealed more determined determination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright began to recite the spell, a flame condensed in his hands, Kim nervously prepared to defend the magic, intends to protect Mink, but Mink still does not move, Both eyes continue to look at her brother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright finally gave in, he smashed the blast ball to the rockery on one side, let the innocent stone fragments fly all over the sky, and then slammed the foot Turn around and leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Minck...you...is it really a woman?" When Mingke came over, Kim still asked a little unbelievable. After careful observation, he found that Mink did have a three-pointer with Bright, but if he didn't see the scene, he wouldn't associate the two with his brother and sister. Moreover, if he didn't see it tonight, he wouldn't associate Mingke with the bride. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't say, you are going!" Mink said nervously to the two men. She knows Brighter's temper better than them. He may temporarily retreat, but it is absolutely impossible to stop. "Someone will come soon, you must go now!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright left a strange voice in the direction of departure, as if a group of people came over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are going!" Mink pushed the Wei, who was slightly hesitant, and the warrior knew that he could not stay any longer. He turned and followed the magician. . But he just took two steps, turned his face like he thought of something, and then he almost stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minke is crying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tears that were previously suppressed are not arrogant at the moment when Wei turns around and wants to go. Mingke doesn’t know why, just thinks that he Some of the things that were suppressed lost control at this moment, and all broke out. She looked up and saw Wei's eyes, which was no longer the indifferent vision of the previous armor protection. This vision was full of concern and seemed to ask her why she was crying. This is the truth of two people. When they have to break up, they can see each other's true intentions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry," Mink sobbed and said in a whimpering voice, "Big Brother...maybe we really have no points..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why do you say this?" Wei stepped forward and tried to grab the shoulders of Mingke's trembling with tears, but the sound of Kim was passed at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wei, go, don't go, it's really too late!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The far one The vocals are getting closer and closer, and if you hesitate to go down, you can’t escape. Wei turned around decisively and left with the magician. Then he found that there was only the picture of Mingke crying in his mind, and everything else was chaotic. He just mechanically followed the magician and ran behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness...you have nothing?" A group of guards finally appeared, and they immediately saw that the door was still unable to move because of the paralysis. Unlucky. They took the lead and carefully asked the Mink standing in the courtyard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing, let's go." Mink turned to face these people, she had already dried her tears, leaving only a slightly reddened eye . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said nothing, you will leave me immediately ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold ran ahead, and a series of magics from Bright had caused him no small damage, but even so, he ran very fast. On the way he just came, he remembered the road roughly, so when the two people went back, there was no way to come on the road, no need to cross the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people didn’t talk all the way, Jin’s heart was worried about the action of the night, and Wei thought about Mink’s face that was tears. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only hope of the magician is that Mink can suppress this matter by his own position, but he knows that he cannot hold too much hope for this matter. Mink didn't know their mission, and the guy who was lying on the ground with paralyzed magic - telling the truth is really lucky, maybe it's God, the two people's magical battles didn't even affect them - again Unable to hide evidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kim suddenly felt very regretful. Why did he follow Wei? He should have prevented Wei from doing this kind of thing. After all, it is much more important to prevent the half-orcs and the dwarves from forming alliances than his own. But he also knows that things are irreparable. Since they have already done so, regret is useless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A white light suddenly cut through the dark sky, followed by the second, third... soon, the night sky became bright, originally today The lighting magic that should be turned off at night is suddenly turned on, and the light is stronger than usual, and it is exactly the same as during the day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s over!" Kim immediately understood what was going to happen, and Mink couldn’t hide it. The guards were relieved of paralysis and said what they saw. Out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wei, go away!" Kim also can't take care of hiding his body. In fact, there is nothing to hide. Anyway, it will definitely come again. The search was discovered sooner or later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people walked through the garden in tandem, rushing back to the starting position to meet with their companions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gold!" A figure jumped out from behind a rockery and scared the gold jump. But he saw that after Lev, a heart calmed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's you, Lev, ah, how are you here..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but Less than half of Kim’s words were interrupted by Lev. “Where did you go, we don’t know what to do now...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened?" Kim immediately understood from Leo’s words that something must have happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There was a big bang over there, which led to a lot of guards and some magicians." Lev said while pointing to the distance - there It is the place where old Locke went. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Big Bang?" Kim asked with amazement, it seems that the reason for the magic lighting device to open is not because of their actions, but because of the explosion. Yes, I didn't hear it. Kim suddenly remembered this question, but he immediately got the answer. It was Bright's enchantment. Because of the enchantment, the sound of their magical battle could not be transmitted, but the outside voice also Can't pass in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Does the old Locke come out?" the magician asked. Lev just shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened?" Kim left Lev and turned to go to the explosion, but Lev caught him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't go, Kim, I have already seen it." Lev's expression actually added his words, "Nothing... There is nothing left... houses, walls, flowers and plants... nothing.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden a bit, he can hardly believe his ears, old How can Locke’s ability make such a thing? But Lev could not deceive him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the way, Kim suddenly thought of a question. How did this explosion come about? An explosion that destroyed a large area is unlikely to be created by a magic trap. Moreover, with the old Locke's ability, what magic trap should not be able to do anything about him. If it is not a trap, it is unlikely to be the result of a magical battle, unless the Sayādaw comes here and fights with Old Locke. If it is not, then there is only one answer - this explosion was made by Old Locke himself. If it is this mysterious old man, he is undoubtedly capable of doing this kind of thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold’s mood is loose, and even a little smile on his face, he thought he had already understood this thing, it seems that the old Locke has got the gems. And, in order to let humans die for this gem, it created this big bang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's go!" Kim said to Lev, who was shocked by his smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are gone, it’s no longer meaningful to stay here, we Let's go." Kim said to Lev a little excitedly, "What about Behan and Elna?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassure, old Locke has left, if he wants us, he will find us."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright looks at the distance, just now a guard has told him what happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Big Bang?" can be judged from the direction, that is the secret bedroom of the emperor's majesty, and the place to preserve that seductive jewel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before he played against Kim, he was driven out by the Sayādaw. Since the big bang occurred, the Supreme Master must have fought with the strange old man. But who is that old man? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A spiritual wave pierced into Bright’s mind, and before he could respond, the power of the invasion gained the information he wanted to know and then retreated, speed He was not aware of it, he could only vaguely feel that there was a closeness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sir?" Bright turned and found the huge figure of the black robe, and the gem was fascinating in his hand. But now this artifact is useless no matter how much it struggles, because one is not tempted by it at all, and the other is unable to act. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The man..." Brett hesitated to say that since the sage appeared here and held the jewel, the old man was finished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Escape." The sage looked at the gems and replied, "Oh, anyway, my purpose has been reached. In this case, there will be more in the future." Fun. Hehe... Anyway, the victory of the war is already in my hands."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purple robes of the zombie mage looked at the space in the hand to operate the ball, a crack appeared on the crystal sphere, in order to resist the almost irresistible interference, the ball has reached the limit of the load. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this magical product has completed its mission, with the distortion and transformation of space, the body of the old Locke has appeared in the center of his temporary painting magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nubis left the crystal ball and let it fall to the ground - this once precious treasure is now just worthless crystal fragments - he I came to the old Locke and took a deep bow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello, teacher."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Locke looks at the person in front of him, his face There is an unexplained smile, like self-deprecation, but also helpless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't be like this, Nubis, I am not your teacher anymore - I am now, nothing is..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No...you will always be my teacher. Since I started studying magic under your door, I was destined to be your disciple all my life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You... never hate me, Nubis? I changed you into a necromancer, letting you lose everything you have, you can only live alone "The world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is the inevitable sacrifice, teacher. And that is my own choice, you have never forced me...<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... Moreover, I have eternal time to study all kinds of knowledge, I have been comforted enough in magic and books."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have already said, Nubis," Old Locke took the magical array and said with an indescribable sad expression, "I am not your teacher, I am not Master - even not a human being. Oh, no, I can't use the word 'already' because I have never been a human being, I am just the name called magic. The human ambition of the Holy Light, in order to continue A ambiguity created by his ambition. I have no past, no future, I will neither live nor die, my existence is only to realize the ideal of the illusory 'protecting human beings', and this responsibility It has begun to exceed my ability. Just like the one just now," he lowered his voice. "I failed. At least the failure of the war in the north is inevitable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;When we were forced to use the power of chaos, you told me more than once to prevent the rebellion of that power, so you survived in this way - because the necromancer can be seen at a glance - for so many years In time, you have fully realized your wishes. Although we are facing a more difficult situation than before, isn't everything in your expectation? Maybe the details are different, but the overall situation is not as bad as you said. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, how do you know that I need help? After a moment of silence, the old Locke changed a topic. "How come it happened to bring me out?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Forgive me, teacher, I have a 'combined eye' on your body and saw everything you see in your eyes. But believe me, I have absolutely no intention of being rude to you, I just want to help you at a critical time..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Forget it...this It’s also a day, let me not be destroyed – right, what happened to Undead Island? Is there any new move for Wolf? "Old Locke sighed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wolf has been destroyed - destroyed by the sage, now the undead island has ushered in its new owner . "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The new owner? Wrong, it’s the new ruler! Is there a new zombie mage? "#br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, respect the teacher, not the zombie mage, now the ruler of the undead island is Wolf's daughter Babe. I don't know why, but she is a living person, but she inherits the power of Pluto. She can now completely control her death. In front of her, even I can't resist it. I can only obey. All the people who belong to the death category are affected by her. control. "Older Locke has been indulging for a long time, but he suddenly started to laugh, but the smile disappeared immediately: "It turned out to be like this..." Understand..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nubis! Old Locke suddenly said loudly, "Can you still use space to move?" Immediately pass me to the temple of Leica! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, teacher, after losing space to operate the ball, my strength is not enough to send you there - because there is no position within my ability. Point..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So prepare the boat and send me to the mainland! "Old Locke said this, then he turned and walked toward the nearest seaside. But the Necromancer did not move, he just stood there.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened? Bis? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher, I have a question." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? Let's talk. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The young man, that is called gold, do you have any special purpose for him?" In so many years, I have never seen you take care of someone, you gave him the ability to curse the Master, and let me try to cultivate his qualities - what are you doing for? Do you want to bring that ordinary human being into the battle behind this? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh," Old Locke laughed. "Are you jealous, Nubis?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Locke turned to face the Necromancer, and the expression on his face became serious: "Nubis, you listen, that young man is a new force of chaos." s Choice! Although I didn't have any purpose for him at first, he was only one of the many people on the street who passed by, and his friends were the same. I only took them to kill time, but I found that the power of chaos chose him. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Listen to me, don't interrupt me. I don't know what the reason is, and I don't know why I could get the power of chaos in the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because I don’t even know it myself. So I can't teach that to my students. You also know that the essence of chaos is disorder, that is, there is no reason. This is why a talented person like you can't be a cursed mage, and that a young man with no qualifications and no qualifications can be chaotic. The god made the contract. Believe me, I have never concealed anything from you - I have always given it to my students, and of course you are no exception - manipulating this is just a law behind it, a rule that you and I can't understand. That rule chose him, and not choosing you is as simple as that. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nubis bowed his head, and the old Locke's answer, even if it wasn't for him, was at least acceptable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher, what role do you want that young person to play?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know "Old Locke whispered, "I am not a god. The future is not entirely in my hands." He silenced, but immediately raised his voice. "There is no extra time, Nobis, I must As soon as possible, rush to the temple of the goddess of life!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright returned to his room, and the sage had already waited for him inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How?" The sage still asked with his voice as a frog inside the box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no exception." Brett replied, "No traces, no hidden people. The guards have searched the entire area, everything. Nothing found."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that I underestimated him...hehe!" said the Sayādaw, then he suddenly stepped forward and extended one The hands covered in cyan scales - strictly speaking, can be called claws - cover the head of Bright, "ah -"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No Move... rest assured, just to help you eliminate unnecessary things.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A strong mental volatility suddenly spread into Bright’s mind, that power Crossing his defense without any hindrance, easily rummaging through every hidden corner of his spirit, the feeling is simply unspeakable, but it is not a pain... The hand of the sage is shrunk back, he looks at it The jewel in a corner of the room, this jewel could not seduce his servant for a long time, because It has eliminated its influence in the spirit of Brett's and add a layer of defense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have a sister?" The Sayādaw suddenly opened his mouth and made Brett startled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes. What's wrong?" Brett asked, he didn't know that in the process just now, the Sayādaw had read his memory by the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing... Oh, wait and remember to return this jewel to Victor." He particularly aggravated the word "陛下" and let People sound like irony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Jin and his four companions escaped from the tunnel they came in At the time, a group of insulted dwarves were urging war remarks in their underground cities. Although the word has been circulated in almost every dwarf and their allies, the elders added a little oil to the fire and added a handful of salt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the most moderate and oldest dwarves - these people are generally respected in the dwarf society and are the main force against and human warfare - There is no way to stop the belligerent remarks of young people. In fact, the dwarves are not as uncomfortable as they are. They are a brave cultivating race, and this event opens the last door to war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go to the ground, give people a lesson, let them taste our power!" This sentence is now widely spread in the underground world, on the one hand Out of anger against what humans do, the other is from the nature of the dwarf's fanaticism. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their king, Brown Beard Luman V is considering the book of the Orcs sent by the demon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although from himself to his courtiers, all of them agree that the demon is not trustworthy, but so far he seems unable to find a rejection of this alliance request. The right reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The presence of the Supreme in the Dwarf City was a matter of decades ago, when he came here as the messenger of the Orcs. The difference is that it was a request for mutual trade, and this time it was a military alliance. Although they are extremely distrustful of the demon, the Sayādaw does not seem to deceive them. At least there is no trace of deception so far. Every trade is paid very accurately and has never been owed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have any opinions?" Brown Beard Luman V swayed the League book and asked his ministers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a lot of discussion in the group, and the image of Luman VI played a big role in this debate. There were almost no resolute oppositions, most of them agreed, but there were also a few cautious thoughts that it should be better to observe first. However, the number of steady numbers is too small, so this proposal was quickly passed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dwarf King used his great seal to force the Covenant's instrument, and the covenant was concluded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five people left the city that never sleeps at dawn. Although Kim regrets not carefully studying the ancient lighting magic, it seems that there will be no result when staying here, not to mention the big things that happened last night, or it is better to go early. Although Brett temporarily retired, but by his position, it is convenient to find some trouble for these five adventurers. In fact, Kim is not wrong, and the latter is planning to do so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened last night was not said by two people, and no one else asked. Everyone knows what happened to Wei and Kim’s sudden action. Kim’s body and face are full of bruises that are difficult to eliminate using healing, and Wei’s face becomes very awkward, often calling him Only half a day promised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five people are now on the road, they have no next action target. Just leave the city that never sleeps for the time being. Old Locke left Lev - afterwards, he knew that when he was called at night, he gave Lev a purse - quite a lot of money, enough for them to spend a long time. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where are we going now?" Lev asked casually, they are now going to the West. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "First go to Wei to drive away the curse on him." Behan proposed, then he turned to Wei and asked, "How are you saying?" It has been said explicitly that there are only two ways to get rid of the curse: one is to let the cursed person eliminate the curse, and the other is to go to the temple of the goddess of life to ask for the eviction ceremony, the latter must be presided over by the senior therapist, is a A very expensive ritual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...ah...well." When everyone focused on him, the warrior reacted, his face was very unsightly. It seems that in the days when he left the city that never sleeps, he did not sleep well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Alna, you are a therapist, you should be familiar with the situation of the temple. If you clear it, we can save a lot of trouble. ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Draining? But..." Elna replied softly, but her voice was too light, and she walked in front again, almost no one Notice what she wants to say and stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Haha, Wei, you are a little happy, you are so bad that everyone can’t raise it." Behan shot hard on Wei’s back. In the end, trying to make the atmosphere more active, it is not very comfortable to hurry in this dull atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry." Wei whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you do, you don't need to apologize." Lev added. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, haha..." When he spoke, Wei Cai understood that he was wrong. He smiled a little embarrassed, although the smile looked Still relatively stubborn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hahahaha..." Several people laughed together, although this was not a very funny thing in itself, but the dull travel of these days was finally broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of horseshoes came from far away. Although the sound is still very light, it can be heard quite densely. It should be the voice of a team. But this didn't attract the attention of the adventurers, because although they are close to the land of the Red Alliance, but this is still the territory of Reiter, they do not need to beware of the wanted order from Delant - in the Red League, any The country’s wanted orders are valid, and bounty hunters are looking for suitable prey everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold’s heart is thinking about Bright. He still remembers the contest in the city of Delante. The magic of Brett and him can be said to be indistinguishable, but it was only after a year, he actually had such terrible power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magic is a long road, there is no shortcut. This is the same truth that all the magical elders Kim has ever seen to him. However, what I saw in the city that never sleeps is enough to overthrow this view - no matter what you think, the extraordinary power of Brett can never be cultivated by the individual in this year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kim remembered the magic book, which was supposed to belong to his magic book. Maybe the book contained a method that could quickly increase the magic in a short time. Unfortunately, the book was taken away by the sage, and from It’s almost impossible to take it back in the hands of the Sayādaw – this possibility has not been thought of by Jin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leif’s voice interrupted Kim’s ideas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where are we now, Behan?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I look at the map... Well, it should be at the junction of the original Delante and the Red Alliance. Because of the war, almost all the villages have been forced to relocate, but we have already brought enough supplies, no problem. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red Alliance! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This word suddenly hits the magician's consciousness and reminds him of what happened in the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Going to Berek City in two days, then we... Kim, what's wrong, how do you stand still?"<br <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician is looking up at the front. On a small highland on the side of the road, a broken bird net is hanging on the tree that has been baptized with flames. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may be the proof that the relocated residents have lived in this area, but there is nothing worth to look at so carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lev looked at Kim a little puzzled. He didn’t know that Kim had ever experienced the experience of being netted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here is..." Kim muttered, he already remembered, here is the time he just left the Stone Tower, but the last time There is also a very vibrant little village nearby, but now there is only a piece of sporadic green that has been newly born after the flame has burned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold quickly took a few steps and got ahead of the hill. The mountains are now low trees that have just been born for less than two years, so the horizon is very broad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold can see the village in the distance, and the flat outside the village as the battlefield of the two armies, even if there are no traces left now But the first battle of his night was still in the mind of the magician. At the limit of sight, he was trying to climb the hill that night, but he did not succeed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gold, what's the matter with you?" Lev came behind Kim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing." The magician turned a little lost. Maybe time can really heal the pain. At the beginning, he once cursed why he could not protect the old village chief and hated his incompetence. But after coming here two years later, he found the kind of annoyance in his heart. Grief has now been reduced a lot, although I can't say that I have no feeling at all, but I can't feel the feeling of the original. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I heard that there is no," Lev said behind him. "The Red League does not seem to give up resistance. Although they have surrendered on the surface.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They often send light cavalry harassment, there is often fighting in the vicinity, the situation is very tense, and the passing people are subject to strict checks."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes?" Kim answered inadvertently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hooves behind him began to scream loudly, the horse-riding team approached, and five people began to walk by the road, lest they wait for the way to block others. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You see here." Behan pointed to the thick bushes on the side of the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This zone may not be affected by the war, so the bushes are particularly dense, the green dense vines and the thorny shrubs plus the years of trees make up a green Fortress. "There is enough to hide a thousand people plus a thousand horses here. It is really a good terrain for guerrillas."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no one inside." Wei replied that although the eyes could not penetrate the green barrier, his instincts knew that there was no danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When a mercenary?" Wei whispered aloud this half-joking proposal, but what he thought and Behan thought was totally different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe when the trip is over, the partners will be a mercenary when they are scattered. But what about the Sayādaw? Old Locke and the words he said did not give him a fatal blow, but he has also spread the desperate mood in the depths of his heart. Even the ancient people who cast this fire magic sword can't exert its power, let alone him - a man who won't be magical by chance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sudden hoofs coming from behind began to slow down, and then a voice came: "Hey, a few of you, stop!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five people turned back almost at the same time, saw a team of armed soldiers, the one who led the one was looking at them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One, two...five, the number is just right...one wearing a full body armor, a magician, and a female therapist...< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;..." The man said to himself, and then made a decisive gesture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s them, spies who sneak into our country! Don’t live, bring their bodies back, and Brit will have a reward!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle started in an instant, the cavalry swooped over, their weapons were in their hands, and the adventurers had almost no time to pick up their weapons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing to do is to walk in the last Lev and Kim, gold instinctively trying to use magic, but he immediately discovered that this effort was futile, his spell Not halfway through it, Jianguang came to the top of his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lev hits a dodge gold on one shoulder and throws a knife, but hits the armor and bounces off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come on!" Following this voice, a lot of earth and stone sprayed from the ground. The strike didn't hit anyone, but it was enough to scare the horses that flew over. The first few horses raised their forefoot, and one of the knights was simply smashed down, and the cavalry behind did not hit the front. The companions circumvented on both sides, which gave five people a dodge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Wei broke, all five people got into the jungle on the side of the road. In such a place where trees are dense and vines, war horses are impossible to come in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuously came and snorted. Judging from the sound, some cavalry dismounted. Five people marched at full speed, but those damn tree vines caused them a lot of trouble. Five people had to fight with these things constantly. Wei waved a long sword to clear the way, but still could not guarantee that the companions behind him would not be picked up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone can stop." After about a hundred meters or so, Kim stopped everyone from moving on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can tell from the snoring behind you that those people have been separated by them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician began to whisper a spell, and then a burst of screams in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Viper...I was bitten!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah... I was also bitten "Help!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rewind! Hurry and retreat!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All sounds Calm down, five people looked at each other, and Lev spoke up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What to do now,"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What can I do?" Behan answered with a smile "Of course, I want to find a way to slip out of the borderline..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But first of all, get rid of those chasing soldiers!" Wei intervened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When five people came out of this jungle, the sky was nearing dusk. Strictly speaking, the woods that the five people had just drilled into were not a big forest. They did not take more than five kilometers, but they spent a full half of their time. Even with this turtle speed, their physical energy consumption is still very large. When finally coming out, even the most energetic Wei has already shown a tired look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's go!" After a short break, Lev first stood up. "Let's find a safe place to camp and rest in the front! Oh, what is this taste... bloody! Everyone is careful!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time a thick The bloody smell also ran down the wind to other people's noses. They immediately responded to this abnormal situation. Everyone took out their weapons and prepared to face any situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there was nothing in the front, so the five people carefully and slowly moved forward to the source of this terrible taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After turning over a small hill, the birthplace of bloody smell appears in everyone's field of vision - the body of the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a fierce battle that broke out not long ago, broken swords, broken armor and shields mixed in between the human body and the horse, the ground was blood Dyed into a miserable red, the entire region was rendered a tragic beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are soldiers of Leite." Kim identified the identity of these deceased from the signs on the armor. These bodies are likely to be chasing them for the first time. The army that entered the damn forest. But among the bodies of these Leite soldiers, there are other warriors who can't see the calendar. The number of them is far less than the number of Leite soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A wonderful ambush battle." Behan muttered to himself, from this battlefield, he can judge the general situation of the battle. Many of the bodies are dead under the arrows, and in frontal battles, the casualties caused by bows and arrows should not be so large. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ambushes first focused on shooting with unexpected bows and arrows, after successfully creating huge chaos - or this sudden blow to disintegrate the enemy's command system - Launch a raid and cut the Leiter cavalry into several segments to annihilate. The commander of this ambush was well controlled and annihilated the enemy with very few casualties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are people living here!" Elna made a scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attracted all partners to come around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still a person alive, although it is pressed under the body of the war horse, but this person still has consciousness, he struggled to lift half a win, looked around Five people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Brother..." The wounded made a low voice, and the magician noticed that his eyes had begun to scatter and he was going to die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't talk, let me see your wound!" Elna took a lot of effort to remove the horse that was pressing him. But after doing this job, she couldn't help but take a breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second half of this person has been separated from the upper body, and was cut by a weapon from the lower part of the waist. This injury has not been saved - Even for advanced therapists. I don't know why, this wound seems to have been burnt without a lot of bleeding, which is why this person is still not dead, but this is not lucky, but only prolonged his pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Brother... help... give me a sword..." The wounded screamed low. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behan pulled out the sword of the earth and placed the blade on the man's neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was only a trace of joy in the wounded's eyes, he had long been tortured enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you...you...brother..." He thanked him with his last strength. Behan’s hand suddenly made a force, and a sword cut his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood spurted out and splashed on Behan’s body, plating a layer of scarlet on the outside of his armor that had been worn so badly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other four people did not speak, just stood silently, and this behavior of Behan should not be cruel, it is a kind of compassion, help others to lift pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's go!" said Behan, there are so many bodies, it is impossible to bury them, they can't do anything here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five people marched along the battlefield. The battlefield stretched quite long. There were many local bodies that were piled up together, showing the fierce battle at the time. Kim estimated a little, this battle probably took away at least 2,000 lives. Maybe it was numb, and there was some sympathy and regret at the beginning, but after watching it for a long time, I felt that there was no feeling. The bloody smell that passed to the nose seemed to be slowly diminishing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
