			<div id="content">The guests have already left, and there is only one Wolf left in the hall (the undead?), and when he is also planning to leave, the door is pushed out with impoliteness, and a white figure comes in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow! What are you doing? Why not kill these people! Would you like to entertain them like this delicious and delicious? Undead Island is the site of the Necromancer The rule of the Necromancer is not human beings to kill on the island? Why? Give me a reason to explain?" Although Brett knew that Wolf was powerful, and because he broke the magic crystal ball, he was angry. This zombie mage, but at this moment, anger and heart attack can not care so much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why should I explain the reasons for what I am doing? Who are you?" I don’t know why, Wolf has a sham for this magician. For no reason, I feel uncomfortable from the first sight. For a detailed analysis, this may be because Wolf has always been a dark magician, but this young man is always wearing a luxurious white enamel robes. Although he wants to say this in his stomach, Wolf knows that there is no need to hurt this self-respecting self-respect, so he is only a cold answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have my own reasons, it’s not your business! Anyway, it’s already an exception. It’s no problem to break a few more times!” Wolff’s answer Like the cold water, it gave the cooling mind of Brett a cooling effect, reminding him of where he is talking to who he is now. After the blind impulse disappeared, Breit began to calm down. In front of him was a zombie mage who could take his life at any time, and the only thing he could rely on was the imperative who could never come to save him in time. If you really anger the undead wizard...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Wolf!" Brett softened his tone a little. "Do you know what their origins are?" Not long ago, the Sayādaw and I contacted them. They are the ones who want to block the plan of the Sayādaw. The Sayādaw asks you to kill them all, and it is best not to have a happy way!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you can't do it, you will take it out of the back. It's an old-fashioned way." Wolf thought as he thought about it while carefully measuring his patience and how many left side to answer: "Although I don't know Zun What are the festivals with these people, but I am not his executioner. If you want to kill, ask him to send his own running dog to do it!" The cold tone and the vicious words make the face of Brett white. And then turn green. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wolf! You don't want to think about who made you so powerful, let an unknown unknown magician turn into the most powerful zombie. Master, you can live without being dead, and become the supreme ruler on the island of the undead! You think that without the help of the sage, can you stand here and talk to me now? Is the wing hard, want to betray your master? If you are not a sage to help you, you are now buried in the soil to accompany your wife!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright is under shame He retaliated with the least merciless words, but at the moment he finished speaking, he began to regret, because he saw that Wolf's eyes changed, filled with a look called "violent." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha...haha...hahaha!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wolf suddenly laughed, Then suddenly the laughter was terminated. Just at the moment when the sound disappeared, the huge force lifted the cloth to the fierce and slammed into the wall. The huge pressure continued to keep, and the body of Brett could not fall down against the wall. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呜..." Brett felt that his bones had been broken. Under the pressure of this huge energy, he could not even breathe. Go, let alone move the limbs. Wolf's means was suffocating, and in one fell swoop completely dispelled Brett's resistance. His life is now pinched in the hands of the zombie mage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you know? Imp;" Wolf approached the unmovable Brett side and said in a disgusting tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Everything is a fateful arrangement. Do you think it is a very happy thing to become stronger by becoming a necromancer? No! But can't resist, Because fate has long arranged everything, my fate is destined to become a necromancer, even if there is no sage, even if I am not terminally ill, even if Kira is still alive, this can not be changed! The sage is only to complete the fate Arrange what he did, he thought he could control everything, but he was just a small spray in the irreversible torrent!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Undead The wizard stared at the magician's blue-purple face, which was changed by fear and pain. At this moment, the human face looked even more ugly than the black-faced face of the Necromancer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wolf's words ruthlessly pierced into the most fragile piece of Brett's heart like a spear, giving Brett a stronger blow than the flesh. In order to understand the opening of the seal, in order to gain more powerful power, in order not to be scornful and contemptuous, in order to retaliate against all those who are sorry for him (??), although they know that the sage is not human and the conspiracy and human beings are enemies, But Brett is still willing to be his subordinate. This choice is itself a wound that can't be healed in Breit's heart. Now the wound is ruthlessly torn by Wolf, so that he can see every drop of blood on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop!" Under the combined stimulation of anger and shame, Brett suddenly broke out with amazing power, and successfully broke away from Wolff’s “gravity transfer”. "The earth's gravity field offset caused by magic was destroyed by more powerful magical energy. The body of Brett fell, and he actually stood still without falling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What rights do you have to blame me for choosing!" In the voice of anger, Brett launched an attack, a flame with spiritual energy (Holy Yan) slammed the past with the necromancer in front. "Do you know how I feel? The power gained over the years has been annihilated in a flash, and all those past fears and admirations have turned into pity and contempt! Even the closest parents and brothers regard me as a stranger. People look at it, my brother looks at my eyes is simply to see a dog of funeral! This is the end of no power, why should I be looked down upon, why should they deprive me of the strength of years of training?!! Yes! Willing to follow the sage who is not human, because he can give me strength, more powerful power! I don't regret this choice, and I am very grateful for this opportunity. If it is not the sage, I can only pass the fence for the rest of my life. The day. The sage is using me, what does it matter? I am also using him, I use him to gain more powerful power!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a black energy ball on the hand of the husband, and the holy inflammation came from the front. The two forces began to neutralize each other at the moment of contact. After the holy flame disappeared completely, the black Energy ball left half, Wolf put the ball toward the human energy front, two people already in full combat, there is no need mercy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s stupid! Just for those boring vanity, I have abandoned my dignity! You have seen the dogs, the masters have raised their fat just to Better to call them! One day, you will regret your stupidity on the heap of corpses! Use? You also use the sage, do you think he will give you the real power?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The omnipresent magic factor, obey my call and guard my body." At the same time as the release of Holy Flame, Brett began his defensive mantra in black. When the energy ball touched his body, he had reached the guardian of the seven-star star - enough to block the defense of this devastating energy. But the next round of attacks by the Zombie Mage has arrived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...everything is decaying and falling into the dust!" The black mist was called out by magic, surrounded by a figure wearing a white robe, and Brit was desperate. Repeatedly recited the defensive spell to resist the attack that brought death, but the fog seemed to come out in an endless stream, surrounded him, and his entire body disappeared into the darkness that was as strong as the ink. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No! I can't kill him. After all, he is a human!" Wolf moved in his heart and remembered the vow he had made in front of his wife's grave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Qila! Forgive me for making this choice! For Beibei, I am going to be a necromancer, but you have to believe that even if it is no longer human, my heart will not change anything! I will always be me, absolutely unchanged! Please forgive me, I can not leave Babe A person goes with you, I can't watch her alone being abandoned in this real and cruel world! I swear by my love, even if I become a necromancer, no matter what reason, I Will not kill any human beings, no matter how damn he is! My hands will never get human blood!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black fog is getting smaller and smaller, proving that it is constantly eroding the defense of Brett, and that Brett keeps on spelling, but can't stop the stepping of this corrupt magic. Forcing, even when he himself began to despair, suddenly the black fog began to stop, no longer moving forward, it seems to have been given defensive magic  Living. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright has a sigh of relief, but he knows that Wolff’s power is not the only thing. Positive conflict is definitely no hope of victory! Since the two sides have completely broken their skins, he has no need to stay. Now the surrounding forces are maintaining a balance. It is a good opportunity to escape. There is no chance to escape without having to transfer away in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wolf! You will regret not killing me!" Brett sat in the base of the Sayādaw and swears, swears The person is not here now, but it doesn't matter. Anyway, Wolf can't escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician is lying on the bed, although the bed is really good - It's hard to understand why the undead have such a comfortable bed, knowing that they don't have the need to sleep at all - but Kim doesn't feel sleepy at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bebe’s father is the necromancer, and is the highest-ranking zombie mage? This fact has not been fully accepted by the magician. Kim has never thought of who Beibei’s father is, but he never dreamed of being a necromancer. The appearance of Wolff changed a little bit of gold's view of the Necromancer. In the past, the magician always believed that the Necromancer was a human traitor, an unforgivable guy, a magician who was engulfed by yu in order to pursue some power that humans could not reach. However, in the face of Wolf, Kim has no way to hate, even hate him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there a second way?" Kim was lying in bed and thinking about what he was doing at the time of Wolf's time. Or think that it is complete.) After considering that the magician actually found that becoming a necromancer is almost the only choice, this conclusion makes the magician feel very uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, there must be other ways!" Kim turned over and found himself a self-deceptive idea, but the next moment, a new one The problem is in the mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wood is a zombie mage, why? The zombie mage is made by the most powerful magician, that is, the big magician, but in the current decline of magic, there are only three big magisters on the whole continent, is there a fourth? No, no, if he has the strength of the big magister, he must have been famous for the mainland, and his name (obviously not a pseudonym or pseudonym) is absolutely never heard by the magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, how did he remove my thunderbolt?" When he thought of the magician, Kim immediately remembered the magic, because it happened. Too many accidents, Kim has forgotten that the curse was cracked by Wolf. It’s incredible to think about it now! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did Wolff eliminate the squad? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too many questions circling in the mind of Kim, it seems that there is no way to sleep this evening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black fog suddenly rose, Wolf appeared on the side, the magician just wanted to stand up and found that his hands and feet were tied tightly, unable to move . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to do?" I wanted to talk in my heart, but Kim found that his tongue was firmly stuck by something and could not move at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wood ignored him and turned to start his ritual. Although he had never seen this ritual, Kim knew what the magic ritual was for, this is Mankind turns into the evil magic of the Necromancer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The struggle of gold is desperate, but the rope tied to the body firmly binds his freedom and makes him unable to move. He looks at Wolfe with despair. Through the body - all the preparations for the ceremony have been completed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Join us!" There was an evil and awkward smile on Wolf's black face. He was lifted to the central altar when Kim could not resist. On, the magic array began to appear, and Kim knew that after a while, he would become a necromancer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No! Don't!" I don't know when the sound can come out again. Kim said loudly, "Stop, I don't want to be a necromancer!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why not? Want to get more powerful power is not your ideal? You can achieve this by becoming a necromancer!" Under this question, the magician suddenly I found myself unable to answer this question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Begin!" Wolf began to recite the spell. When this long spell ends, Kim will complete the transition from human to undead wizard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No!" The magician burst into a big bang and then woke up. When he finally saw the surroundings, he saw that Lev was using concern. With a confused look at myself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing, nothing!" The magician touched his forehead, only to find that it was all sweat, "just made a nightmare!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leif lay down Going back, years of habits allow him to judge the time, and now there is still a little time in the morning, and you can sleep for a little longer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, this is just a dream!" the magician said to himself, just as he was about to lie down again, he suddenly found himself looking forward to it. I hope that this dream will continue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the way, I haven’t asked the Necromancer what to do with the Dark Holy Grail. Before returning to sleep, the magician remembered a doubt in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good friends! Breakfast is ready! Please use it slowly." "Standing at the table, Wolff spoke to everyone with no change in tone." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you not eat?" After saying this, Lev understood his stupidity - the Necromancer had no need to eat at all, and Wolf was only yesterday. Just accompany them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wolf laughed, he sat down, but did not eat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For Mr. Wolf..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Call me, Wolf! It’s called me like this!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“That...Wolf, I want to ask, how did you become a necromancer... ah... no No... Don't misunderstand, I want to say, why I have never heard of such a powerful magician... Although I am not very strong myself, I know that I lost the names of almost all powerful mages on the mainland... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know!" Wolf's smile has not changed at all. "You want to ask me why I am not famous when I am a human being, right? The answer is actually Very simple, because I was just an ordinary magician before becoming a Necromancer, a little higher than your level, I am a great magician!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" However!" Wolff continued, "How do I become a zombie mage? Please be my personal secret. Don't ask again?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;& Nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere was silent, but the magician quickly thought of his second question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wolf..., I want to know how you eliminated the thunderbolt yesterday, the power of the curse is..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, there is nothing! There is only a curse to deal with the curse! But young people, you are really rash, even use the curse, your teacher did not tell you the curse Terrible? If it wasn't a curse, you shouldn't use the curse at all, it would be suicide! I didn't actually do anything, I just used a curse 'empty crack', one used to open the space The magic that devours everything is very dangerous if it is used for attack, but it is just right to deal with the type of curse that other energy slowly accumulates!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" If you also want to learn more curses, there are books in this library in the temple that can be shown to you - if you really want to learn this dangerous magic. However, "Wolf Suddenly smiled again. "I don't think it is necessary, gold!" Wolf However, to increase the volume, the magician was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's the matter!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One person yesterday - more precisely, a dead soul The wizard came to me, he asked me to tell you, I must go to him!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be nervous! Don't worry, he should not be malicious! "Wolf looked at the nervous look of the adventurer and smiled even more." He is the only zombie mage on this undead island except me, but unlike me who has just become a necromancer every few years, his age is almost The biggest one here!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about other zombie mage?" Behan couldn’t help but ask, in the Holy Light dynasty, there were quite a few The magician has become a zombie mage, and these people will not all disappear and disappear! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All died in the hands of the dragons during the Undead War! Do you know why he is still there? Because he is the only one who did not participate in the Undead War. Necromancer!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, after the Necromancer decided to fight the human race, he left the temple and found a place to hide in the undead island. For this reason, other necromancers still refuse to forgive him..." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why did he do this?" Elna interrupted Wolf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because he insists that the Necromancer is a part of humanity, it does not matter if you fight, but you cannot take the means of extinction!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What did he do with me?" Kim then asked him what he was most concerned about. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not very clear, but it should not be a bad thing! He has been alone for so long, no matter what happens, he will be very enthusiastic, you can rest assured. !"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the course of the conversation and question and answer, the breakfast was eaten unconsciously, and the gold put down the tableware and asked the last question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wolf first... I want to ask what the Dark Holy Grail is used for?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wolf paused, as if thinking about how to answer this question, but he quickly said: "The Holy Grail also has A lot of power is not known, and we can only use it to make dark knights!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dark Knight?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, relying on the power of the Holy Grail can resurrect the body. Although it is not really resurrected, it can be stronger than when it is alive. At the same time, it has the advantages of humans and soldiers, and then put on special armor. Can be a very powerful warrior - in addition to the slow manufacturing speed, there is no place to pick can be, and in order to increase mobility, we also create a group of horses in the same way while making the Dark Knight. In fact, the only magician group that can pose a threat to the Dark Knight is - But that is also a limited threat. However, this is not the most important!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not the most important?" Except for Behan, others are not wars. I know very well, so no one knows the shock of this former mercenary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An army that does not know the fear, does not know the fatigue, can endure any natural conditions, and is absolutely loyal, especially the powerful individual combat capability (this is also 骷髅The only weakness of the soldiers)! ! ! ? ? ? Those zombie warhorses can provide the strongest maneuverability, and those armor—now anyone inferring the use of those armor—can provide the highest level of defense, plus almost no need for logistical support, if such an army If you participate in a war, it is simply irresistible! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behan’s mind has a little outline, and the Necromancer’s revenge on humans is based on a huge squadron, with an elite dark knight as an assault The power, coupled with the powerful magic of the Necromancer, is a backup. I really don’t know whether humans with scattered power and internal contradictions can resist the attack of such an undead army...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "The creation of the Dark Knight is the only way we can actively expand our ethnic group!" Wolff's words pulled Behan back from fantasy, reminding him that the leader of the Necromancer is now an enemy of humanity. Wolf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the process of making the Dark Knight, about a thousand of them can maintain the wisdom of life, although they lost their memories, but they are not the only ones. I will listen to my life, but have my own thoughts and wisdom. Although I don’t know how to describe them, they are indeed the same in nature as our necromancers. So we accept them and regard them as one of us. Now, we all use the undead knight to call them..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s ironic that the human army has worked hard to turn soldiers into obedient puppets, but the Necromancers are Doing the opposite, is this because there are too many thoughts among human beings and the undead are too much obedient?" Behan thought in his heart, but he also knows that for the necromancer, this has How important is the undead knight of his own thoughts. The number of undead wizards is an Achilles heel that they cannot overcome. Especially when they start war, they cannot complete their own army because of the number limit. Start, taking a multipronged approach to achieve better strategic initiatives. The existence of the Undead Knight can just make up for this deficiency. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Active?" Kim’s heart moved, and he suddenly remembered his dream. "Wood, can't you use forced means to turn a human magician into a necromancer?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? You don't know? Being a necromancer and signing a covenant with God must be successful in a completely voluntary situation, and even a little hesitation will not work!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "That's it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, Kim, I have something to talk to you alone! Can you come with me?" The husband stood up from the chair and the magician promised to go out with the zombie mage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Everyone, I am sorry, although this is very rude, please don't go around in this place, otherwise it may cause unpleasant things!" Before going out Wolf turned and said to other people still sitting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, why is Babe not?" After Kim and Wolf went out, Elna suddenly remembered the problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I won't have to get up yet!" Lev ate the last bite of food casually and replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician followed Wolfe into an ordinary room, this room It’s much simpler than the ones I saw along the way, and it’s not very compatible with that luxurious corridor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's the matter?" Kim saw that Wolf had stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gold! I want to ask you one thing? Do you want to be a necromancer? Don't misunderstand, I am not threatening or have any intention of forcing, I just want to Asking if you want to be a necromancer, I have a way to make you a zombie mage right away, so that you can get the power you would have spent in your lifetime?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"???...Sorry, but I think, my hope is to rely on my own efforts to get better! Unfortunately, I can't accept your kindness!" Jin side is carefully Considering the awkward question of Wolf, he responded by sending words and sentences. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm sorry! It seems that fate is destined to be impossible to change!" Wolf whispered, and the voice was low only to see. "Sorry, I raised this topic and forgot what I just said! Right, young man, this thing is for you!" Wolf took out a book from his body. "I was originally a guest, I should do my best." The hospitality, I should have invited you to read it in my library, but under the opposition of other necromancers, I can't do this. I can only give you this book as a souvenir."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold received the book, this book is very new, is a manuscript that has just been done soon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have carefully selected it in the library! As a gift for our farewell, there are some magic that have been lost outside. But maybe this is my extra action, you may not be able to use it!" Although Wolff's last sentence is very room for proof, but The magician did not notice it now, because Wolf immediately asked a question that attracted his full attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you offend the Supreme?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sir?" The magician is this The words were shocked. Since the first time I saw the Sayādaw, the guy seemed to be everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although it’s boring, I think you are a trustworthy person, so I’ll tell you specifically. You have to be careful about that guy, that guy has a big Ambition. It is the way he taught me to become a necromancer, so I can use my hand to draw the undead wizards. He also retrieved the Holy Grail of the Artifact for us, and taught us how to make the Dark Knight! Now the Necromancer The power is growing stronger. If you continue to do so, you won’t have to spend another 20 years. It’s likely that a second undead war will break out!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“What?” I’m not sure, The hand of the Sayādaw actually stretched so long that even the necromancers did not let go. It seems that the dragon and the half-orc are not the only targets of the Sayādaw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not long ago, he borrowed about 10,000 Dark Knights from me, and he didn't seem to want to return anything else. It is this power that can cause a great threat!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why should you lend him?" King Kong wants to ask, but immediately presses the words Going on, after all, Wolf is going to face a lot of pressure. He can't do anything according to his own wishes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Everyone, goodbye!" Wolf sent the pedestrian to the door of the temple. When he was leaving, Kim found that he did not see Babe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, babe?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She has a few other things, rest assured I will not make the mistakes of the past, I will take care of her! Thank you again for bringing her back. And, I can see it, you take care of her very well, since her mother died, I have I haven't seen her so energetic for a long time! Thanks again!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When watching the group leave, Wolf also hurried to a room in the temple Go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, you said that the zombie mage is looking for us?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wrong, not looking for us, it is looking for gold!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician launched a new map that Wolf gave them, and the zombie mage lived in the distance to the temple. There is probably a beach next to a palm tree forest for three days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, Kim, what the sage who just wolf told you is going on, even though humans dominate the mainland, but also There is no threat to other races, right? What hatred does the demon have with humans? Why do you have to be embarrassed with humans? And, if we go back and tell them about the Sayādaw, would anyone believe it?” Lev issued A series of questions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know, after all, we are just a group of ordinary adventurers, we can only do our best, if things go beyond the scope of our capabilities, we can't help. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I suddenly missed Babe a little! Although I sometimes felt annoyed when she was there, she felt very empty when she left! The dragon tooth dagger that was supposed to be given to her now seems to have no way to give it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, are we considered to have completed the commission?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Undead Island has turned around, so it doesn't count, what counts?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; I was spent in this conversation along the way, but the magician is an exception. He has been reading this magic book that Wolf gave him. In fact, he is completely fascinated, and everyone has seen this. So I didn't bother him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is completely dark, everyone else is already asleep, though They are still on the undead island where humans see death, but Wolf has told them that they are absolutely safe here, so the adventurers did not arrange a vigil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician closes the book in his hand and destroys him by providing him with a warm bonfire and a light ball of light, then slowly sighs Tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every magician knows that the power of magic comes from two aspects, one is the magic of the magician himself, and the other is the magic spell he has mastered. The best of both is complemented by the fact that the level of magic and the knowledge of the spell are at the same level. This situation is the best, but Kim is now just not in this optimal state. He has learned too many spells from the elders of the dragon, and now what he lacks is the magic, enough to support the magic of these spells - and the magic has no shortcuts to improve (at least he does not know), only constant practice and actual combat Can be improved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last powerful spells in the magic book that Wolf gave him are beyond the magical burden of gold now, that is, using Old Locke to teach him The method is barely used, and the true power of these magics cannot be exerted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it really strong?" Kim looked at his hands with the last rays of the light ball that was slowly extinguished, maybe his power It really got stronger, but this gradual process is something he can't feel carefully. "Even if it is stronger, it is far worse than the teacher!" The magician sighed, but did not think about the age difference between him and his teacher - they could be enough for six or seventy years! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is already silence, the silence in the darkness, the magician groping into his tent, but he can't sleep, although he knows the power Not enough, but there is a desire in his heart, an impulse to display all the powerful spells that he knows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is there really no shortcut?" The magician remembered Wolfe's words. If he promised to come down at the time, he may now become a powerful zombie mage of the same level as the teacher. Is this a shortcut? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is the mysterious zombie mage looking for me?" A new idea has gotten into the mind of the magician. This is really strange. No matter how gold is searched, he can't remember when he had any contact with the zombie mage. In fact, before coming to Undead Island, Kim had never touched the Necromancer. After coming to Undead Island, he had not seen any zombie mage other than Wolf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The zombie mage should be nothing malicious! The situation should indeed be similar to what Wolf said. If there is anything malicious, he does not need to contact them through Wolf. They just need to wait for them on the way they have finished. Wolf said that the zombie mage is the undead. A special existence on the island, the existence of being rejected by other necromancers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chaotic thoughts turned around in a tired mind with no results, and then all smashed under the attack of sleep, Kim is like everyone else. Into a deep sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A powerful hand woke the magician from his sleep, and after sitting in a reflective position, the magician found that Wei was awake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Don’t talk!” Wei said to him that he could only reconcile the sound. He was already armed. “There are uninvited guests coming! Be prepared!” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the magician climbed out of the tent, his companions were all ready. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are about eight to ten cavalry, all of which are heavy cavalry. Fortunately, the sound of their hooves is too loud, otherwise we will be attacked in our sleep. Behan explained to everyone that he just noticed the sound that was unnatural in the silence when he went out to solve the problem, so that the adventurer had time to prepare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the attackers stormed into this small camp, the first wave of their weapons and magic only destroyed some tents and sleeping gear, then The four balls of light appeared above the camp and fully revealed the appearance of the attackers. Unsurprisingly, they were eight dark knights and three necromancers - two ghost wizards and one monk. The magician created the illusion of life with magic before everyone left, letting the undead people think that they are still sleeping in the camp. Fortunately, the necromancers don't know military knowledge. If they put the horse's hooves on the hoof or the straw to reduce the sound before they attack, I am afraid that the night attack will be successful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything is clear, no need to say more, the battle begins immediately, Behan’s sword of the earth is the first to launch an attack, a zombie horse is washed from the ground The energy that came up hit a fight, fell to the ground, and pressed the knight on its back under the body. However, due to the protection of the thick vest, the body of the zombie horse did not destroy this powerful energy. Kim did not lose the opportunity to launch his own trap. Although the time was short, the magician set a trap to deal with the trap of the Dark Knight - if the undead had the opportunity to combine the power of steel and magic, The adventurers have almost no hope of victory. The sturdy ground suddenly began to loosen, and like a quicksand, began to devour the overly heavy armor that wrapped the body. The hoofs of the zombie horses were trapped, and the armor they used to protect their bodies became their greatest burden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The initiative of the battle is now in the hands of the adventurer, when the intruder just tried to start the counterattack, a moth-like World of Warcraft Come over, the target of the attack is the three necromancers. Accompanied by Warcraft, it is the holy inflammation that can restrain the necromancer. This double blow makes the necromancer wrestle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wolf walked into this wide room and everything was ready Now, since he understood his own goals, he began to prepare for this matter. Now is the time for everything to end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This room is the middle of the entire Pluto temple, almost the most powerful place in the world where Pluto is the most powerful, every corner of the room They are all engraved with magic characters. If you let an unidentified magician study these things, it may take three years to decide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very large magical array, perhaps a collection of dozens of magical arrays. Each step of the zombie mage uses his own power to trigger a part of it. The power of the magical array, the original meaningless symbols began to reveal the power that they really contained under the driving of magical energy. The energy began to stir in this space, and began to slowly concentrate in the center of the room in a vortex. Along with the actions of the zombie mage, these forces are concentrated faster and more powerful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there is a body lying on the altar, the body of a little girl! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war began to slowly change, after all, for the magician alone Even with the help of Warcraft, the three Necromancers were a little too much. After recovering from the panic caused by the initial surprise attack, the Necromancers began to fight back. The partners are fighting, although the eight Dark Knights are temporarily trapped by the magic trap, but the remaining three are still terrible enemies. The terrible chopping of their scimitars did not even dare to pick them up, and the speed and flexibility of their horses allowed them to easily get rid of the adventurers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sorcerer used the black energy ball to catch every attack of the magician, and a ghost mage kept using the wind, fire, and thunder. The power of the game gives the flying World of Warcraft a blow, while another Ghost Master is constantly calling for the cold air - a level of freezing that is ineffective for the undead and a significant effect on humans. Every adventurer can see the layer of frost on his body under the light of the ball of light. The cold slows down the human movement without affecting the agility of the Dark Knight. This magic has another effect. ─ ─ Under the influence of magical power, it becomes very soft and the ground begins to slowly freeze. After a while, the trapped dark knight can jump out of this unconventional trap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Would the Wolff come to chase us?" No, this thought was immediately overthrown. If Wolff wants to kill them, there is no need to use it. With so many hands and feet, these should be other necromancers who are not willing to let them leave, and in order not to let Wolf find it, they only brought eight Dark Knights (if you bring hundreds of them, the adventurer There are not many movies to sing well.) <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Abominable!" In the roar, Wei Fenli slammed forward and finally stabbed the sword from the dark knight's armor and the gap in the helmet. Under the combined effect of the power of this sword and the impact of the zombie warhorse, the entire head of the Dark Knight was cut down, but this did not prevent this dark Knight without head from slashing out to the other therapist. A knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can't you kill?" Wei found that his hands didn't feel the impact of the sword just now. It is obvious that his hand is frozen and vindictive. It allows him to resist any direct attack of magic, but he can't resist the change in temperature caused by this magic. In fact, due to the cold effect, everyone's movements become dull, but if they can't get rid of these dark knights as quickly as possible, they can't support the magician, and they can't attack the necromancer, then the cold will not stop. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What should I do?" The magician keeps on using the holy inflammation. I was forced to use my brain while trying to control the Master. But at the moment, he seems to have no other way. He only hopes that his companions will quickly pick up the three Dark Knights to help him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Young people, have you ever been beaten?" A sound that exists in the mind of a magician directly appears in a very Speaking in a mocking tone. "With such a big advantage, why not quickly turn it into a victory? Do you have to wait until your advantage is completely lost to prove your strength?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "What advantage, I am struggling now... Who? Who is talking to me?" The magician reacted and tried to search for the source of this mysterious voice, but this effort was futile, except for the Necromancer and the Dark Knight. Besides, there are no other suspicious things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh??" The sarcasm of the voice once again reached the mind of the magician. "You don't see how much advantage you have now?" This can really not match your performance! Didn't you notice it? Why did the Master of the Skull take special defense, and the Phantom Master will summon it with this large-scale freeze that consumes a large effect and is not obvious?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The effect is not obvious?" Kim looked at the companions who were slow due to the cold, and the range of the frozen air had already affected himself. The magician has already begun. I feel that my mouth is a bit numb - now I can basically judge the owner of this voice is not malicious, otherwise there is no need to gossip with him, directly involved in the hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He clearly has been vacant, why not attack you or other people directly? That may be more effective directly!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"???" "You haven't noticed yet? The ghost mage is now 'seeing'? The ghost mage is not looking at things in the usual sense of vision. He can't tell you and you create it. The illusion of the difference! And the sorcerer was forced to take a full defensive in order to protect his companion from your deadly sacred attack! The ghost mage who fought Warcraft has been completely restrained, and another ghost mage is because You can't distinguish the difference between life and life illusion, and you must balance the attack and rescue the dark knights who fall into the trap, so use the impractical magic of summoning the frozen air! On the surface they are okay, in fact they are very embarrassed The state, as long as you add strength, they can't afford it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stupid, why should we be limited to holy inflammation? Holy inflammation is really powerful, but now they are specifically strengthening the defense against this attack! If you do not continue to attack each other's weaknesses, you will never be able to grasp the opportunityDon't fight first, look at the way your companion fights over there, and see if they use brute force and enemy to fight hard. If the soldiers fighting with muscle fighting know that it is not the enemy's weapon but the enemy's body. Don't you know that this magician who fights with his mind doesn't know? Being stuck in the success of past battles without changing them can only lead to failure! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! This roar seems to be a bucket of water on his head, and the magician realizes that his battle was just boring with the Master." Expelling each other's magic power, Kim immediately understood what he was going to do, he no longer continued to launch the holy inflammation, turned and used a powerful pyrocalic wave to shoot the dark knights trapped by magic traps that could not be dodged at all.The heavy black armor can't defend against the hot magical heat. Because of the thermal conduction of steel, the charred smell of the flesh is immediately released. Although the Dark Knight and their zombie horses will not feel pain, they will not issue. What a painful cry, but in the flame, they will still become immobile coke<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;骷髅The Master stood still, his empty eyes looked at the magician, seemingly hesitating whether he wanted to attack this opportunity, but he knew that this human must Already prepared for defensive magic, he is not sure to kill this man.And this human being will undoubtedly smash the gap created by his attack with St. Yan, and the damn holy sin can have a fatal threat to his companions. He also has no confidence to restore the defense in time to resist the holy sac.After weighing the pros and cons, the Master gave up the opportunity to attack.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now it’s the turn of the magician to take the plunge, a ghost mage is held back by Warcraft (even if it is not held down), the other is playing The magic that will work immediately, and the sorcerer is afraid of the threat of San Yan to his companions and can't change the defensive posture. The magician can now attack the dark knights who are fighting with their companions unscrupulously, and he deliberately uses those who are not very Strong magic to show his attention to the sorcerer did not leave him<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leif shrinks his body and lets the Dark Knight’s scimitar just pass over the top of his head. It’s really dangerous. It’s still so bad if you don’t have a head, fortunately. There are only three, if there are more than one, then you can hide.The headless knight rushed over and then turned the horse's head to do the second charge, but this accident happened. Just when the horse had not fully turned around, a dazzling light hit the horse and the bare armor was exposed. With a few hooves, the hoof immediately turned into a black carbon, and the three hooves could not maintain the balance of the heavy body. The three-legged zombie horse fell to the ground with the headless dark knight, and they looked like they I can't stand up.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining two Dark Knights are still fighting, their kind of charge - turning the horse's head - the rhythm of the charge is very good for the walking adventurer Effective tactics, but encountering magic is another matter. Several fireballs hit them when they turned their horses. Although they didn’t knock them down, the air was full of iron barbecue. The taste when roastingAlthough the Dark Knight itself was only mechanically obeying the command, and did not know how to change the tactics, but the Master realized the crisis, he began to command the two Dark Knights to attack the magician.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two Dark Knights gave up the target of the original attack and began to run to the magician, but the magician released a horizontal wind blade one after another, specifically The hoof that only reveals a little outside the armorIn the case that the terrain is not very flat, this level of wind blade will soon be exhausted, but the dark knight who has dealt with these momentums is just right. Both zombie horses have lost their forefoot and put them on their backs. The knight fell to the ground like a stakeThings are not finished yet, although the horse has fallen, but the knights still stand up, but their terrible, only the defense, but not the second half of the coordination of the armor became a natural obstacle to their actions.Although the rides can't be seen right away, when they dismount, they are slow-moving like iron puppets, and the excessively large weapons further hinder their actions. The magician does not have to be afraid, because these iron puppets advance. The speed can't keep up with the speed at which he slowly retreats.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei Chong is a little closer, puts on a posture, and throws out a sword style. The skill of Jianfeng is not suitable for application during the melee, because It is easy to hurt oneself and it will create a large defensive gap because of excessive movement, but it is very suitable at this time. The slow-moving dark knight can neither hide nor know to hide. Divided into two halves from the middle<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this whole battle, the sorcerer tried to attack with magic several times, but he also noticed that the magician used is not particularly powerful and needs full strength. The magic of going, this shows that this man still retains the power of defense and even counterattack while fighting.The cherishment of the companion became a shackle that the sorcerer could not see. He could not give up the protection of his companions and fight hard. As a result, he could only see the magician clean up the three dark knights.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
