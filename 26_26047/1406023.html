			<div id="content">"It's okay? Isn't that the law is not to say that the high priests are forbidden when others pray?" Lev asked without hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reassured? This is just a ritual. I used to secretly go in when she prayed. It doesn't matter. The so-called prayer actually doesn't have you. Think so sacred and undisturbed!" Elna replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two of them have now come to the vicinity of the inner door, watching the three guards far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it so urgent? I mean... I will go see her after the ceremony..." Lev still hesitated. After all, here is the temple, a sacred place. This has caused the daring thieves to have some concerns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't worry, mom won't be angry...unless she is not happy with you!" Elna replied casually. Lev deliberately ignored the latter half of the sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inner temple and the front hall are completely different architectural styles. The front hall is said to be a magnificent and magnificent, and the fine carvings are enough for one person to look at the three days. Any new visitors will be overwhelmed by the majesty of the building, creating awe. The inner hall is very simple, the ceiling, the floor, the walls, all of which are variegated marbles, without any artificial carvings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do we get in?" Lev looked at it and knew that it was impossible to completely sneak through the guards unless he used violence or other means to get those The guards temporarily relax. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassured, I know a safe route!" Elna showed a mysterious smile, "a ventilation duct that allows me to pass." She looked at it. One of the following husbands’ bodies, then went on to say, “You should have no problem.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vents passed smoothly, when two people went out from this passage By the time, they have come to a relatively dark lobby. There is a window near the ceiling, but I don't know who brought the curtains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Here is the inner temple?" Lev looked around, darker around, but couldn't stop the thief's gaze. It is more simple than the entrance to the inner hall. The only difference is that there are many patterns and symbols on the walls made of luminous stones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, but it is not a destination yet!" Erna pulled him, "Follow me!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two left the lobby and turned to a small door next to them. Elna knocked at the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My mom’s place to live," the therapist made a The action of forbidding the sound, "Even in the inner hall, only the identity talents above the auxiliary sacrifice can enter and exit at will! Don't be loud, if it is discovered, it will be finished! The teacher of the law is very rigid, and he is caught by him. No one wants to say anything!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mom...I am...Irna!" Waiting for a while, I don’t see Echo, Aier Na then shouted softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is still motionless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time passed by in the silence, then Elna couldn’t help it, she began to push the door hard and whispered "Mom It’s me... open the door!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door looks thin, but it’s exceptionally strong and can’t be pushed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An unpredictable hunch appeared in the hearts of two people at the same time, and Erna turned and looked to the outside to confirm that there is no one in the inner hall now, then she suddenly Throw a fist and forcefully hit the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge anti-shock force shook the entire body of the therapist. When her fist touched the door, a light was transmitted from the door, ruthless Give her all her strength back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah..." Falling Alna looked at this incredible thing. At this moment, a symbol on the door is shining, it is a magical symbol. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened?" Elna rushed to the right hand of her own. What I have just neglected now can be seen clearly. On the door, there are a series of magic crystals, which are composed of a small magical array to protect the door from any external force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Impossible! There is no magic in this temple - except for healing, other magic is forbidden... Mom must have something!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The count’s dinner is really a big deal. From the gold position, his sides are filled with women. There are fifteen or sixteen flowers like jade on both sides. This is the second time that Kim has been dining at this long table – the first time it was accepted by Wolf on Undead Island – but this time the table really played its full potential. Together with Wei and Li Si, this table has been fully utilized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behan is sitting opposite the gold--in fact, several of them have already used the meal, now it’s just a symbolic snack--he is carrying The incomparable expression faces the table and flirts with it. The father did not respect his position at all, and he still did not hide it in front of his friends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lisi’s small mouth is eating, she looks at the performance of the Lord’s Earl and his wife from time to time, and then looks at the face of Behan’s face. . Her gaze further increased the prominence of Behan's forehead blue veins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I actually believe this stinky old man is really crazy!" He said to himself more than once in his heart. The temper of this lascivious old man has never been changed. If he has changed in so many years, it is that the color is getting bigger and bigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This meal is finally over, and Behan is simply the escape from the room, and then he goes directly to his father’s study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was quickly opened, and a man who was a father came in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Smelly old man! What do you mean by this?" Behan is simply stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you mean!" The count still responded with his unbreakable expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can't eat seriously, must you make me so shameful?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" You mean to show the real side to others, do not deliberately disguise as a shameful face?" This old and savage sophistry suddenly made Behan unable to speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Would you like this if your mother is still there?" Behan yelled out, but regretted the exit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smile on the count’s face disappeared, his face turned blue, and he looked at the son in front of him. That kind of person and demeanor is not so much a person as a zombie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your mother..." he said in a word, "She is still..." His face was filled with a layer for Behan Feeling sad, "She is still... she is still..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Count of Fatt suddenly jumped up, grabbed the curtains around him, and tried hard Just pull it down. Then he swept all the books on the bookshelf next to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s all my fault! My fault!" He yelled hysterically and then punched the glass. When the window shattered, his hand became bloody. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop! Dad!" Behan rushed up and hugged his father. "Don't be like this, everything is gone!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is gone! It's my fault!" The count squirmed desperately, but he struggled with his son. It was pressed to the chair by Behan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't be like this, Dad! Quiet!" Under the strong suppression of his son, the old count slowly calmed down. Behan let go of his hand and let his father lean against the back of the chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing, Dad..." He poured a glass of wine in front of his father, who lifted the cup and drank it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The father and son were silent for a while, then the father spoke first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have something that I want you to do. You know that the temple is about to start a three-year festival, and I decided to donate a property. I originally planned Go in person, but since you are back, you will be there for me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's good, since I can't live a few more years, then I will be a little more happy..." The count laughed, but the smile was a little stubborn. "It seems that I have to be a few more..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You dare, dead old man!" Behan turned his face and turned his back to his father. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You still agree... my son!" The old count went behind his son and took a look at Behan’s shoulder. "Let me go." You also don't want your old and sick father to be tired of traveling again?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good! I am going!" Behan gnashed his teeth to this "old age." The father of the disease said. Then he turned and walked to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right!" Before Behan went out, the voice of Count Fate came over. "You must leave that half-leprechaun girlfriend, save You are running away from home like the last time, and it is very expensive to entrust the adventurer's union to inquire about your news!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Count of Fatt is a large sculpture to be given to the temple. It is carved from the famous ore produced by Stoding, Qingfeng Stone, and decorated with various colored stones. The content of the sculpture is a lady of the bouquet - if you carefully distinguish it, you will find that the woman's face and Behan have some similarities, and it is not known whether the sculpture of Behan's mother is a model. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sculpture is now placed on a giant car of twenty horses. Next to the sculpture, three friends are working together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry... let you see that." Behan said with some frustration. "In fact, Dad used to be very good. Since my mother died, Slowly become like that..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's wrong with it?" Wei Luwei asked somewhat strangely, and he met Behan's surprised look. Do you mean that he has married a lot of wives? Is there anything wrong with this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is this normal?" This made Behan feel surprised. . "The whole fifteen...not many, too much!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But since they are all acceptable, what is your embarrassment?" Wei still The face was puzzled, and Behan’s head almost hit the carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behan turned his face to gold, but the golden eye only agreed with Wei. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't say it, I can't tell you!" Behan dressed up and turned his face, but felt a bit of comfort in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temple and the Studdin distance are not too far, just two days away, they have arrived at this garden called "Leica" Grass. The temple is far away, although according to the old experience of the coachman, they are still two days away from the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know how Lev and Elna are..." I don't know who suddenly said this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This problem is exactly what three people want to avoid now, although everyone tells them that they should not have any problems - according to a soldier He saw the thief and the therapist together - but in that case, nothing could be guaranteed, and no one would dare to say that he was sure to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reassure, they have nothing to do!" Kim’s loud encouragement, although he did not speak much, "They must have been waiting for us in the temple. !"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two days passed quickly, the temple and the temple The market is now in sight. The voice of the voice over there can already be seen. As expected by Behan, there is no place in the market where you can accommodate such a supercar - in fact, even if no one can pass this car - it seems that they only have to park the car first. Outside, then report inside the temple. Count Fade had already informed the temple in advance of the news, so he only gave his son a car and a few grooms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When I saw this place, I remembered the Delft's contest!" Behan couldn't help but sigh when he jumped off the carriage. At that time, the competition in the competition made the city of Delante so crowded that it was really only comparable here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that when we met Babe, it was in this situation!" Jin, who was at the forefront, suddenly turned and said to Wei behind him. Sometimes I really miss the little girl. To be honest, traveling with her is really a good memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I doubt if she will suddenly jump from the sky and fall on us!" Behan smiled and picked up the words. Now the little girl is probably on the side of her father on Undead Island. In that environment, I don’t know how to live a little girl, maybe she will think of another way to slip out of the island - just like last time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Catch her!" A burst of noise came from afar. "She can't run!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Unable to catch!" Another child answered with a loud voice, which was particularly clear in this noisy sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look and see!" The people around me began to stir up, and everyone turned to look at the sky. Kim also turned his head, but what he saw was only a shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little beast holding the girl's body loosens the paw, letting the girl's body fall freely, and the target is obviously the magician that it does not like. Its revenge was successful. The little girl’s feet were in the face and shoulders of the gold. The magician had no chance at all. This heavy impact knocked him down to the ground and his face was still on the girl’s face. A shoe... Fortunately, this foot is not the center of gravity, so it is not very heavy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a glimpse of Venus in the blink of an eye. After these damn stars are swept away, Kim is angry and climbs up. Who is he who provokes? Actually, I was so careless...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The magician brother... I haven't seen you for a long time!" Babe raised a hand and smiled at Mimi's gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s silent all around, it seems that all the sounds are gone, and Kim’s watch is on the daughter of this sudden undead wizard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Babe...you...what are you here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fat The man had already squeezed into the field at this time, and he grabbed the gold sleeves! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you know this girl?" The man said eagerly, wiping the sweat on his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes... What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pay money, twelve silver coins! The girl and her pet have eaten so many things, but they have not paid for it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden turned to look at Babe, while the latter put on a pair Poor look. "This is not Beibei's fault. It is strange to blame the fat boss for selling something that is too good..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Babe, how did you come?" After finally passing through the most dense area of ​​the crowd, Behan asked the little girl. Although it is a happy thing to meet again, it is a bit strange that this thing is happening. They are saying that Babe and Babe are coming out, as if they were pre-ambushed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Undead Island is too boring...so I sneak out and play!" Little girl has now climbed back to Wei’s shoulder, no matter what Wei No use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behan looked at the little girl and had no smile before, and suddenly there was a feeling of not being right in the heart, but it felt like the joy of being met again soon. Covered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How did you come out?" Jin asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not very clear... just came here. There are so many people here! And the fat boss is doing something very good, but I forgot Bring money..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So you let the baby pull you to fly to escape?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have no way... I will not be beaten if I don't escape! You don't know how fat the boss is at that time!" Babe said nothing at all, and he was justified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It flew back on its own!" Babe said proudly. "It likes me very much..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that in order to prove Babe’s words, the young dragon flies On Lev's shoulder, sticking out his tongue and licking his face, but the feeling of faintness just made Behan resent. He rubbed his face with his hand, but this move did not make him feel much better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Have you come back?" Wei asked strangely. It sounds a bit unbelievable. How can the dragon elders put such a dragon in random and run around? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, it suddenly came to me one day!" Babe replied. "Ah! So tall... higher than my family!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four people have come to the foot of the temple, and this question has come to an end. The three people didn't ask for anything, or they didn't want to carefully interrogate the little girl who obviously didn't know much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two guards at the end of the stairs blocked this strange combination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am the son of the Count of Stodofate, giving my father a good idea for the big ceremonies of this temple!" Behan came forward, very Politely performed a ceremony and made a self-introduction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah! It turned out to be the son of Count Count Fate!" The guard hurried back. "We have been waiting for a long time! Please go here... yes, the one mentioned by the Earl..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, because there are too many people It is not convenient to ship it directly, so I stopped at the market and was guarded by my driver."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah... It is not very convenient now... These are?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are my companions." Behan answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guard looked at Babe with a slight suspicion, but did not say anything, turned and took them to a small door to the left of the main entrance of the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We must find a magician!" Elna pondered for a while, Then he said to Lev in a slap in the air. They have left the inner hall and are discussing what to do in a corridor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But where to find a reliable magician?" Lev indulged in this problem. Of course, Kim is the best candidate, but now the guy doesn't know where it is... and, in the case of the defeat, even his safety is almost impossible to determine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right!" The two men clamored for each other and remembered one person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wounded in the front hall! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Successful?" The therapist stood by and looked at The hard work of the group of magicians. Even if he doesn't know much about magic, he can see that the situation is not as good as he thinks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No! Adults, we are not strong enough!" A magician stopped and called the Fas. "I don't know why, our strength has weakened. By our words, probably can't be completed before the scheduled time!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know why!" Looked at the half-finished magic array. "Here is the temple of the goddess of life. All other powers are greatly limited here! Except for the healing will be enhanced here, all other magic will be weakened." It seems that we have to call more people, I don't have much time!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It looks like this, adults!" The age is almost the same as his magic. The teacher replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four intermediate therapists in pure white robes are on the road . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, Miss Elna." Although the person at the head was very polite, he could not hide the look of contempt in his expression," The order of the law of the adults, you just came back, not suitable for walking around, or take a good rest first. Tomorrow, the law will be for you to participate in the holy water ceremony, please prepare!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where I want to go, wherever I go! You are not qualified to order me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please forgive us, we did not qualify for you!" I grew the word "you" and clearly expressed my irony. "But this is the order of the law of the law, you must obey!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love Erna bit her lip and she stopped talking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You, this friend, we will take him to the room arranged for him, please rest assured!" The man showed a triumphant expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to meet at night!" When Elna walked past Lev, he whispered to the thief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be admitted that the rooms in the temple are very comfortable - from the undead The temple of the Pluto of the island is the same as the temple of the present goddess of life - the room that Lev was sent to can be used to entertain a prince. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leif some unbelievable stepping on the thick embroidered gold silk carpet under his feet, feeling the expensive silk fabric everywhere. He picked up a cup from the table and found it to be silver. This made the thieves spend a lot of effort to restrain the urge to put things in their pockets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was already a good dinner on the table. Everything seems to be perfect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lev is lying on the bed with some fluttering, he has taken off his clothes, because the poor leather armor on his body is really white compared to the white sheets on the bed. It is too uncoordinated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In bed, everything that happened today began to reappear in the mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dike's Northern Expeditionary Army was defeated, and the whole army was annihilated under the attack of the half-orcs and dwarves. The Czech general was also killed! There was another voice in the head of Lev’s mind, but the face would never appear again! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the hell is going on? Didn't the old Locke get the jewel that night? Didn't he say that he could stop the alliance between the dwarves and the half-orcs as long as he got the thing? But the dwarves still form alliances with the half-orcs. Now, the entire human race is under the threat of the two ethnic alliances. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Locke lied to us? no, I can not? Why did he do this? Although the old man revealed so many unexplained secrets, he is not like cheating! Maybe there seems to be another reason behind this thing, but in any case, Deco has lost most of his power, and the whole is exposed to the attack of the Orcs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alna...Lee’s thoughts turned to the therapist. Today, he let him see the other side of this woman. He has never seen the expression of Elna's expression - I have never seen each other for so long. Except for the law, everyone here looked down on her mixed ethnicity and was hostile to her. It is really impossible to imagine how much pressure Erina has to bear in the process of growing up here, how much cold eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time is in the middle of thinking, unconsciously, and at night, I don’t know when I climbed the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leif climbed down from the bed and put on his clothes again. Although not sleeping, after lying for a while, the fatigue seems to have been eliminated. He looked at the door and there was no one at the door. He was free here, and he was not monitored. It was not a problem to go out at night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief looked back at the dinner at the table he had used, which is the only thing worth worrying about. I don't know if the temple will send people to deal with the guests' things at night. If that is the case, they will be found in the room. The thief looked around and he found a way to deal with it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Leif slipped out of the room, he had placed a dummy on the bed. This camouflage made of pillows and other things is so clever, unless someone is looking at it, anyone will mistake him for sleeping in bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leif quickly disappeared into the darkness and touched the residence of Elna that they mentioned in their memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Damn!" After an hour of vain efforts, Lev acknowledged his failure. There is a strict work and rest system in the temple, and now people cannot be seen at all. It is impossible to ask for personal questions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the only light on the road was revealed through a window. Leif thought it was the signal that Elna gave him, but when he touched it, I found out that it was just a group of magicians who performed magical rituals in one room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief was disappointed to bypass a pole. He had already turned around for almost half a night, because there was no one at all along the way, and his alertness was not allowed. Some relax. So he didn't notice the stick that came out from behind the pillar, so he fell to the ground in a logical way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who?" Lev’s reaction was very quick. He turned to the side as soon as he fell, and then quickly propped up his body and used it for a long while. Hand touch the knife on the belt and ask in the mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hand touched an empty space, and Lev forgot that he was completely disarmed when he entered the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Locke figured out the pillar and came to the thief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh! It’s really rare... I’ve met an acquaintance here!" Old Locke looked at Lev with a look of surprise. Like, it seems that he is really unexpectedly met by Lev. He received his cane behind him and seemed to want to hide this tool to smash Lev. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Old Locke... No... Mr. Locke?" Lev screamed. I really didn't think I actually met this weirdo in this place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You...what are you here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This should be by me I have to ask first, don’t you know how to respect the elderly? The question should be asked by me first!” Old Locke seemed angry, interrupting Lev’s words, “How come you are here?”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I came with Elna!" Lev hesitated a little, then thought it would be better to tell the truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I happened to come to the temple for sightseeing. It hasn't come for a long time. It is more scent than before!" Old Locke took a nose and put it out. Smell the smell. "Because I can't stand it, I am planning to leave!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leif looked at the old man, he didn't believe the old Locke, because the old man never did After that, always find a reason for madness, until the end of the truth to reveal a little bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I am lost, it’s really good to meet you, young people!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Is lost? So you didn't return the Luoding gem to the dwarf?" Lev didn't know why he said this. When he spoke, he noticed that the old Locke smiled. The face sank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't get the jewel!" Old Locke said, his voice was completely out of the joke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened..." Lev asked eagerly, but Old Locke interrupted him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't say anything else, now the situation is dangerous, I need your help... Right, Kim? Where does he live?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gold?...he lost with me...now only me and Elna are in the temple."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Locke stunned and then scratched his head. "Oh... this is a bit of a problem." His face expression has returned to the usual state of laughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, there is nothing... originally this temple is still only It’s full of copper smell, everything else is fine, but now there’s a bunch of magicians – it’s getting worse!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The magician?" Lev immediately remembered the daytime. The temple was not allowed to use magic, and the room of the high priest was protected by a magical array. “What is the magician coming here?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What help do you need?" Lev asked again. He once thought that Old Locke had the suspicion of using them to achieve ulterior motives, but after this brief contact, this suspicion has been greatly reduced, but it still exists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I need someone to help me see what the magicians are doing!" Old Locke stared at Lev, "so I hope to make a gown wearing a gown." The people are going to do this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that you can't find it!" Lev glanced at the mage robe on the old Locke, which was full of irony. the taste of. "And it’s not a strange thing for a group of magicians to come to the temple. There is a batch in the front hall!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not the group of wounded!" Locke’s face was re-opened, and it seemed that Lev’s words angered him. "They were injured in the battle with the Orcs. Even with the help of the therapist, it takes some days to recover those complex and serious injuries. The magicians are all the court mages of the Reiter Empire, and there are many. The Imperial Empire has to send almost all his magicians here! And I want to know the reason!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lev looks at the opposite The face of the mysterious old man, when he mentioned the wounded, the old Locke’s look was very angry, and it was the kind of hysterical anger that was incompetent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Locke was silent, and his tone returned to calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know what the magicians are doing! They are building a magical array," Lev said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Magic Array?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I just saw it by chance!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Locke sank a bit, it seems that some can't figure it out, but it immediately returned to normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah...thank you for your luck... just like this, I have to say goodbye!" After he finished, he turned and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait a minute..." Lev called, and Old Locke turned around. "I mean... where do you live?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, rest assured." Old Locke’s taste is very evil. "I have lived so many years, experience. Let me know where the most comfortable place to live!" He said, he walked out of Lev's field of vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An old man who looks like a manager welcomes this with a smile on his face Four guests. At the same time as the brief greetings, the temple convened a group of people, and then quickly transported the luxurious statue to the small venue in front of the temple. An area has been pre-processed here to create a statue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Count of Fatt is really generous... May the goddess protect him and his family forever!" The old man - now knows that he is called Bra Much - eyebrows look at the exquisite statues decorated with various colored stones, and at the same time praise the count of the count. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Big Brother!" The little girl shook Wei's hand hard. "We don't want to watch it here, go to other places to play." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Babe..." Behan didn't speak, Brado had already smiled and picked up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah...I am negligent! Let this work let them do it! Dear guests, let’s go to the temple to see! You are probably the first Come here once! Please feel free to visit!" He said, and he smiled and took the lead and walked into the main entrance of the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four followed and walked in, and the two guards responsible for the guard suddenly called. "Wait a minute, Grandma Brado...you see them...weapons can't be brought in..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man turned and licked the guy who spoke freely At a glance, then I laughed at them and said to them a few. "Everyone, this is the rule of the temple. If your weapons are not very expensive, keep them here for a while. Don't worry, it's safe and won't be lost!" Then he added a softly. "If you don't feel relieved, wait until I let people send your weapons to your room! As long as you don't wear them in the temple, there is no problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, everyone, come with me. Today there is a famous holy water ceremony! Come and visit!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The person is very like Erna!" Jin said softly to his companions. It's really like, just because of the back to them, everyone can't confirm. A group of therapists at the ceremony were all focused, and no one noticed the group of visitors behind them. Although Kim wanted to make a certain decision, he also knew that such an important ceremony could not be disturbed, so he still suppressed the idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, what do you think of the old man? I think he is simply..." Behan asked softly, and the old man is now some distance away from them. Can't hear such soft words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I also feel the same!" Kim replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't think that kind of person can be a therapist!" Wei took a sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter. The teaching of the goddess of life is to respect life and save all living beings that can be saved, but also to admit that it is impossible to forcibly retain the life that is destined to die... So the therapist can arbitrarily extort according to this point... and this is not a violation of the goddess' guidance." The magician whispered. The original intention of the goddess is undoubtedly good, but unfortunately the therapists have taken advantage of the loopholes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No wonder so rich!" Behan looked up at the mural on the ceiling of the lobby. These paintings are all famous, and the temple can put them on the ceiling that does not attract people's attention. It is true that he did not make a mistake in this sentence. No one on the mainland has dared to say that his wealth can be compared with the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's go!" The ceremony looks boring and seems to never end. The female therapist couldn't be Elna, because everyone noticed that she wore a white robes in Phnom Penh, a sign of a senior therapist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Everyone is tired!" After leaving the lobby where the holy water ceremony was held, Brado smiled and said to them. "It’s not easy to travel so long... The room has been arranged, go to rest first... dinner will be delivered to the room!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We can't at night Go out to play?" Babe asked loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, little sister. Just the temple is too big, easy to get lost." The old man still looked at Babe with a smile, and bent down. "If you must go out to play, remember to go out with the adults."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Babe is already an adult!" Little girl shouted loudly, she was pregnant The baby inside also gave a sound that was not loud to support her opinion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Haha... Your sister is so cute, take her out for the first time. Mr. Behan!" The old man laughed and straightened up. "A very lively girl!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ceremony to make holy water is finally over. Twelve advanced therapists are exposed to fatigue, and even the leading law is no exception. This time, the holy water was used for the coming ceremonies, so the weight of the manufacture was larger than usual and it took longer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"False teacher!" Elna followed the law, while others were more or less deliberately keeping a distance from the young woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What, Elna!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to tell you something... ...my mother..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened to the great priest? Isn’t she now praying to the goddess?" The French replies with some careless answers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She prayed this time... Is there anything wrong with it?" Elna said nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it right? It’s just a little earlier than the premise... It’s her own telling me to take a little earlier... What happened?” The law stopped. Look at Elna. “Is there any rumor?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“No...” Alna bowed her head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A row of people walked out of the lobby and let the primary therapists collect the holy water they made. After going out, twelve people dispersed, and soon, there was only Elna left alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"False teacher! I think my mother was imprisoned!" Elna finally got the courage, although this fact means that he violated the rules. But there is no other way. She didn't know where Leif was arranged, because no one would tell her, now she can only rely on herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The law was set aside and turned to look at Elna. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to secretly go to see my mother, but I find that she has a magical array on her door..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is impossible!" The law looked at Elna, who was afraid to look at him because of panic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's true..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The law is silent. "Let's wait, I will summon other auxiliary sacrifices immediately!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I believe there is no lie, but if it is not true..." Before, Elna heard this very deep words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About an hour later, the six auxiliary sacrifices are also the actual responsible persons of the temple, all led by the law to Erna, they Start immediately to the inner hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alna looked at the door in panic, the door was intact It is exactly the same as when she secretly came, that is, the magic array made by the above-mentioned magic crystal is missing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is going on?" The six most prominent people in the temple are gloomy. Look at this obvious lie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No...I did see it!" Elna stepped back and turned to knock on the door. But one hand grabbed her hand and pulled her away from the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a minute, let me see my mother..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You still want to hinder big Prayer of the priest?" The law clung to Elna and prevented her from breaking free. "You should know what you did, this kind of lie, even if you are a high priest's adopted daughter... Elna, now I declare that you have to be confined for half a year, and admit your mistakes to the goddess!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Old Locke walked into the room on the third morning, Lev Not surprising. After such a day, he already had some understanding of this temple. He is only seen as an ordinary guest here and has not received any special treatment. In the temple is completely free, as long as you do not carry any sharp weapons, you can walk freely, without any restrictions - of course, special places do not allow outsiders to enter - the same day and night, but not allowed to ignite at night. This is mainly because they are invited to the interior of the temple, and they are all guests with their own origins. Like Lev, this is an exception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last night, he was careful to hide in Tibet at the beginning, so as not to be discovered, it is really meaningless to think of it now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Tell you a good news!" Old Locke said with a smile, "The therapist was confined!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Alna?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, the crime is not known, but it will be closed for half a year - this is very serious in the temple. Punished."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leif jumped up and fell asleep, and last night he went to find Elna again - because there was basically no one in the room during the day, and this The temple is also too big - so it is very late to sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think this has something to do with the group of magicians in the temple," said Old Locke. "If you want to see her, this is the last chance!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp It is really a beauty. Sleeping in a comfortable room for one night, all the fatigue was wiped out. The magician opened the door with infinite satisfaction and looked out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kim went out and stretched out, then he saw one, no, two familiar figures coming out of the opposite room door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leif!" Kim couldn't help but scream. No, this is impossible. How can Lev be here? I would have planned to go to the market today to find out. According to the old man, most of the primary therapists are at the market, providing medical care to those patients or the injured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gold!" Lev was also shocked by the sound, but immediately discovered the source of the sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Old...Mr. Locke?" The magician looked more surprised at the man who came out of Lev. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The six people walked on a slope, the big one taken by the old Locke The glare from the gems, they can see this huge cave, not seeing it really can not imagine, then the tall and magnificent temple is actually built on the hollow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s the old Locke who brought them here. The old man seems to know everything. He just opened a marble floor and revealed the road leading to this huge underground space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is such a huge void under the temple?" Kim was a little scared to say, think about it, if someone uses magic to destroy this fragile balance, then the whole temple It will collapse immediately and all will be destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the ancient temple of the goddess of life!" Old Locke calmly replied, and after seeing it all around, he took up the jewel. "The new temple is built on the ruins of the old shrine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some light vines growing nearby, and the light they emit makes it possible to see that it is not near nature. thing. The debris of the building full of moss is everywhere, telling how the glory of the past was destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where does it lead to the confinement of Elna?" Lev asked with some anxiety. After all, it is incredible to imprison a person to the ancient ruins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes!" Old Locke replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you know?" Behan asked casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because I am looking at the establishment and development of this new temple!" Old Locke replied. If someone would have asked this sentence, then the tone of the old Locke would make him dismiss the idea. The old man changed his attitude to the past, became serious and serious, or looked serious and serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others silently followed him and stopped talking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are not armed. If there is a conflict, they only have gold magic and baby babe, or add the strange stuff of old Locke. Although it was proposed to take the weapon that had been placed in their room at the beginning, it was rejected. Because this kind of action is easy to anger the goddess and bring disaster to mankind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go here!" Old Locke turned a corner and they began to move along a passage - or once a passage - and quickly walked away Go up the slope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire underground travel process was less than half an hour, and the old Locke opened a stone on top of the head and they returned to the ground of the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where is this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The place where the aunts live!" Six people have already come up. The surroundings are very bright, because the wall is covered with a layer of luminescent material that does not know what it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Follow me!" Old Locke waved his hand and everyone followed him. "I think we still have time!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a fierce voice coming from the front Even though it is still clear across the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This needless to say!" The cold and cold answer. "We want to make a magical array that can open the door at the deepest part of the temple. You can just do what I said!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I can't No doubt!" Brett stood up, slowly squatting, looking relaxed and calm. "You are now asking us to sketch your magical array in that big room. Don't say where you know the magical array - even if I don't understand it - but where is the door you said? Magic You also know the scope of the array, there is no door, unless the so-called 'door' is just a virtual finger, referring to the space crack. But I can be sure that your magic array is definitely not a crack in the space. This makes me have to Some doubts, after all, I am still somewhat confident about magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We don't have time to argue," the law still keeps his appearance. "The time is running out, if it is not finished before the ceremony, I will be finished! Once the high priest does not attend, anyone will immediately know that things are not right, absolutely can not hide!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"I know, but what are you afraid of? You will only be expelled from the temple at most. It depends on your strength, any place is to welcome a senior therapist... and we are different, emperor In a rage, we will cut off our heads!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is the difference? I have been on it all my life..." The law suddenly stood up His words began to get excited. "The fame, status, wealth that have accumulated over the years has all been on it. Do you think I have a retreat?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Hahahaha..." Brett laughed, and his face changed. "There are no other people here, don't be boring and disguise! How can the emperor send you something, how can you feel that you have used to know wealth and treasures? You are the first auxiliary sacrifice, and this temple is simply The world's largest treasure trove, you can get anything... that thing can convince you to betray the high priest... Who can believe it? It is a sage!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The last sentence produced amazing results, and broke the defensive line of the law. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You...you...how do you know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just guessing!" Come see that he has already gained the upper hand and revealed a smile of victory. "Don't be afraid, in fact, I am also like you, being sent by him... I am just curious to know, what method does the sage use to convince you? Convince you to risk the big priest by taking such a big risk, and Joe borrows The command of the high priest fully supports the Reiter empire. Now even steal the legendary artifacts to bring the emperor’s son back to life... Of course, it is impossible to be a status. Your sex determines that the first auxiliary sacrifice is your highest position. The high priest can only be held by women!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you want it too?" The law suddenly showed a terrible smile. "Unfortunately you don't need it! Even though that magic The array can be shared by many people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? So, do you admit that the magic array is not used to open the door that does not exist?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Do I have to say this?" The face of Fashua changed again, and he sat down again and released his fist that had already been clenched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don’t be afraid, actually I’ve completed that magical array this morning! It’s really hard to lose so much magic, but I’m done. I just want to know if you really want to resurrect the emperor... Don't be afraid, my allegiance to Victor's loyalty is not as much as you think. I just want to know what you plan to do, so I don't have to be in a hurry." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The law stared at the other person’s face, and after a period of silence, began to laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Resurrection? Hehehehe... How is it possible? The guardian’s robe can only be obtained by the high priest, and the guardian of the goddess can be cracked without any magic... and The prince's wound was burned by the heat, and it is impossible to resurrect! Maybe Elna can, but she will never be willing to do it? I didn't think of taking the guardian's robe at first, I just want to use it. The power of the magician completes the magical array!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Alna?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She It is the adopted daughter of the high priest and the person who is cared for by the goddess! At the age of eight, she is qualified as a therapist. At the age of ten, she became a senior therapist. At the age of twelve, she was able to perform resurrection. She is like a genius in genius. "When I said this, the law was a bit gnashing." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
