			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 01<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The six people now face eight dragons, and these dragons do not appear after Initiating an indiscriminate attack, they are all looking at the humans at their feet, and they talk to each other with some kind of cipher that humans can't hear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened?" A red dragon spoke. Among all the dragons that appeared, he was the oldest and the oldest (age) maximum). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They kidnapped a poor drake!" Black Dragon was angry at the moment, especially in his imagination, these people are planning to use this poor Xiaolong threatened him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A red dragon!" The red dragon saw the baby hiding behind Bebe, compared to the young black dragon, the red dragon The experience is much richer. After all, he has also been a father himself. He can see that the baby is not in the state of being kidnapped. On the contrary, it seems that the baby is cuddling with these human beings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surrounding dragons confirmed their eyes, and the ones in front of them were indeed a young dragon, and the young ones of them began to attack. Gesture, but the red dragon stopped them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm pretty sure that in the last 50 years, no new dragon eggs have been born, and this little pity is only four months old! This must What is the reason! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence makes all the dragons calm down, the red dragon's sentence is not wrong, indeed there should be no young The dragon appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This must be a dragon egg that we lost before, the despicable thief kidnapped the egg!" Black Dragon made a rebuttal, his words made the Red Dragon impossible deny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In any case, they are indeed with a baby dragon, we must take our family together!" A green dragon proposal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Bring these people back, let the elders dispose of!" Red Dragon made the final decision, this command got the default of all the dragons, they formed a Encircle the circle and surround these human beings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What should I do?" Lev looked at the dragon slowly gathered around his eyes and said to the magician around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know!" Kim is actually quite scared. He has reason to be afraid. In front of him is the most powerful and mysterious creature on the entire continent. . The magicians know that in the Undead War, more than 700 dragons face about 2,000 undead wizards, and the last six dragons die, while the Necromancers are destroyed by destruction, including more than two hundred zombie wizards. All of the more than 1,700 undead wizards were defeated by the powerful power of the dragons. There is nothing left. "But we can't wait here for them!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "We must break through!" said Elna on the side, who can see that these dragons are not good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adventurers chose the weakest breakthrough, the smallest green dragon, the only one that looks better, although he has at least Twenty meters long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold took the lead and rushed to the green dragon. He gave a black mist and tried to block the green dragon’s sight. The Golden Sorcer had no intention of defeating these giants. His purpose was to escape to the jungle in front. As long as he entered there, there was not much chance that a huge dragon would want to catch them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Green Dragon made a roar, although he could only use the opening to open the human in front of him, but he can’t use his spit now, in fact, he You can't use any powerful aggression, otherwise your baby will be unable to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stay, otherwise don't blame us!" The red dragon behind the adventurer issued a warning, but no one cares about this warning at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The green dragon in front of him hesitated. He was too young and inexperienced. He didn’t know what he should do at this time. The black fog covered part of him. Sight, any of his attacks may fall to the younger family. However, when the adventurers approached, he used the paralysis to launch an attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The green longan looked at the human beings running in front of his eyes, but he did not transfer the target of the spell. He waited for his own spells to take effect. When he finally realized that if he continued to do so, the humans would escape. Has passed through his block and quickly approached the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Quick!" The distance between Kim and the forest is less than 100 meters. No one pulls down, Elna hugs Babe, and the baby Flapping their wings and following them. The green dragon was angry and chasing, but it seems that he can't catch up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red dragon flew fast over the top of the green dragon, and the adventurer fell to the front of them less than 30 meters from the forest, and spewed out The fiery flames were in front of them, dispelling the dreams that humans wanted to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone was forced to stop in front of the flames, the other dragons flew up at this time, and fell around them, eight heads in a circle Human. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Human! Don't want to resist, let go of the weapon!" The Red Dragon said loudly in the lingua franca, his voice shook the valley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What should I do?" Behan asked the former magician. At this critical time, everyone began to unknowingly rely on gold. "I don't think they are going to kill us, otherwise the flames will not be sprayed in front of us!" Kim said as he looked at the melted stone in front and re-solidified. Kim knows that spitting is the most horrible and most commonly used weapon of the dragon, but these dragons are not attacked by squirting, indicating that the dragon's intention is not to kill them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing?" Kim answered the dragon in front of him. "We have not offended you! Why attack us?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want you to go with us and explain to our elders the dragon eggs that were stolen from there!" The red dragon replied. He began to think that these humans in front of him were not simple. They could immediately see the weakest link surrounded by them, and almost slipped away successfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dragon Egg?" Kim feels a bit inexplicable "I think you must have made a mistake, I swear, there is absolutely no dragon egg around me, absolutely not! I also Never seen a dragon egg!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No? Where did you get the baby?" The red dragon was a little angry, and his nose started inside. Squirting smoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Young dragon?" Kim looked around, he really did not know that there was a dragon in their side. But when he saw the baby, he suddenly thought of one thing. Why did he feel familiar when he saw the black dragon's sleeping position, because the black dragon sleeps in the same way as the baby? In an instant, all the things have an answer. Why did the black dragon suddenly attack, why are so many dragons appearing together here, why they didn’t use the squirt attack, because the one around them was mistaken for magic The biological baby is a dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God, why is there such a thing in the world, although he thinks that the baby’s growth rate is really amazing, but he did not think that the baby is A dragon. Who would have thought of it? The egg that is tens of meters long and weighs dozens of tons of dragons is only so big! What is the appearance of the newly hatched baby dragon? Kim suddenly remembered that Old Locke had told him that his baby was a dragon, but he couldn't believe it at the time. In fact, he still couldn't believe it until now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold approached the baby, hugged the baby, hesitantly said to the red dragon: "This...this is a young dragon?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon group saw this human movement, and it began to stir up. In their eyes, the baby was determined to be a "dragon". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!" Seeing this human expression, the red dragon couldn’t help but wonder. "Don't you know?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Great!" Lev stepped forward and took the baby from Kim's hand and raised it high. "We hate this... No, This baby dragon is still for you, is everyone talking with the temperament?" The guy who hated him was sent away completely, and Lev was really eager. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the baby didn’t appreciate it, he grabbed it in Lev’s hand with his own paw and returned to Babe’s arms in the voice of Lev’s cry. In the mean, the poor little guy was shocked and shivered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing wrong! Unless my eyes are paralyzed!" Black Dragon's answer is very positive. He began to feel that this group of people should not be the kidnappers he just identified. However, human beings are very treacherous things, and they may be acting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That... will you take care of him?" Babe’s eyes began to show tears in his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You first put down your arms and go with us!" The green dragon violently interrupted Babe’s words, and his performance just made him feel lost. So now I am not in a good mood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Explain to our elders the origins of the baby!" The tone of the dragon began to ease. He began to determine the general situation initially. However, just as humans don't know much about the dragon, the dragon does not know much about human beings. The red dragon does not completely believe these human beings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adventurers looked at each other, what else can they do? Since it is impossible to escape (it is even more impossible to win), it is only a glimpse of them. They all put away their weapons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red Dragon is very careful to hold the baby, although the baby is not willing to leave Bebe's side, but the smell of the red dragon makes him feel very familiar He clearly knows that this creature is not malicious. This kind of familiar and familiar feeling makes him not resist any. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every adventurer has a dragon's back, the dragon begins to flap the wings, they are leaving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 02<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon’s takeoff process is very light, and their huge and bulky body Very incompatible, the dragons completed the process of reaching the sky from the ground with only a gentle flapping of their wings. After a short period of time, the dragons and their humans on their backs began their journey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold sits on the back of the Black Dragon, his position is very good, just in the two largest scales on the shoulder of the dragon, don’t worry that he will fall Going down, you can block the wind, and you can clearly see the scenery below. Although gold often uses flying magic, all the spells in the flying series can't make him fly so high, so the scenery on the dragon's back is still very novel for him. Kim noticed that there was a halo on the dragon during the flight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey! Black Dragon..." But Black Dragon turned his head very unhappy and interrupted Kim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My name is called Glimpse, don't call me Black Dragon, I like this name very much!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "That's okay! Glimpse! I want to ask you one thing!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Say it!" The dragon turned back and looked at the front, in these After the man handed over the baby dragon, his hostility has been greatly reduced. This action proves that these people may really know nothing as they say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the halo on your body?" Jin asked, now he can clearly see that the halo is already quite weak, good The elephant is about to disappear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Magic! Magic against gravity!" Long replied, this is incredible for humans. For the dragon, it seems to be the same as eating breakfast. Easy, "Now you can start to use the updraft, so you can weaken the magic!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Magic against gravity?" Gold muttered to himself, this magic is One of the goals of his teacher's many years of research, but until now there have been no signs of success. When I thought of the teacher, Kim suddenly remembered the old Locke. He wanted to talk to the teacher about the mysterious old Locke, but why did he suddenly forget it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a minute!" Kim said loudly, because they are flying now, so if they don’t speak loudly, they can’t hear. "I just saw that you will use it." Move in an instant, why not move to the Dragon Island without moving instantly?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Dragon turned his head again, his eyes were full of doubts, probably this stupid The problem is that he heard it for the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know how much power you need to move in an instant? Just now they made an instant move. After I went back, I thought they had to eat another meal soon! Flight didn't know How easy is it... ah, yes, you probably haven't encountered this kind of situation! The space law of this world is very troublesome, the volume is certain, the power of space connection is increasing rapidly and irregularly... forget it, You don't understand these things. In short, flying is much easier than moving in space, and it saves a lot of effort!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red dragon flew in the front, and the baby in his front paws carefully held the baby. The baby looked very quiet. It seemed to be asleep. The red dragon surrounded the baby with an orange-red defensive circle and prevented him from being subjected to it. The influence of the wind. Not everyone can enjoy flying at high speed in the atmosphere like gold (after all, flying magic gives him a similar experience), at this moment, Lev on a blue dragon back has begun to feel dizzy, his heart Just want to vomit. But thinking about the consequences of spitting on the back of the dragon, he only has to endure hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it uncomfortable?" A voice reached the thief's ear, and Lev looked up and looked around, only to find that the Blue Dragon was speaking to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No..." But if he didn't say it, he would have to hold his mouth with his hand to prevent vomiting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blue Dragon stared at the human on his back for a few seconds, and an irresistible drowsiness surrounded Lev, the feeling of wanting to sleep overwhelmed others. Everything, even the sense of dizziness, was conquered by drowsiness. Within ten seconds, Lev went to the dragon's back and fell into the deepest dream of his birth. After the human body fell asleep, the Blue Dragon raised his head slightly so that the neck could just block the wind on his back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speed of the dragon is almost unimaginable. After about two hours, the dragon group has already flown through the vastness (a one-and-a-half-month ride by boat) In the ocean, the sky has blurred images of the island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speed of the dragon group slowed down, they began to lower the height of the flight, and the magician on the back of the glimpse saw several dragons on the sea. He knew that the front must be the Dragon Island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragons are fishing. After the flight, the adventurers saw this spectacular fishing scene: the four dragons were divided into four corners, and they used magic to “shoulder” a large piece of water into the air, and then let the sea flow slowly. Just one time they hunt them, they caught at least ten tons of fish. Thousands of silver scales jumped on the air cushion formed by magic and then fell into the dragon's mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon group put the speed to the slowest, the fishing dragons also noticed them, a white dragon flew over, friendly flying to the front Red dragons say hello. But their language adventurers simply can't hear (not to mention understand). But they can roughly infer what they said - because almost all the dragons stopped fishing and flew over to see the baby in the red dragon's paw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon group continues to move forward and flies over the island. Many hear the news (I don’t know how the dragon spreads the news, too fast) Looking at this young red dragon, this makes the progress a lot slower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s really big!" Kim looked at the desolate island full of rocks with amazement, almost no soil, no green, It is a land that humans cannot use. Perhaps because of this, humans have given this vast island to the dragons. However, the strange scenery here still attracts the attention of the first coming human beings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the dragons landed in an open place, and the adventurers climbed down the dragon's back. At this time, the blue dragon has already been lifted. The power of the husband, the thief has woke up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's wait!" Red Dragon said to the six humans on the ground, "I will go see the elders first and see if he would like to meet you!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't want to see us? What do you take us here?" Of course, Lev did not let this sentence leave his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red dragon left, but the other dragons stayed with humans. This place is obviously a place for dragon gatherings. Before these humans arrived, there were already a few dragons gathered here. A huge red dragon disk is on a high ground, and there are many dragons under the high ground - much like the dragon is giving a speech, and in fact it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon is talking with the voice that humans can't hear. Obviously, the dragons below are very fascinating, and almost no one pays attention to these new ones. The coming humans, the black dragon glimpse with Kim also joined the pile of dragons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold walked over with doubts, and the other dragons did not stop his activities - there was no need to stop it, came to the glimpse of the glimpse Look up like other dragons and look at the red dragon, but he has noticed the human magician around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...not reflective, the things that look beautiful are valuable jewels. Be aware that there are so many cheap things that look beautiful, such as glass. Glass is also a glowing thing, but it is not worth it..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who is that?" Kim suddenly felt that the red dragon was talking much like the merchants, and the most treacherous businessmen, he did not consciously open his mouth. Ask the black dragon around you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His name is Fire! And, it is the idol I admire!" replied, he didn't even blink his eyelids. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of flapping the wings interrupted the red dragon’s speech. A very large blue dragon descended from the sky, and the dragons below evaded and vacated the blue dragon. A piece of location. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don’t post those boring speeches! I see you and humans staying for a long time, forgetting that they are a dragon!" Blue Dragon In roaring, "I don't allow you to mislead these young dragons like this!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I certainly didn't forget that I was a dragon!" "However, you have not forgotten that you are an old stubborn! I teach you how to learn how to do business. What is wrong? This is why I can eat the carefully cooked calf kidney meat every day and you are stubborn and eat the most. The smelly fish! You are too old-fashioned! The palace I live in is definitely much better than the cave where you live, and the treasures that are piled up inside are even more difficult for you to think about!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Globe! We collect treasure just to make our caves more beautiful! Just beautiful, what is the value!" Blue Dragon said loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So the smell of fish on your old stubborn body will never go away!" The fire answered with the same high voice. "There is no difference between your head and the stone." I don’t know that I can get a better life with a little change! We have such a powerful force, why should we always eat fish? It’s because you are so stubborn too much!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two dragons bickered each other, and the magician on the side asked the black dragon around him. "What is the identity of the fire? He seems very unusual!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;第03节#br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You haven't heard of him? Right, maybe the name of the fire you really don't know, but you should know the dragon Lead! The fire is the lord! He has another name, what is it... I forgot!" Black Dragon replied as he watched his idol and the blue dragon clamored. (In the Dragons, fighting each other is not allowed. Only in the case of a spouse, the two dragons will engage in a ritualized battle.)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dragon City Lord Nellie!" Kim immediately understood the true identity of this dragon. This dragon is the leader of the Dragon Lord, Nie, the famous dragon city master, who holds the big merchants who lost the continent’s human weapons and armor production. The dozens of titles given and the wealth that is said to be able to pile up in the sky, become the unique alien ruler who ruled hundreds of thousands of human beings as a dragon! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two dragons’ quarrels have already entered the heat, and the blue dragons are scaring their own huge wings, but the fire also begins to spray white smoke from the nostrils. Just when Jindu thought that the two dragons would have a big battle, the conflict suddenly ended incredibly. The two dragons suddenly stopped all acts of hostility, and Kim noticed that the eyes of the two dragons were straight and opposite, and they all fell into a state similar to the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are they doing?" But this sentence has not yet come out, the red dragon that originally sent the letter flew back, he did not land, just in the sky Loudly called: "Elders with your opinion, come over!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Six people stand at the entrance of a huge cave. There are many rock caves on this island. It is naturally used as a place to live by the dragon, and this cave is located in the center of the cave group where the dragons gather. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about the baby?" Asked Beibei on the side, he noticed that the red dragon at the moment did not hold the baby as he left. But Red Dragon did not answer her question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The elders let you go in two and explain to him the time and place of the dragon egg!" The red dragon squatted on the ground so that his face and this Several humans are close together. Although it is not very obvious, Wei can see that there has been some change in the attitude of this red dragon. It is not a friendly change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course, the person who found the dragon egg went in!" Red Dragon replied, he stared at Babe with his eyes, although he knew that these dragons would not (and hardly say) hurt them, but Babe was afraid to hide behind Elna. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am going with you!" Wei walked over to Babe and put a hand on Babe's shoulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will go too!" Kim also came over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You didn't hear it clearly? The elders only need two to go in!" The red dragon on one side said loudly, the sound sounded like this near distance. It is thunder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five adults exchanged their eyes with each other. They knew that something must have happened. They couldn’t let Babe go in. Who knows what the dragon elder is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am going!" "I am going too!" Jin and Wei said to the Red Dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The elder said that people who want to find the dragon egg go in!" Red Dragon said again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We found the dragon egg together!" Behan answered the red dragon loudly. It turned out that when he came to the Dragon Island, he found nothing wrong. On the contrary, he was relieved to confirm that the dragon was a reasonable race. However, he did not know what happened now, and the dragon suddenly changed his attitude. The sense of crisis is once again filled with the hearts of the swordsman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Red Dragon is no longer talking. He has moved his huge body so that humans can easily walk into the cave around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people began to walk inside the cave. Kim’s mood was uneasy at the moment. He didn’t know what the red dragon had said with his baby and the elder dragon. However, from the current attitude of the Red Dragon, it’s definitely not what is good for them. I don't know if Red Dragon specifically asked two people to go in. I don't know if there is any conspiracy! But Kim quickly drove this idea out of his own mind. It would be too easy for the dragon to kill them. They only need to fly into the sky, and then use their terrible spit attack. They don’t want to live, they don’t have any It is necessary to disperse their combat power first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei Jinjin advances with a calm pace, and his fearless expression enhances the courage of the magician. Suddenly, the brain wants to open, even if it is the worst case, it is just a death! What is fearful about death? Come out when the adventurer is going to have a sense of death! Thinking of this, the power of Kim was restored. He followed the Wei in three steps and made two steps, and the two men marched side by side to the depths of the cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This cave is not the same as other dragons! Wei made a conclusion. Just now (that is, when Kim went to the speech), he went to see the dragon's cave. Although he didn't go in (the dragon wouldn't allow him to go in), but the dragon's hole didn't have such a turn, the five he had seen. Dragon points can be seen at a glance. Isn't it possible for Jackie Chan to regard the depth and twists and turns of the cave as a sign of identity? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you turn the fifth corner, the cave is finally over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the gold and jewels that are half full of caves, where is the dragon lying on the plate. This is a white dragon. There are many light vines in the cave, so that the outside human can clearly see the whole cave. The elders of the dragons are not tall, although humans believe that the older the dragon, the bigger the body, but this one should be the body of the oldest dragon that has not yet had that fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White scales have been translucent under the light of the light vine, giving off a beautiful and dangerous feeling, the elders of the dragon feel human When he arrived, he removed his tail and looked up and looked at the two humans who came to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This dragon is really beautiful - it is so beautiful, pure white like snowflakes, flawless, and translucent scales, slender and elegant The neck is shining with the black eyes of rational luster. The most important thing is that this dragon has no strong sense of inviolability that other families have. It is full of peace, the kind of old people give to children. A unique sense of kindness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are the ones who discovered the dragon egg!" Long elders spoke. He spoke of human language and the sound was very good. The hoarse voice was full of magnetism. This kind of voice is probably the talent that the bards who are selling art are eager for, and it is extremely attractive. It’s just this sentence, the vigilance and hostility in the hearts of the two people have been dispelled. The attitude of this dragon is so mild, it doesn’t look like it is against them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to know where the dragon egg was found? We only lost three dragon eggs. Plus this, there is still a dragon egg not found, I think, maybe another dragon egg and this dragon egg are also together. Maybe, I want to ask you! And, I want to know, too," Long elders stretched out one of his forelimbs and opened his paws in front of the adventurer. The baby was lying in the center of his paw. His body was all covered by one. The silver-white energy cover is surrounded. "Who is the person who hurts this young dragon with the method of overdraft vitality?!!" This last sentence suddenly added anger, and the degree of strongness made Wei always calm. I am afraid of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the intense anger of the dragon, Kim continued to retreat several steps, even after the sudden impact of this sudden impact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Breaking the baby?" Kim tried to find similar memories in his mind, but he didn't have any impression. Kim doesn't care much about this young dragon. He has limited contact with this little guy. The only thing that has deep memory is the terrible spit of the baby in the half-orc barracks. All along, the people who take care of this young dragon are babe, but Babe has always loved this little guy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We put the handle on the hilt, but immediately removed it. He can judge that although the dragon is angry, but there is no hostility, the dragon has not planned to hurt them. Moreover, if the dragon really wants to attack them, I am afraid they have no chance of luck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long elders stretched their heads forward, letting the two humans in front of them feel his anger more clearly. "You already knew that he was a dragon, right? And you I’ve been using him all the time, you know, because of the damage you caused, the vitality of this poor drake has weakened to less than one-fifth of the original!!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Under the intimidation of the dragon, the two humans began to retreat. The elders of the dragon are using their own magic to influence the two humans, making them feel fearful. There is no way to escape and resist this fear. Personal class is frank and everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We didn't..." After half of it, Wei's voice was interrupted, and the fear rushed like a beast to make his throat Dry, can't make a sound. Wei’s entire body was stiff, and the magician couldn’t support it and sat down on the ground. The dragon that was released by the elders was filled with anger and filled with this space, even if it was a fearless warrior (like Wei). In front of the strength, the body will be stiff and unable to move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despair, helplessness, fear, timidity all come from the deepest part of the mind, all the muscles of the body are tense, so that they can not move, the only way out Just kneel down and confess everything to this dragon. The elder dragon looked at the human being in front of him, and he believed that he would soon know the truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 04<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two humans seem to have no way to withstand this uncontrollable fear The elder dragon converges a little bit of his own strength. He will not harm the two humans until the truth is determined. However, the resistance of these two humans is too strong, even if the spirit collapses, it is not as he expected. He is frank. Maybe they really don't know anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is certain that this baby dragon has suffered a lot of damage, it is strange for the dragon elder to show that this baby dragon does not show his status. The kind of exhaustion and drowsiness that fits, on the contrary, he has always been very spiritual. This is a big difference from common sense. Is this dragon staying in the egg for too long and causing the vitality to drop? But in the memory of the elders of the dragon, this has never happened since I came to this world. However, it is hard to say that the dragons have always been very good at caring for eggs. They are all in time to hatch. There is no precedent for this kind of thing that has dragged on for decades. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, the elder dragon relaxes the pressure, he has enough time to let these two humans slowly yield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people have already sat down on the ground at this moment, Wei’s state is a little better, but there is no good place to go, that kind of fear echoes repeatedly in his heart, Thanks to the extraordinary spirit and the relaxation of the elders of the dragon, he resisted this terrible pressure, but he could not resist it for a long time. The magician around Wei is close to the edge of the collapse. All the fears in the past memory have been called out at this moment, and there is a fierce flight in the mind. However, there is some kind of power to support him and not give in, never give in. I would rather die in fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elder dragon has converged a little more power. He is now amazed by the ability of these two people to endure. No human being can resist this for so long! Are they really innocent? After shrinking the force again, the dragon elder suddenly felt the same existence! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is it! Give me out!" The dragon said in front of his pleasing voice that there is nothing at all in this position, at least it seems nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hehehe...I’m sorry! I came here when you are busy! I apologize for this impolite action!” The sound of the frog inside the box came out in the space that seemed to have nothing. Then, a black shadow with a huge cloak appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Supreme!" The magician gently recited the name of this uninvited guest in his mouth, the unforgettable voice and the draping The body of the black cloak illustrates the identity of the person coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I really shouldn't visit when you torture the prisoner! Don't mind my existence, continue to teach those kneeling humans!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They are not prisoners, and humans are not a squat race!!" The unrelenting answer, the vigilance of the voice is undoubtedly exposed. This mysterious guy is indeed worthy of vigilance, especially if he can come to such a close place without any sound and he has not found it! The dragon can sniff out the dangerous atmosphere from the other's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't say this, in order to express my apology, let me see my meeting!" A corner of the black cloak smashed up, from this In the corner of the pick-up, a large amount of jewels suddenly spouted like a fountain. Although the elders of the dragon are now staying on the heap of treasures, but compared with the things that the sages have made from the cloak, the heap of treasures filled with half a cave is immediately bleak. Every piece is a treasure that can be met, and each piece exudes a dizzying brilliance, and the cloak of the sage seems to be the source of bottomlessness, and new things are constantly piled up, let People doubt whether they will bury their sages themselves! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This fountain that has fallen out of sight has finally stopped, and the sacred person’s base is now almost as high as the dragon in front of him. Although there are not many things at the foot of his dragon, but anyone can know that the value under his feet is much higher than that of the elders of the dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to do?" The look of the dragon elders has not changed, although in other ethnic concepts, the dragon is very fond of jewelry. But at this moment, the elders of the dragon did not seem to see the glittering things in front of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is nothing special, I just want to be an ally with the Dragons!" The two creatures discussed each other and temporarily ignored the existence of two human beings. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Allies! Why do we need allies? Our dragons don't have any special needs, living here is very good, we can get everything we need. We You can protect your own safety, we don't need allies!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hehehe... Specifically, I want to let the dragons join a league!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What alliance?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A coalition against humanity!" Concealing, he immediately spoke the truth, and did not care about the two humans around him, or for him, these two humans are already dead, and he did not even carefully look at the two humans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why do we want to join this alliance? And, what benefits can we get?" Although the expression of Dragon Elder has not changed at all, but from his tone, He seems to be shaking a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just don't want the powerful dragons to succumb to humans. With the power of the dragons, they can become the masters of this continent, instead of hiding in a small island. The days of exploitation by human beings. Don't you think that this kind of life is very incompatible with the dragons? Why do the strong people hide in a corner and let useless humans occupy the fertile land..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For us, the fertile land is meaningless! This island is more suitable for us than the plains! Forget it, let alone these words, simply say, we want What? What, what can we get?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Supreme is silent, he did not expect the dragon to be so convincing, or, this dragon There is no sincerity at all, just want to cover his words. After analyzing several possibilities in the brain, the Sayādaw answered, and his words were very straightforward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very tempting condition, at least in the mind of the Sayādaw, this condition is too persuasive, and should be able to convince the dragon in front of you! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words of the Sayādaw let the magician on one side feel the hair of the whole body erect, although the clothes on his body are still full of sweat. He suddenly realized that his life was already in the answer of this dragon. If the elders of the dragon made a positive answer, they would never be left behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long elders suddenly laughed, the laughter of the dragon was similar to that of humans, but the sound was very loud, and the laughter of the dragon elders echoed throughout the cave. The magician began to gather all his power - for humans, most of the time meant laughing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No power! ? Why is there no power? Kim repeated the prayers repeatedly in his own heart, but the gods did not give any answer, and no power gathered on him. This is different from the situation in the Orcs. At that time, there was no way for the power to play. Now there is no power to respond to his prayer. This space is closed by some kind of power, and no god can hear his prayers. Kim turned to look at his companions around him. Wei was concentrating on the two creatures in front. He had put his hand on the sword in his waist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon finally stopped his laughter, he stood up, the baby was placed next to him - the silver light still surrounded his body. He took a half step forward so that he and the Supreme are closer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I refuse! Our dragons are not militant races! We respect all life! We don't rely on violence to hurt other lives to get things? All The life is sacred and should be completed according to the original trajectory!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hehehe...you can have this view very well, but put this concept Keep dealing with those noble races! Not humans! The low-lying humans don't deserve to be treated like you! You should know that they are the ones who will most violently treat other lives – even their own human beings – in this way! Treating them is the way to cure their own people!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If we do what you say, what is the difference between us and human beings?" What?! Moreover, life has no distinction, only the difference between strong and weak! Since you think that human beings are a mistake, why should we use the same method to stop this mistake? You are just in the name of a big meaning. Separate to realize your own lust Our dragons will never be in alliance with you!!!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hehehe...hahaha...The power of the dragon is really amazing! Crossing my defense line directly reads my heart, although it is only reading the surface consciousness, it is also very great! It seems that I underestimate you, it is a powerful race that can travel through time and space!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Needless to say, give me a roll!" Long elders opened their mouths, and did not sprinkle anything in his mouth, but the stone at the foot of the Sayādaw immediately appeared like a spider web. Crack, the dragon elder is attacking the sage in front of him with some invisible power! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;第05节<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goldingly watching this scene, the dragon elder’s attack is very strange . The sage is now on the treasure pile, and the treasures that he is in direct contact with have not changed, but there are cracks on the ground. It seems that he can directly attack the ground through this thick treasure pile. This attack has no practical meaning, just a threatening nature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of the Savior floated up, and in this place where there is no way to summon the power, he still seems to be unaffected, he rises to a height and let him It is almost the same height as the dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't worry about it! Is there a small number of humans killed by dragons? As far as I know, the number of human beings who died under the dragon is innumerable. Then why should you refuse? The boring fake compassion!!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If a dragon fights and kills an opponent for self-defense or to protect his property That kind of behavior is reasonable. If it is to fight for plunder as you said, it is a shame for us!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Hehe...then forget it! I took back my words, when I did not ask the alliance to ask for it! I only have a small request, since the dragons are not willing to join any war, then act according to your wishes, do not get involved. Anything happens on the lost continent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am referring to this covenant! The holy light dynasty of the man who signed the covenant with you in the past has long since perished. It does not make sense to hold this covenant with death. It is the right thing to give up this covenant! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have no right to end this covenant on behalf of the Holy Light Dynasty!" The dragon replied with a low voice, this voice and his original kind sounded very The sound of glamour is different, it is not like the same throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The end of the covenant is the same! Anyway, the person who comes to you with this covenant will never represent the Holy Light Dynasty. In this case, Then why do you still abide by this covenant?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you mean that we treat the sacred covenant like a piece of paper?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just don't want you to be bound by the things on paper! You have to know that if the agreed party does not exist, then the covenant itself loses its meaning! This is very normal. Phenomenon, all races are doing this..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words of the sage are interrupted because the dragon has launched an attack on him from the mouth of the dragon The invisible force that spit out hit his body and hit the sage to the wall, and the body wrapped in a black cloak pressed the whole into the rock! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give me a roll!!" The dragon stopped the attack, and he knew that this level of attack would not cause fatal damage to the opponent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The stubbornness!" The lord immediately came out of the rock, and he was angry. There was nothing to dare to treat him like this. He put away it. When the lobbying mood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge energy storm violently collided in this cave, flying all the illuminating treasures that were originally concentrated, two forces far beyond humans The creatures outside the scope began a fierce battle, the energy of each other collided with each other, and the entire cave space was filled with the turbulent flow of energy out of control! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two human beings were forced into a small corner by this powerful force. Just at the beginning of the battle, an energy suddenly passed to Kim, and the magician at the moment did not use any prayers. With this miraculous power, the magician opened a protective cover that protected two people from the power of chaos in this dangerous place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scene slowly calmed down, and the jewels that were flying around now fell to the ground, and now two people can see the situation clearly. The sage is standing in front of the dragon, the two creatures face to face (the sage looks up, the dragon looks down), the dragon's mouth is open, and the invisible force is spurting out from the mouth, focusing on the front. The body of this mysterious fellow, and the same, the two of the sages are lifted up (in the same black cloak), the power is constantly being emitted, and the strength of the dragon is against each other. The ugly voice of the Sayādaw is echoing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Great! You can use your power to control the entire space rule! Repel all elves, only the life energy attack of the collection itself is effective! In this case I am afraid there are no creatures that can defeat the dragons! However, in this world, nothing can beat me! You are no exception!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like In response to his words, Kim saw a crack in the dragon's head (face), and the crack quickly became a wound. The huge scales were sprayed together with the red blood, and the dragon made a painful roar, but But it did not move, but strengthened the attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What exactly is this? Kim carefully looked at the protective cover that he had made himself in front of him. Rather than saying that this is something that he himself consciously created, it is better to say that the sudden emergence of power through him. This red mist-like shield isolates the powerful energy from the outside and can cause damage to them, but there is no such magic in all the magic that Kim knows! Also, in the end, the dragon and the sages are using each other to attack each other. The dragon’s words are okay to say that after all, vomiting is his instinctive trick, but what power does the sage use against the dragon? Be aware that there is no way to use any magic in this space! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why didn't he come out, Lev stunned. It’s been a while since two people entered the strange cave, but they still don’t see anyone. He looked at everyone, and everyone’s face was clearly marked with the word "worry". But the attitude of these dragons around them is very leisurely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
