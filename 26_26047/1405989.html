There is everything in the studio as a magician, a variety of herbs, magic books and bookshelves, various magical aids, and many more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s amazing. Since you can create a space to be your own research room, Kim swallows a mouthful of tension and admiration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great Magister sat on a chair with gold that felt stiff in both hands and feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Raymond...Mr. Raymond, how did you do it, put the research room in this place, no, it was this place. Do the research room." Kim’s mouth was unclear and raised his doubts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond smiled and replied, "This is nothing. Any big magician can do this as long as he has enough time."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But my teacher, Xiu Ke, he has never done anything similar."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Young It seems that you are not very familiar with your teacher, although it is amazing for people like you, but in the eyes of the big magister, this is not a big deal. Your teacher probably I just don't like the feeling of being up and down in different spaces. After all, if I am used to being outside, I will not be used to it in such a place."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;金He fixed the god, he picked up a magic book, he had seen this book, but he did not allow him to read books beyond his ability. He subconsciously flipped through a few books, but now even this magic book can't attract his attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, Mr. Raymond," Kim finally found the topic, "What are you doing here?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The study of the curse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The curse??!!" Kim was shocked, the curse was a kind of banned in ancient times. Special magic, the characteristics of this magic is uncontrollable. In general, the magician can use magic to overlap or reduce the magic to control the power of magic, but the curse is not the same, the user can not control the power of the curse, and often the power of the curse is very powerful. In the dynasty war at the end of the Holy Light Dynasty, in order to win, the human magician re-opened the seal of the curse in desperation, precisely because of the use of the curse, the entire brilliant magical civilization was almost destroyed, countless Books and cities were turned into flying smoke in front of the curse, and many of their predecessors' efforts were lost, and the Holy Light Dynasty collapsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, to study the curse only in this place, otherwise it will cause great damage. I don't like the feeling of up and down, if not In order to study the curse, I will not create such a research room."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But" Gold asked cautiously, "Why are you studying the curse?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big magician saw through the mind of Kim. He smiled and replied, "Don’t worry, young people, I am not studying for any special purpose. I am not a good one. The war man, I studied the curse just to find out the true meaning of magic. Otherwise, I have already spread the curse I know. Hahaha..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Gold felt a little red in the laughter of the big magister, he quickly found a few magical topics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold was only able to leave in the afternoon, and Raymond invited him to lunch. He really couldn’t quit. At lunch, Kim saw all of Raymond’s apprentices, including Brett. During the meal, everyone talked about the contest in Delante. In addition to not saying a word, other magicians, including those who were defeated in the contest, praised Wei’s young and powerful. . Kim now knows that their purpose is also the "magic book of the light." When Kim talks about the consequences of his opening the book, everyone is as amazing as he is about the power of the light. The Magi also felt very sorry for not being able to see the magic book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Kim got up and said goodbye, it was not early. When he returned to the hotel, others were waiting for him to come back. Everyone is very happy to play today. Everyone feels sorry for Kim’s failure to play the military field. Apart from Kim, he feels very fulfilled today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone, do you want someone who is very familiar with Dike to be your guide? I know all the places of interest in Deco."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Talk Look, you know where." Lev replied, he did not believe this bad old man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The most worthwhile place for Dick is the Hope City next to the "Semi-orc Wilderness" in the north. There is a great ancient site next to the city. It is the ruins of the Holy Light Dynasty. It is a magical place to let everyone who has been there to be full of praise."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Beside the Hope City Ruins?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, you know the origins of Hope City. When the Lights drove the Orcs out of Dick, they led the army to catch up to the present. Known as the 'semi-orc wilderness', in order to prevent the harassment of the half-orcs, he ordered the construction of six cities to form a line of defense. Among them, Hope City is the largest and the center and the key to the defense. It’s just a military fortress, but it’s already a big city, because it’s in the middle of the Shark Harbor and Kemer’s transportation line, it’s a transit station, so it’s getting more and more prosperous.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lev sent a sly smile "Thank you, Father We will be there to take a look, but we do not need guidance. "Locke saw the face of disappointment, Lev feel very vent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I couldn’t see the old Locke, Behan asked Lev. “Is that old man talking about it? There is a very interesting place on the edge of Hope City. "How have I never heard of it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know, I have not been to Hope City, but it is probably not fake, but it is the way, we Have a good time at Hope in front of Shark Harbor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two days later, after visiting all the scenic spots in the city of snow and ice, six people set foot on The road to Hope City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-orc wilderness in the north of Dike is now the night, the wilderness is cold The wind bursts, and the dust and gravel are flying all over the sky, a desolate scene. A human army is camping on this wilderness. From the towering flags, they are the regular army of the Dico Kingdom. At this time, the camp was very quiet, and all but a few sentinels were already asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this terrible weather, the officers’ vigilance was reduced to a minimum, leaving only the minimum number of sentinels to whistle in the camp. But outside the camp, they set up fences and fences according to the marching habits, and arranged for three soldiers to be guarded outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's so cold!" A soldier outside the camp complained while squatting on his feet. "Why is it our turn to send a few whistle to our brothers? It is this kind of ghost weather."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, boss, why do we still come to this kind of bird? Routine patrols where the eggs are laid? The half-orcs have been quiet for ten years, and they have never appeared at the border. This patrol was used to prevent the attack of half-orcs. What is it for now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stupid, these are the officials who want to invite, so they carry out this meaningless patrol. They have the best tents without fear of cold and sand. We these The lower-level soldiers can fall down on the mold, and they have to go to such a ghost place, and we don’t have any share when we pay for it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, boss, You said why the Orcs have not been active in recent years. I heard that those guys used to attack the Hope City area seven or eight years ago."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" You guys really have no knowledge, it must be the inside of the half-orc, you are killing me, there is no room for you. Harassing us. Since the death of the King of the Tooth in the Liberation War, the Orcs have never united, and the tribes are killing each other. No one is convinced. No one can get the proof of the King of Tooth, the legend. In the 'God of the God of War', I doubt if there is such a thing. Anyway, they are killing each other and it is a good thing, I hope they will never find the hammer of the god of war, so we never have to worry about them." The soldiers who are known as the bosses are really a bit acquainted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, it’s too cold, boss, let’s have a fire to get warm."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Good idea, hello, fat man, you go to the camp to find some firewood, just where you go to find it, if you can't find it, you can also remove the fence. Those who are in the bed are comfortable. Why do we want to blow cold wind here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Boss, I seem to hear something!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't be nervous, now there is something sound, probably the wind blows the stone." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I really heard the sound, it’s not the wind, it’s not the sound of the stone falling on the ground. You listen carefully"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems to be a bit unusual! It seems to be getting bigger!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the dark It is definitely not the sound of the wind, although it is dark, but there is something close. The voice was getting closer and closer, and the boss suddenly understood what it was. It was a half-orc, and the half-orc came to the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horn of the alarm rang in the camp of humans, and the officers and soldiers rushed out of the tent with drowsiness. They still didn’t know what happened, no one thought of it. The Orcs will launch a night attack at this time, and everyone almost thinks that someone is falsely alert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the human race, the half-orcs have already rushed over. They filled the protective ditch with the prepared sandbags, crossed the fence, and desperately rushed. Enter the human camp. Before humans understood it, tens of thousands of orcs had surrounded the army of 5,000 people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Humans have resisted, but both the number and the quality of the Orcs have taken advantage, human beings are in chaos, they are separated by the Orc warriors, completely lost Organization. The half-orcs give full play to the advantage of individual combat strength than humans, and turn the people killed by human soldiers. The human magicians did not have any help. In the midst of chaos, they were cut down by the Orcs without any chance of using magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before dawn, the battle ended, the Orcs cleaned the battlefield and left with a large number of spoils and prisoners. After they left, the sand quickly buried all the traces of war. No one can see that there was a fierce battle here last night, and no human beings escaped from the massacre. They can go back and report. A human patrol unit has lost news since then, but humans do not know what happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 02<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hop City is a very dangerous city, it does not refer to it How the height of the city is thick, depending on the water in the mountains, but it means that its geographical location is dangerous, and it is a battleground for the military. It is both a strong defense against humans and half-orcs, and a springboard for half-orcs to attack humans. In history, half-orcs have captured this dangerous city several times, and then they have swept down the most fertile plains of Dicco. But since the Deco army made a decisive victory for the Orcs three hundred years ago, the city has been within the sphere of human power. Although the Orcs attacked many times, they were all repelled by humans. In recent decades, with the reduction of the Orcs' offensive and the booming of the Shark Harbor, the city has become a transportation transit station for the Deca Capital City and the Shark Harbor, which is booming day by day. Now, six people like Kim are standing in front of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The high wall!" Lev looked up and admired that the city's defense capabilities definitely exceeded the capital of the country. Although this granite wall is not very beautiful, it is undoubtedly very practical. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you arrive, everyone goes to the city to find a hotel, take a good day off today, and go to the site to play tomorrow." Jin took the lead and walked to the gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time is already close to dusk, but the gate is still wide open, there are still many people coming in and out, and the guards of several teams are standing here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hand is in front of the adventurers who want to enter the city, the owner of the hand is a guard, - from the dress, he is the commander here A pretty fat guy - he looked at the adventurers with a kind expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you going to do?" Gold asked the fat face of the guard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guard did not answer, he used his finger to put a yellow paper on the wall next to it, the age of this paper is probably older than everyone present. Be old. Kim looked at it and wrote on the paper<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All citizens of Hope City:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To prevent this from happening Similar to the riots of the previous day, the following bans are now issued: from now on, no one is allowed to carry weapons into the city, and all offenders are detained.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After reading this notice, Leif took a step forward. He pointed to a sword in the distance and wore a sword in the waist. He was buying something at a stall in the city and said, "That, look, why is he? Can you hold a weapon?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat guard didn’t even return, just a sly smile on his face. "I see, you are the first. Come to Hope City next time? Actually, it is very simple to bring weapons into the city. Just give me a few gold coins, I will not see what I have done, let you go in.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are a fake public, too disappointing!" Elna made an angry voice, loud, so that everyone else noticed it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh! I didn't notice that there is a beautiful woman here, little beauty, you are angry and beautiful!" The fat guard sent off Laughter, next to the adventurers, several guards gathered around to make the fat guards more unscrupulous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, okay!" Lev didn't want to cause riots, and he also understood that this kind of thing might be very common in this city, he took out a few Gold coins, "Give you, let us in!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now, no magic crystal coins are given to each brother, I am afraid they will not Promise! Or, let this little beauty play with us." The fat guard's face showed a sinister smile, and the other guards also laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn, don't deceive too much!" Behan couldn't stand it anymore, and he was already planning to give a lesson to those who didn't know what to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about deceiving you?" The fat guards looked at them. They had thirty people, and the adventurers had only six, but also women and children. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We put the hand on the hilt of the demon sword. When I saw this movement, the fat guard shouted: "Brothers, they dare to resist Let's grab them all!" The guards knew that this was a question to play, and the opportunity to get the beauty to get it, they swarmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but they miscalculated their opponents this time. In fact, as long as Elna is alone, it is enough to solve them all, and soon, the fat in front. The guards smashed Erna's heavy hook and the whole man was beaten and flew up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the fat guards finally stand up, those who dare to do it have been solved by the adventurers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Abominable!" The overbearing habits that have been developed over the years have not changed because of this heavy punch. The fat guards are angry and angry. "They dared to attack the guards and fuck the guys." "Everyone!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guards pulled out their weapons and they used weapons to maintain their privileged position. Of course, the adventurers also responded, the sword was unsheathed, and the magic and summoning were immediately prepared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bloody conflict is on the verge, all the onlookers are far away, enjoying the free performance in the distance, the guards do not dare to rush first They also know that these adventurers are not so good at all. Even the fat guards saw the adventurers take out their weapons and put forward to resist. They did not dare to go forward, only screaming behind others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's put down the weapon, or I will order the killing, and surrender!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alna rushed up. As a respected therapist, she has never been insulted. Her face is full of anger. Now it’s time to give these guys a lesson and let them Knowing that a woman is not a good bully, even a therapist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current soldier is wielding a big knife, but Elna’s speed exceeds his reaction speed. In front of the blade and body, Elna is close to him. The body, the fist hits his lower abdomen, although there is no magical energy, but the strength of the fist is enough to make him lose his combat power immediately, and the whole body is softened. Using this unlucky body as a shield, Elna easily kicked off the other guy's chin with a side kick. Now there is no other person between the fat guard and Elna, and Elna rushes to fat. In front of the guard, grabbed the collar of the coward who couldn't help but retreat - this is to prevent him from falling - and then punched his fat face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the fat does have the effect of reducing the impact, then the effect is limited, at least the fat on the face of the fat guard does not reduce the number of fists. Impact, this punch made the fat guards even urinating almost all of the urination, playing out of the mother's womb, he has not tasted this heavy punch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one doubts whether this strange woman has this ability. The shot that has just been punched has already made the best explanation. The guards stopped and looked at each other and didn't know what to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation is deadlocked, no one dares to act rashly, but the fat guard can be fed up with sin, and his collar Le’s can’t breathe, his His face turned green, but Elna didn't mean to let him down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A big drink broke the deadlock "What happened!" With the voice, a regular soldier of a squadron came under the leadership of an officer, the officer Turning over the horse, I came to the center of the storm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The officer is about forty or fifty years old, wearing a well-made armor, not wearing a helmet, every move is exuding the breath of anger and exuberance, his armor In front of it is engraved with the coat of arms symbolizing his family and the flag of the Dicco kingdom. In the Dicco kingdom, only the general is eligible to enjoy this honor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened in the end!" The general went to the crowd. When he saw Elna holding the gatekeeper in his hand, he roughly guessed Out of a rough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sir!" The guards of the guards seemed to have seen the savior, a guard rushed up and reported what happened to the general, of course, omitting all of them. Wrong, and added a lot of crimes to Kim who did not know where to come from, making people feel that he did not go to be a lawyer is really a waste of talent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general turned his head and looked at the adventurers, except for Elna’s unlucky city official, who was holding the weapon, but it was obvious There has been no conflict with the guards. These adventurers don't look like the type of scam. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you admit what he said?" The general asked in a majestic voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before other people answered, Elna gave a chuckle, she let go of the almost smashed gatekeeper, giving him when he kept gasping. He is not a light foot - but it is enough for him to make a pig-like scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Quickly, fat pig, have you asked us for a bribe?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;City gate The official did not speak. He saw that the situation was changing. He thought about how he could escape from this woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Elna’s fist hit all the thoughts in his mind and saw that the culprit was silent, Elna was appropriate Give him a little encouragement - a good fist that is controlled by power. (Leif saw this scene and suddenly thought that if Elna would marry him later, he would immediately become the chairman and secretary of the association.)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I said, I said!" Under the threat of Elna's fist, the fat pig betrayed his companion. He honestly explained everything. From asking for a bribe to deliberately picking up the incident, there is no omission. Just now All the lies of the guards with lawyers' talents were leaked by their chiefs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 03<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general’s face is more and more ugly, the more the face of the guard’s face The more miserable the listener was, after listening to all the words, the general screamed, "Come, come and grab all these scums and let them prepare for the military court. They used the old notice of sixty years ago to extort money!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The regular soldiers quickly executed the command of the chief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general took a step forward and he felt it was necessary for these adventurers to get rid of the bad impression of Hope City, so they made a military-like Apologize, "Sorry, everyone, I am the garrison commander of the city, Czech Hoffman. I apologize to you for the scum. Although the Guard is not my direct subordinate, I have to do this. I have a certain responsibility. In order to express my sincerity, I think, can you please take a meal with you, I hope you will not refuse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See these first The black sheep were arrested, and then the garrison commander apologized to himself. The anger of everyone was gone. Kim also returned a gift to him. "General, thank you very much for your love..." He wanted to reject this kindness. The invitation, but Lev interrupted the words of gold, "we will respect you as if you are respectful." Jin looked back at others, everyone was very fond of the Czech generals, they all showed approval. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the speech, everyone began to have some understanding of the status quo of the city. Hope's army consists of two parts, the regular army and the garrison. The former is commanded by the garrison commander, who is responsible for the city of Hope, a big businessman who climbed up on political donations. Originally, Hope City was not too defensive, but after Hope City became the transit point for the trading line between Shark Harbor and the Ice City, it was considered that the military might not be good at managing economic activities, so King Deco ordered the appointment of the Guardian in Hope City. This was a great thing, but everyone saw that it was a fat man. As a result, they sharpened their heads and drilled at this position. Finally, the "profiter Roma" - who had done business with him Call him - sit in this position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rome was in the name of "convenient to maintain law and order", and formed a unit called the Guard. It’s a mixture of fish and dragons, sand and stone, and everything, even the Czechs did not think that this unit has been corrupted to this point. Moreover, in order to consolidate his position, Roma tried every means to make his son Rom the deputy commander of the regular army of Hope City. As soon as the Czech Republic arrived, he retired and the entire Hope City was his world. But the Czech Republic, who is the first military commander of Dike, can't take him anymore. Little Roma is indeed a good commander. Apart from being young and angry, he is a little too anxious. There is nothing wrong with picking it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general’s home is not very far away, right next to the military camp, and not a very luxurious house, at least with his identity - the Dico Kingdom A general, the general commander of the Northern Defense Line and the Commander-in-Chief of the Hope City garrison - did not match very well, and the six adventurers were warmly welcomed here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, Lord General, if you want to go to the ancient ruins next to Hope City, how much time does it take?" Han raised a question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ancient ruins? What ancient ruins?" The Czech face was puzzled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The ruins of the era of the Holy Light Dynasty!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The ruins of the Holy Light Dynasty? There is no such thing around Hope City!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really? There are no ruins nearby? General, although I should not doubt, but you really Can you be sure?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I am a Hope, and I spent 40 years in my life for fifty years. Everything in this city is well known, there is no ruins at all! If there are any ruins, it is also the site of the ancient battlefield!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone They exchanged their eyes and they designed the bad old man again. To be honest, after listening to the description of Old Locke, they have great expectations for this ancient site. Now it is found to be a scam, and everyone has different degrees of disappointment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After dinner, everyone went to the Czech generals and embarked on the road to the hotel - the Czech general recommended them. It is said that the price is cheap and the service is excellent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How do you think the Czech general is this?" Behan asked Kim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a good person, a rare good person! It’s majestic and friendly. If you know him, you won’t have a glimpse of Hope. If there is a chance, I I will do my best to help him." Kim still doesn't know that what he said casually will become a reality in the near future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, do you know? Don’t look at the Czech Republic so kindly, in fact he is very strong, he is a paladin, and Wei is a level!" Lev was excited to say that he had just had some wine at dinner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes? Really, I can't see it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People walk As I said, I quickly arrived at the entrance of the hotel. When they stepped up the steps, there was a person who was pushed out by the person and hit Kim (he walked in the first one). The impact was great. Lian Jin also stood unsteadily. He stepped back a few steps and hit the people behind him. In addition to walking in the last Wei and Beibei (she sat on Wei's right shoulder), everyone fell on the steps. Fell into a ball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It hurts!" The blonde went out, his head hit the steps, and although he didn't break his head, it was already so painful. Behan was even worse. He was pressed down by the heavy body of gold and became the cushion for the bottom. Only Lev is an exception, because he is just entangled with Elna, the head just touched Elna's chest, the soft feeling is really good, he almost did not want to stand up. But he was not happy for a long time, and Elna's elbow in a casual (???) made him change from pleasure to pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'm sorry, sorry! But it's not my fault, they brought me out. Hey, old, people look down..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kim felt that the voice was very familiar. He looked at the past through the bright moonlight. As expected, he was the big liar and the old drunk Locke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone stood up, and Old Locke recognized the Golden Group. "I’m so lucky, we met here again! It seems that we still have a fate! Young people, you look good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leif’s dislike of this old man is more than anyone else, he immediately took over the topic “Your color It’s also very good! It’s not a thing to throw it out! I really don’t understand how you came here. It seems that people here don’t have much affection for the old man who cheated and ate! You are in the wrong place. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Locke did not pay attention to this sharp words, and he put on a poor look. "The people here don't have any sympathy for the old man. Originally, I am sure to sleep on the street tonight, but I have met you! I believe that a compassionate young man like you will never let my poor old man spend the night on the cold street, right?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I was eaten and drunk by old Locke last time Meal, but to be honest, it is also gold bear to see a thin old man dressed in such a cold night sleeping on the streets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Grandpa" opened on the side of Beibei. "What did you say last time about the ancient ruins near Hope City? Why do people here say that there is no such site? You are not going to lie to us?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone immediately remembers that there is such a thing, they all look Old Locke, waiting for his answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there such a thing? Why don't I remember? (Leif almost wants to kill this old man) Maybe there is it! Right, I think It’s got up, there is such a ruin, very beautiful place, not far from the city, only a half-day walk, but you said that no one knows that this site is impossible! Probably the people in this city are not willing to let Strangers go there!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This old man said a lie just like real!" Lev thought so, the Czech general had no reason to deceive them. of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Father, can you take us there to see?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course, of course Since you generously invited me to live in a hotel, I will definitely take you there to see it! How about tomorrow?" Old Locke said that he would not lie in the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although everyone doesn’t like this old man, but they are all like Kim, they can’t bear to let him get frozen in the street, so they take the old Locke together. Into the hotel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, Father, how did you come here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is On that day, a generous person invited me to drink a drink. After I drank, I wanted to find a place to sleep, so I just found a place to lie down. I didn't think I woke up and found myself sleeping on a carriage. I stayed here for two weeks and I got here. But I am also very familiar here, just like home. Speaking of it, the carriage is really good, there are wine, bread and bacon, on it. There is no problem for how long you stay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sure!" Everyone thought so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 04<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, everyone got out of bed and finished grooming When I walked out of the room, I found that the room of the old Locke room was wide open, and there was only a messy quilt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The old guy ran away, it was a smart choice!" Lev groaned as he walked, and he had already guessed that this would happen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When everyone went to the hotel restaurant, there was no one in the restaurant. There was no one. It was the old man. He didn’t run away. Now there is breakfast in the restaurant! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Everyone, are you up? I didn't think that you young people can sleep more than my old man, so you can't be a good adventurer. But young is good. , like when I was young..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course!" The calm tone of the old man made everyone doubt the words of the Czech general. "I will take you to see the good place! But it takes two days to walk back and forth. I hope you will be prepared! Don't forget to buy some wine, I need them to moisten my throat!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Old man, is this the ancient site you said?" Lev forced his anger, if it was not an old man in front of him, he had already started! Anyone who has traveled for four hours to reach this destination in the Orc Wilderness finds that the fools will be angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes! That's it!" Old Locke said that these shameless words are not blushing, as if this abandoned mine was really what he called ancient times. The site is the same (in fact, this mine is also considered a site, perhaps really excavated in the era of the Holy Light Dynasty). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Father, are you sure you have not admit your mistakes?" Behan also had the last hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Young people, do you doubt my memory? I look so old? I can't remember where I am going." The old man’s words made everyone even more disappointed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the frustration of everyone, Old Locke suddenly understood: "Do you think I am lying? Young people, don't just look at things from the surface, this is a Truth, whether it is human or matter! Come, come in with me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can there still be a second choice? They all came here, and everyone had to pick up the prepared torches and follow the old Locke into the abandoned mine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mine is wet and dark, and from time to time there are a couple of mice running under the feet of everyone, causing Elna or the little girl to scream from time to time, sometimes Kim really can't understand women, they can bravely face Warcraft, but they are afraid of mice that are absolutely harmless to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little girl climbed Wei’s shoulder, but a bat flew past her, and she immediately climbed down again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Locke doesn’t seem to lie, he did come here, and he didn’t come once or twice, and he can see it from the way he walked the road. He is quite familiar with this place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s here!" Old Locke made a pleasant surprise. At this time, everyone has begun to get bored with walking in this cave. They followed Old Locke. Turn into a corner and walk into a new world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Great!" Kim secretly sighed in his heart, they are now in a big labyrinth, the ancient magician often in the residence to prevent the harassment of uninvited guests Building a maze around, Kim can now be sure that it is indeed a site of the Holy Light Dynasty! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone stopped and looked around carefully. They were all amazed at this magnificent building. It’s roughly inferred that this maze will take at least ten years. Time can be completed. The surrounding walls are made of the same blue bricks. All the passages are of the same size. Without a guide or map, no one knows where they are now! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Father, have you finished this labyrinth?" Lev's tone became more polite, and he knew he could not keep his direction in such a maze. This maze is quite dangerous for people who are not familiar with it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course!" Old Locke’s tone was dissatisfied. He refuted Lev’s question. "You thought I was not sure that I would take you casually." Into this dangerous place?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is moving in the depths of the maze, in which the vines (a vine) grow everywhere Plants, which grow in dark places without sunlight, glow, but not very bright), so everyone puts out the torch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the beginning, old Locke took the lead, but unwittingly, Old Locke was in the middle of the team. Old Locke walked and muttered as if he was endorsing. Kim was by his side and heard some "...turned to the right in the fourth corner, turned five turns and then turned left... the seventh crossroads went straight forward..." The old man obviously has already The movement of this maze has been carried over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's pay attention," Old Locke suddenly said loudly, "There should be a round button in front..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... Don't touch it, or there will be a lot of guardian beasts..." I don't know if Old Locke said it was too slow or Leif's action was too fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A secret door opened, and there were dozens of statue soldiers who were relying on magical activities. They launched an offensive against these intruders. The adventurers are inevitable, only to fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the people are exhausted and sit on the ground and gasp through this In the battle, this passage is in chaos. There are pieces of statue soldiers everywhere. Fortunately, there is a therapist in the team. You don't have to be afraid of being slightly injured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Young people, how can this be unsettled, do not wait for me to finish the action!" Old Locke did not know where to come from the cocky, just fighting When, God knows where the old man is hiding. "And the physical strength of even the elderly like me can not match, it is really a generation is not as good as a generation! Stand up and go on!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About 15 minutes Old Locke spoke again: "Come, pay attention, there is a glowing white button in front..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behan walked over, the button was obvious, In front of the button he walked, with the last lesson, everyone didn't dare to move. "Is this? I can't move it this time!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"...Do not forget to press and go forward, otherwise it will start the organization..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s too late, Lev has moved forward After several steps, the local vibration came and the trap opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a square trap on the ground, and all seven people were spared, all falling into it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s really painful. Everyone fell in this trap. After a long period of time, thick moss and fungus grow on the bottom of the trap. Plants, the traps have lost their deadly ability, but even so, the adventurers can't stand up at once, and even the old Locke can't be as eager as he was, and his painful waist can't stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The only exception is Babe, who fell on Kim when he fell, and there was nothing at all (Gold was miserable), her first Stand up and look around. There are also some light vines here, so it is generally clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this?" Babe saw a white thing, particularly prominent in a moss, but everyone is dying, no one cares about her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bebe went over and picked up the white thing (the little girl is really daring), that thing turned out to be an egg! An egg that is three times larger than an ordinary egg. The whole egg has no pattern and is white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Babe pondered what the egg was all about, other people began to recover from the pain, except for the old Locke, everyone with one Stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Father, didn't you break it?" Lev told Old Locke that he actually felt quite happy when he saw the old man fall into this way. However, after a while, the old man stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sister Elna! Look, what is this?" Babe took the egg to Elna. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"An egg? Where did you find it, Beibei?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Next, hey, it’s there!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is this egg? The white eggshell seems to emit a kind of luster, and Elna has never seen such a thing. She can't recognize what this egg is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others also noticed the things in the hands of Elna, and they also came over. Everyone started to discuss what this egg is in order to distract (the body is still hurting). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a dragon egg!" Old Locke said irresponsible words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dragon Egg?" Lev couldn't help but laugh. Although I have never seen the dragon, everyone knows that the dragon is 30 meters long and thirty. How can a long rice dragon give birth to such a small egg? If a dragon gives birth to such an egg, it must be a miniature dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Right, the magician brother, can you hatch this egg with magic?" Babe asked for gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 05<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know how to incubate with magic!" A helpless gesture, he has never heard of the use of magic to hatch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I beg you, the magician brother!" The little girl looked at Kim with a pitiful look that people could not refuse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I will try it." Gold put the egg on the ground and used a "fire vector" (this magic is all fire magic) The most basic, the effect is no different from the ordinary torch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone’s attention began to turn to serious things and began to think about how to get out of here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only Babe is concerned about the egg, even if it is a fire, the temperature is far beyond the requirements of the hatching egg - enough to cook eggs. Only after burning for a few seconds, Babe knew that if she did not stop the fire, she would be ready to eat a "baked egg." She began to work hard to extinguish the fire of magic. When Babe’s efforts finally succeeded, the egg was already red, and the red color of the barbecue. The little girl began to feel sad for the little life that was not born in the egg. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone will soon have a way out, the trap is not closed, as long as the gold uses flying magic to bring everyone out one by one. Old Locke proposed that it would be better to rest here for a while (soft, very comfortable), it seems that before the pain disappeared, the old Locke could not move. No one can lead the way in this maze, and everyone has to accompany the old Locke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, Father," Kim suddenly remembered one thing. "Do people in Hope City know this site?" He wants to confirm the Czech general. Have you lied to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In this world, only I know that there is such a place, of course, now you know it too!" Old Locke looks like a look, "I I accidentally discovered this place many years ago. I wanted to hide a big wind sand in this mine, but I accidentally found a map inside. I found this site according to the map. As long as I walked through this maze, the beauty inside can make You will never forget." Sure enough, the Czech general did not deceive them, and there is no reason to deceive them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bebe picked up the poor egg, the temperature on the egg was still very hot, no matter what animal it was, it seemed to have vanished. Suddenly, the egg seemed to move. Babe blinked. There was nothing wrong with it. The egg was moving. There was a crack in the eggshell. The crack gradually expanded and a life climbed out of the egg. Babe excitedly shouted and attracted everyone's attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very strange little animal, about the size and size of a duckling, smooth and soft skin, four legs on a chubby body, long neck There is a small head with two small protrusions on the back. Although it has just come out of the egg, it already has teeth and claws - certainly short. The animal also has a long tail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appearance of this little life fully proves everyone's guess, this is a magic-made species. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little guy opened his eyes for the first time, and in front of it was a babe looking at it with a look of concern, Beibei took this little thing In your hand, get your own eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little life climbed down from Babe’s hand and climbed into Babe’s arms. It rubbed Babe’s body with his head. Everyone is curious about this life, only Kim suddenly thinks of a possibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Babe, leave that thing, it may be poisonous!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Respond in Beibei In the past, Kim reached out and tried to grab the monster from Babe's body, but the little thing took a bite out of Kim's hand with his teeth. Although its small teeth can't cause a lot of damage, it is enough to bite the gold fingers. The gold handle was shrunk back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No poison!" Elna checked the gold wound announcement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have heard that animals will recognize the first thing they see as a mother, but they don't think it is true." Old Locke explained the small animals and shellfish. The reason for the hot weather. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course!" Babe replied immediately. "It can treat me as its mother!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you want to give it?" Na asked, she did not object to the adoption of this non-hazardous pet, and I heard that the magical life created by ancient magicians had many useful special abilities, and this should only be no exception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Baby!" The little girl didn't want to answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, baby babe, just a couple!" Lev is on the side, he doesn't think it's a good idea to bring a pet in an adventure, but Since Elna agrees, he is not good to object. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, make sure what it eats!" Behan suggested that if this is a carnivore, then throw it away, otherwise It doesn't matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bebe took out a little bread, and the little animal immediately ate the first meal since it was born. Now everyone is relieved about this strange animal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think, we should be on the road," Old Locke stood up. "The waist is finally hurting. Hey, old, can't keep up with you young." People..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold took everyone one by one with flying magic. Now everyone has learned the lesson, although it is slower, but still arrives It’s good to be behind the old Locke. Babe put the baby in his pocket, and the little animal fell asleep in the warm embrace of her mother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; finally came out of the maze, after everyone turned the last corner, A large abandoned underground palace appeared in front of everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A magic tower in front of the palace is still working, releasing a lot of light to provide illumination for the palace, but in addition to several visitors today, there are already No one has been here for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a wonderful feeling, everyone walked into this formerly splendid palace. Although this palace has been lost in the long river of history, there is no history book to record it, but visitors can infer it from the huge pillars that have been broken, the beautiful statues that have fallen down, the marble floors covered with fungi and moss in the gaps. How luxurious and magnificent it used to be. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking in the corridor of the palace, a faint sorrow enveloped everyone, the silence around, the beautiful carvings left on the wall, the light under the feet The marble gives a feeling of "the prosperity of the rich and the empty head", this feeling washes away everyone's heart. Everyone is in a state of silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone doesn't know where to go, they just follow the people in front of them silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a front door that was once magnificent. Under the inspiration of the old Locke, Kim and Behan forced the door to open, and the door handle was uploaded. Let the thoughts of gold drift, how many noble hands have touched the handle that has been rusted! But now, everything has become a thing of the past, and it has become nothingness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seven people walked into a hall, which, like other rooms, was given eternal lighting magic, as long as the magic tower outside the palace was At work, it is always bright, and the hall is still very well kept. Even the red carpet on the ground is almost intact. The end of the red carpet is the seat of the original owner of the palace - of course, it is empty now. Kim asked in a near-nightmous tone, "Who is this palace? Such luxury must be a big man."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Locke also uses a kind The nightmare replied: "The king of the magician, the Holy Light and the magic, here is his palace in the north. I really miss it!" His last voice was almost inaudible to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only Babe was the least affected by this atmosphere, she rushed up, jumped to the still brilliant throne, and sat down honestly and politely. Then loudly said to the following people: "You love Qing, flat... hahaha..." The little girl laughed almost straight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little girl’s laughter has restored everyone’s normal state, and everyone is now enjoying this luxurious hall. "Right," Locke said to everyone. "There is a very mysterious room over there. Would you like to check it out?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
