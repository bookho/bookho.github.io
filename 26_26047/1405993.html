			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 01<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When everyone walks to the gate of the city, Wei intends to take his heart When the idea told everyone, Lev suddenly pointed his hand to the city gate and said, "Look! Who is that!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You look at Lev’s hand There is a group of people around the city gate. It is the fat uncle in the crowd. He is still alive! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uncle Fat is now in the middle of the crowd, he seems to be pleading with a few adventurers, but it can be seen that the adventurers refused His request. There are probably some special reasons, and there are many people around watching it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The six people approached and they can now hear the voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please, please help me! I can make a lot of money!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Sorry, Uncle, this is really beyond our ability! Please go find those stronger people, even if we take this task, it is impossible to complete! Just how can we confront several adventurers? "The army of the half-orcs?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a voice in the crowd outside. "Friends, no hope! It’s useless to do anything now, you are not dead. Thank you very much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behan crowded the crowd, to be honest, he was very fond of this chubby uncle, he finally arrived at the uncle before. He can clearly see that Uncle Fat's face is full of despair and remorse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uncle Fat turned his head and saw Beyhan’s sight. This line of sight is very familiar. He immediately found out information about this person from his memory. The face gave him a deep memory. The last time he put the sword on his neck, he almost scared himself. He faintly recalled this person - maybe not this person, but must be one of them - to say "I want to hire us, wait until the end of the war!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "You, yes, that's you!" Uncle Fat used his finger to the six adventurers. "It's great to be able to find you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone in a hotel after listening to the fat uncle - now know his name is Matthew -. Things are very simple and very difficult. When Matthew was hiding in a warehouse, he saw from his door that his young master was taken away by the Orcs - fortunately he was not killed - but he could do nothing, so he now wants to find a group of adventurers to catch up with the first half. The orc, think of ways to save his young master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said Uncle!" Lev first stated, "This is going to die! I want to rescue the captives in their hands in the army of the Orcs. It’s just giving them a few more spoils!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“But we don’t have to fight with them! Just leave the person and leave without it?” Behan actually wants to help this poor housekeeper - this person is very similar to John who has been taking care of him, not looking, but other aspects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have to figure it out! This is not a human army, it is not as simple as changing a costume and mixing it up - it can be recognized at a glance. Are you confident to race against the wolf cavalry in the wilderness?" Lev immediately retorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can use magic! Just cover yourself with magic, and save people again. This, I believe that gold can do it." Han glanced at the magician who did not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Impossible! Captives are not one or two, thousands of tens of thousands! If you want to find one among so many people, no matter what It’s impossible for the magician to keep the hidden magic all the time!” Lev’s resolute opposition to this adventurous plan – it’s too dangerous, especially the rewards that match this danger – only 100 magic crystal coins (although A lot of it), and go to Undead Island to get 5000. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am going!" Wei expressed his meaning to his friends. His face shows that he is already ironic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey! I said, this is a life-saving thing! Are you really impatient? You have to go to die and go on your own, don't Come on me!" Leif was shocked by the expression of Wei, and he tried hard to stop him from doing this courageous move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wei, you have to think clearly..." Lev also wanted to make an effort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am going!" Wei repeated again, everyone - including Beibei - was very surprised, everyone together so much time, always thought that Wei is A dumb person did not think that the way he expressed his opinions this time was so strong that others could not shake his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am going too!" Behan expressed support. "I have to go too." Babe is just rushing into the fun. "You said it is right, baby?" The baby also put out a sigh of approval (???). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For this thought of losing money and being crazy, Lev can only resist weakly. After Elna said that he wants to go, he only surrendered. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, Uncle, now let's talk about the young man's looks!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" At the age of fifteen, the white skin, the hands and feet are very slender..." Matthew began to carefully describe the appearance of the young master, Wei listened to the heart, things will not be so coincidental! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Women wearing high-quality silk robe with special wear-free shoes on their feet (advanced travel gear, lightweight shoes crafted with magic, can minimize travel) Fatigue, and almost impossible to wear, but the price... is not acceptable to the general public...) "We interrupted Matthew's words, and he used gestures to describe the body of the boy he could remember." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Yes, how do you know?" Matthew felt very strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It was he who saved me, he was because I was caught!..." Wei said slowly to you about this matter. "...so, I must save him!" When Wei Shu said, everyone did not notice that Matthew's face had changed a lot! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, since we are going to save people, we will immediately prepare the necessary items!" Behan said immediately after listening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will help you buy it!" Uncle Fat is very attentive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After everyone else went out, he pulled the last Behan. "I said, is your dumb friend a nobleman, oh no? Does he have noble blood?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Noble? Not very likely!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" That should be at least a knight!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, he is from the dark continent!" It’s strange, is Wei Chang like a nobleman? Also, he is really handsome and very aristocratic. How did he not notice it before? However, he should not have any interest in Elna. Behan was thinking about it and following other people out of the store. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dark continent!" Uncle Fat stopped at Behan and thought about it. "This is hard to do! He can't do anything!" Even a barbarian! I hope that the kind of thing I guess doesn't happen! Don't think about it, now put the rescuer first!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon, in Under the generosity of Uncle Fat, six people were equipped with all the essentials for wilderness travel and began to set off. Now everyone is afraid of one thing - the half-orcs have been away for more than a week, and they can't catch up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Going forward in the Orc Wilderness is a very difficult thing. Whether it is the sun that can be cooked or the ridiculousness of the endlessness, people feel the deadness of this wilderness. If there is anything better than the desert, it is that the gravel is harder than the sand. Have a down-to-earth feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadow of six people and four horses has been in this wilderness for four days. So far, no shadow of the half-orc army has been found, in order to prevent The half-orc rides and they are divided into three echelons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the first Behan waved his hand to the companion behind him, and he had discovered the traces left by the Orc march. Behan’s experience as a mercenary has now played a big role, and now he has replaced Lev as a scout. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s been dead for at least six days!" Behan reached the conclusion by picking up the almost dried arm of his body. The deceased should be a captured soldier, who was killed by a spear with a hole in his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If we say this, we should have six days from the half-orc! I hope they can slow down, otherwise they may not be able to catch up!" Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassure, in order to prevent human pursuit, the Orcs will go all out in the first week, but then there will be some time to rest in one place! We can definitely catch up!” Behan is very confident. “Now we should be one to three days away from the half-orcs. From tomorrow, everyone should be careful!”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night, everyone is sitting next to the campfire and they start discussing their rescue plan again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adventurers’ plans are very thorough. First, they will have to catch up with the Orc’s army and then let a person dressed as a captive and mix into the captive team— - Of course, it is mixed under the cover of magic. Others wait for the companion's signal while moving forward with the Orcs. Wait until the person who gets in and out finds the target and sends a special signal when it is unobtrusive. Then Kim uses magic to find the target, leaving with two people - this should be achievable. Finally, everyone fled with the fastest speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key to this plan is two points. One must find the boy in time, and the other is to keep pace with the half-orcs. Everyone is now struggling with these two questions. Especially the first one, because they don't know how the half-orcs manage their captives, so they don't know if they can find their goals smoothly. Be aware that when the Orcs return to their territory, nothing is done. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 02<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look, oasis!" Lev pointed at the green yelling in the distance This is really an exciting news. You know, anyone who is seeing a vibrant green land in this ghost-free place will be very excited. But all the people immediately calmed down after the initial excitement, they found a place to hide, and then Jin flew to the green. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This oasis is quite large in size, and Kim has been watching it for a long time in the air, and finally confirmed that there are no half-orcs here, at least there are no half-orcs. Five people immediately cheered and rushed to the oasis after seeing the safety signal from the blonde. Even the four horses who have walked up and are already weak can run up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the oasis, everyone released the reins of the horses, let them go to eat fresh grass that had not been eaten for a while, they began to look for water sources- ─ Water bags really need to be added. There was not much time, they joined with Kim, and under the lead of gold--he had seen the river when he was in the air--and everyone soon heard the sound of flowing water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s in front! Six people have stepped up, but everyone was stunned when they reached the river. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of them is a bloody scene. At the riverside, there are at least a thousand human bodies, which fall to the ground. Most of the grass on the river was dyed red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This...what is the matter!" Of course, it was also asked, no one here can live to answer this question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are dozens of big trees beside them, each with a nail on it, nailed to the hands, feet, shoulders, and thighs -- It can make the victims suffer in the hours before they die -- these people have been mad for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A captive riot, trying to escape..." Behan said in a heavy tone that the half-orc, in order to kill a hundred, after killing the escaped captives, The backbone of them was nailed to the tree. The traces of the struggles left behind are not very obvious, indicating that they were quickly suppressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really cruel!" Elna wiped the eyes of a crucified man with his hands. This man did not close his eyes, his face. The expression shows how much pain he has suffered. Although humans often kill captives, they never use this cruel method<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behan carefully analyzed the bodies, these crucified people died Less than two days, this shows that the Orcs have been in this oasis for a long time, and it also shows that the Orcs are not far away from them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, with the help of Warcraft called by Babe, everyone piled up the bodies together, and gold burned them with flame magic. Everyone looked at the flame with a deep heart. If there is any good news, it is that their goal is not in the middle of these bodies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The six adventurers are staying in this oasis today, they are very tired today, and because the half-orcs are definitely gone, they have not arranged to stand guard. Players. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night, Lev couldn’t sleep, and the scene of the day was still lingering in his mind. To be honest, he didn’t want to It will become like this in the future. "This is really dangerous. It is impossible to save the captives in the Orc army! There is no magic in the world that can cover up the smell. The wolf cavalry will find us easily, and then we will also crucify us." Just like those poor worms!" If you are killed by a knife, you can forget it, but this kind of death is true... He has no way to fall asleep, even though he is very tired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leif opened his eyes, the gold around him had already made a slight snoring, and he had already slept very well. Lev opened the cup and walked out of the simple tent. The bonfire outside was almost extinguished, but there was a little bit of light and heat - but it didn't help much to withstand the cold in the desert night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lev is sitting next to the campfire, his hand inadvertently playing with a small grass, standing up after making the grass a few paragraphs, he intends to blow The cold wind at night calms down my heart. "This is not fear, it is not fear, I have never been afraid of anything!" Lev said to himself again and again. What I saw today evoked memories of his youth. He also vaguely remembered the situation at the time—when he climbed out of the bottom of the hiding car, the kind old businessman was lying in front of him, his There were countless knife marks on the body, and the cruel robbers killed the old man with a knife. The expression on the face of the businessman who kindly adopted him is the same as those who are crucified today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After so many years, I thought I had forgotten it, but this memory is just hiding in a corner that I can’t find. After seeing the dead today, The horror of this young age returned to his heart and covered his heart like a shadow that could not be touched but did exist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not the same!" Lev yelled at the shadow. "I am now an adventurer who can protect myself. The child at the bottom of the car!" But the shadow is still in his heart, not shaken by his voice! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unconsciously, Lev had already reached the place where they burned the body--that is, the stream, the front seems to be someone! Lev immediately hid his body in the shadow of a tree - completely out of the instinctive action of an adventurer! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is actually someone in front of what, the person’s figure is familiar, right, it’s Elna! What is she doing here! The night is already deep, she should sleep in the tent with Babe! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leif is getting closer, now I can see what Elna is doing, she is digging with a small shovel, and the ground has appeared. A big pit, but she is still digging! "What is she going to do?" Lev was a bit strange. Elna was already very tired. It seems that she has been working alone for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right!" Lev understood what Elna was doing, and she had to dig a grave that could hold all the ashes. However, it is obvious that she has not done this kind of digging work. Her technique of using a shovel is very poor, and the typical thing is half the effort. By the moonlight, it can be seen that her face is all sweaty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aerna rubbed the sweat on her face with her hand. This shovel is too small, she can’t work with it very quickly, if If you dig this grave, it will take at least half an hour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hand stretched out from behind Elna, took the shovel from her hand, and Elna looked back and saw that Lev was using her. The small shovel excavated. Lev's technique is very skilled, and the shovel is twice as efficient in his hand as Elna. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alna quietly stood and watched Lev dug, and the cold wind at night quickly dried her sweat. Now that Lev and Elna are in a tacit understanding, neither of them speaks. Lev was very fast, and he quickly dug the tomb to the right size! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After putting in all the ashes, Lev buried the tomb with a shovel, and Elna inserted a bluestone plate that was accidentally found in front of the tomb as a tombstone for the tomb. After the adventurers set off tomorrow, only this wordless tombstone along with this nameless grave will be left to explain to future generations that there have been such a number of victims who do not know their names. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the way back to the camp, the two people still did not speak. After returning to the camp, the two people split their hands without saying a word, and each returned to their own In the tent, however, invisible, the distance between the two has been much closer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leif was lying in his bed, and the gold next to him was still in a sweet dream, and he did not find that he had gone out for a turn. Just lying down, Lev suddenly felt extremely sleepy, and he quickly fell asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, six people left the oasis and continued to trace the trail left to the half-orcs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The six people are hiding in a small earth cave, this can not be Known as a hole, it can only be called a hole. It can barely squeeze six people. Above the cave, the Orc's Griffin cavalry is hovering. Everyone can only be in this hole now - it is so lucky to find this hole - to escape the sharp vision of the Griffin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adventurers chased the Orc army yesterday evening, but the half-orcs are really powerful, with a sharp glance in the daytime, at night There is a sense of smell of the wolf, which is impeccable at all, and there is no way to find a hole. Although the Orcs are now far away from the enemy's territory, the marching speed is very slow, but the alert is not a little relaxed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lev, fortunately you proposed to leave the horse in that oasis!" Kim said as he looked at the gryphon in the sky--now the Griffin has left. The adventurer's sky, flying in the direction of the main force - "otherwise we will be discovered!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing, this is common sense!" Lev replied "In order to reduce the burden, some spare parts will be left every other way, so you can use those supplies when you go back!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you put that? Only the damn griffin is bombarded with magic!” Babe suggested. “If it has been flying in the sky, we can only hide in this hole forever! I call a flying World of Warcraft to deal with it!” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 03<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don’t talk, babe!" Behan said very calmly. "It’s easy to get rid of that griffin, but does this tell the enemy that we are here? As I thought, the enemy guards are doing very well, we have to follow It’s very difficult to face, so..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand!" Kim said, "We must find a way to return to the center or front of the Orc army. The vigilance in those places is lax, and we are likely to have a chance! So, babe, let it be!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this It’s not a comfortable thing to squeeze in the hole. Everyone has no way to move. Only the outermost gold can stick out the head and look at the outside situation. The baby couldn’t stand it in the pocket of Babe, and it climbed outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The baby’s body is a little bigger – this is mainly due to the fact that Babe feeds it with food every time, with full nutrition. Long is fast! Now the baby has the size of more than half of the fist, plus the prominent belly, it is very cute! (Everyone like Lev, everyone thinks this way)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The baby climbed onto Babe’s leg and it began to suck hard, as if to do something. "It's bad!" Kim immediately reacted - this little thing is going to be a bowel movement - he quickly grabbed the baby whose body began to rise and threw it outside the cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the baby is not as intriguing as everyone thinks, it keeps inhaling, the body keeps rising, it has now risen at least twice as much. . Everyone focused their attention on this little animal. No one knew what the little animal was doing. In order to prevent it, Kim showed a protective magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The baby’s body continues to rise, it’s already three times the original. If it goes up again, this little thing will soon be broken. Sure enough, the little guy's body quickly appeared a big crack, Babe gave a scream, Lev was secretly happy, this little guy was saved, probably life is up, some magical creatures are very Short-lived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's suede!" Behan first reacted. Indeed, the baby's skin began to shrink, and its entire body began to drill out of the outer skin. The baby came out and screamed and jumped into the arms of Babe. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what the baby looks like! Everyone looked at the little animal carefully. Its body is now very smooth. It seems that there is a layer of glowing matter on the outside of the body. The other parts are not changed much, but the two small protrusions on the back are now gone. Instead, they are replaced. It’s a pair of small wings, although it’s still very weak, but it’s true that it’s a pair of wings. When everyone was amazed, Babe threw the baby on the top of his head in cheers. When he fell, the baby could fly in the air with these wings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, the level of danger has increased at least tenfold!" Lev’s heart secretly calculated, and he now regrets why he didn’t pack the monster earlier, now it It will fly, and it will never be lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this boring morning, only the baby’s suede is the only interesting thing. Under the surveillance of the Griffin, everyone can’t even lift it. However, after leaving the adventurers within the scope of the Griffin, the adventurer began to move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All is as expected by Behan, at night, gold to the half-orc When the first reconnaissance was carried out in the military camp, the protection of the half-orcs was very lax, and Kim even felt that the cover magic that he had added to his body had any effect. Almost all the orcs were sleeping, I am afraid I can't even beat it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orc’s army has 500,000, and their captives are hundreds of thousands. The camp of this nearly one million team is really big. A person is like a needle in a haystack. However, the adventurer did not have a plan to achieve the goal at all. The goal of Kim’s reconnaissance was to confirm the status of the prisoner and prepare for the next move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the adventurers expected, the Orcs did not manage the prisoners separately, and all the prisoners were brought together to be monitored by an army, they are now The only half-orc who is still awake - at least half awake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden swaying through the camp in the captive camp, he was not afraid to be found by the half-orcs guarded by spears. The hard marches in the wilderness in the past few days, even the strong and hard-working half-orcs are a bit too much to eat, let alone humans. When Kim walked into the rudimentary big tents, those prisoners were already asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The management method of the Orcs is simple and effective. All humans are tied up with hands, and the ropes that bind the hands are connected to a long rope. - It seems like a fish that is worn with straw ropes - so there will be no individual escapes. At the same time, strict control of food and water, so that humans can not escape - no food and water, only to die in this wilderness. This preventive measure is very effective. The hard march and the lack of food and beverages have exhausted the human body. They simply have no extra strength to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seeing a few tents, Kim lost the idea of ​​finding a target right away. He wanted to find the little devil named Mingke in so many tents. It can't be done in one night. From the current speed of the Orcs, they have about three weeks to complete the work. If you are lucky, there should be no problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Orc camp, under a tent with a camouflage cloth in the same color as the rock, six adventurers began to discuss the rescue plan. The people who have mixed into the captive group have already decided - Lev is now dressed as a cloak, and he is very careful to hide his equipment very well - Kim believes that now is the time to let Lev mix in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, let's go right away!" Lev grabbed a hand on the ground and wiped it on his face. "The magic mark on my body is not Will the Orcs discover it?" He asked again without hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is absolutely no problem! You don't even believe me?" Kim is also very worried about telling the truth. You must know that Lev will depend on him all the time. Own, if the half-orc found that there was one more prisoner, Lev was in danger of escaping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right! Bring the baby up too! This little guy will definitely help!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Thank you!" Leif refused, and if the little monster was accidentally squeezed by himself in his arms, he would immediately reimburse himself. Although it is really powerful, this monster is never trustworthy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lev was lying in the middle of the captive with the help of Kim. His hand was tied up like other captives, but the knot was very clever, as long as both hands were able to be broken, and, in case of prevention, Lev hid a small knife in his wrist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, Kim, remember to bring something good tonight," Lev said again when Kim left. "I think the half-orc is absolutely not Will give me something good to eat!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day is bright, the captives are The whip of the guard's whip was awakened, and it was another day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lev was mixed in the middle of the captive. The strange thing was that the people next to him did not ask how this guy appeared! But Lev quickly understood what was going on - just at noon! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun is really hot! Lev still didn't know that the sun of the Orc Wilderness was so sinister. He had always had a sunscreen cloak on his body, which made him forget the terrible sunshine. Compared with the daylight on the head, the water that the captives can get is very limited. They can only make them barely able to survive. If they don't have good physical strength, it will take life if they go on a day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the sun treats all life equally, and the half-orcs must hurry under the heat. So, after an hour of walking, the captives can get a ten-minute break under a large shed that is supported, plus a sunscreen on top of several pillars. If you do not take such measures, then now the captives have already died more than half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At rest, Lev clearly saw that the Orcs pulled out a comatose person in the prisoner's team that looked emaciated. For the half-orc, this person has no need to live, he will only waste things in vain. However, to be honest, this is really a relief for this poor worm. Lev now knows why it’s not surprising that people are strangers around you – this team is constantly changing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike the people who can only be numb tough steps, Leif’s conditions are much better, and he has gold to protect him in advance. And Elna left a treatment on him, coupled with the original physical conditions, although a little bit hard, but Lev has enough energy to carefully observe the people around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orc did not find a dangerous guy in the middle of the prisoner. Lev’s costume was very successful and did not attract any suspicion. They did not even pay much attention to the captive team, so that Lev had full freedom to complete his task. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, there is no here! Leif ignored the look of the guy behind him, detached from the position of the long rope he was now, and then hung himself to another long rope position - it was so bold, if seen by the Orcs, Lev There is no rescue - he does not know how to change a few positions, but has not found his goal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the next break, Lev was very negligent in changing the queue, but it was not discovered by anyone. But today Lev did not have any results. At the time of camping at dusk, Lev still did not find people with similar goals. It seems that he can only wait for tomorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 04<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night, Kim easily found Lev according to the magic mark. He came to listen to today's situation (by the way, bring some water and food. Lev expressed his concern to Kim - maybe that Mink is dead. Today, Lev found no one is fifteen years old. Left and right people, young people of this age may not have enough physical strength to persist for so long - they may have been disposed of by the Orcs.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If true In that case, we have no way. Now we can only do our best!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In the half-orc team for a week - before Lev's patience was completely wiped out - Lev finally saw a figure very similar to the target.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a 14-year-old boy. His appearance is a bit similar to that described by Uncle Fat, but he looks awkward now, without the kind of aura that Wei described. The Orcs didn’t because He is a teenager and gives him a lot of preferential treatment. His hands and others Kind of rope tightly tied up, the rest of the time is often pushed to the closest place to the sun of others <br <br /> & nbsp />;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;"Minke!" Lev screamed softly, but the juvenile's body did not react. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mingke!" The voice was a lot louder, and the young boy in the front finally shook. But he just shook his head - mistaken for the auditory hallucination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leif’s confidence increased, he took a few steps, and now his distance from the previous teenager is quite close, at this distance, he can use The light voice made this teenager very clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mingke!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young boy in front turned his head, this time the voice He determined that this was not the illusion that the sun was fainting. There was indeed someone calling him, and the voice came from behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teenager turned his face, behind him was a person he did not know, but he could see it at a glance, he was not a prisoner. The man's clothes were as dirty as everyone else, and his face was equally dirty, but now he is blinking at himself - he is still energetic now, and is different from those who have been squeezed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who are you?" The boy's dry lips squeezed out a few hoarse voices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't make a sound! Go back and you will be noticed by the Orcs!" The boy turned his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are called Mink?" The boy nodded when he heard the question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you know a fat uncle called Matthew? Who is he?" Lev asked another question, now it’s already eighty-nine. But, you should also confirm it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uncle Matthew! The boy’s heart began to get excited immediately. He already knew what it was all about. Uncle Matthew is him. The person behind him should be the adventurer he hired. He is here to save me! This is saved! I thought I was finished this time. I didn't think that the savior was finally here. This is good, nothing happened! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of hope is endless, and the body just like a puppet is immediately rejuvenated, and the numb mind is beginning to work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is my steward!" The young boy calmly said that he had prepared the words well. When they came out to travel, they compiled this answer to face similar The problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay! The hard days have finally come to an end!" Lev’s ecstasy in his heart, now just keep up with this goal. As long as he passed this evening, he can use the sunscreen cloak, and the taste of the sun in the sun is really uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you arrested by a half-orc to save a warrior?" Lev suddenly asked the question, apparently he wanted to confirm the identity of the boy again. I actually want to know if Wei’s words are true. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you know the warrior?" The boy asked, and he began to feel that the adventurer knew too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He called Wei! Kid, thank you after you go back, otherwise I will not take this risk to save you! Ok, now don't start Speaking, being seen by the Orcs is a flaw!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At rest, the two men drank the water that was definitely not enough, watching the boy’s longing Eyes, Lev had to take out a small water bag, take a sip of his own, and then handed it to the teenager. Mink - we call him this time - take the water bag and drink half in one breath! The two men are now in a very inconspicuous corner, and Lev deliberately obscures the sight of others, so no one has found that Mink is drinking water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minke returned the water bag to Lev with a satisfied look, but Lev shook his hand. "You keep it yourself, when you are thirsty in the afternoon." Drink." - Anyway, the matter is overnight, this water bag will be given to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For creatures walking in this wilderness, water is more necessary than food. After drinking at noon, the spirit of Mink afternoon is much better. His steps have become more stable and powerful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do we get out of here?" Mink asked again. People are really very interesting creatures. A few hours ago, Mink had been praying to the gods to drink water and have a good time. After his wish was fulfilled, he began to hope for more things - free. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was soon after the afternoon break, but something unforeseen happened at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the captives walked under the big shed and got water, the person in front of the Mink fainted, the poor guy fell down On the ground, the entire long rope was touched. At this point, the hard-working friend in front of Mink, a 30-year-old soldier, was getting water, not coming and drinking, the long rope shaking, and the bowl of water was spilled on the ground under the influence of this sudden force. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minck looked at the desperate face of the man in front of him, and the fainted person was immediately pulled out by the Orcs, but they did not Give the person in front of Mink the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minck looked at the eyes of the difficult friend in front, his eyes were desperate, this kind of appearance can touch the lion - if the lion can be touched . But the half-orcs did not pay attention to the captives. For them, these captives were only slaves—just like ordinary animals. It was his own fault that the water was gone. He had little to do with his death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mingke couldn’t help it, he quietly handed his water bag—and some water inside—to the uncle’s hand— This move was entirely from good intentions and did not take into account the consequences. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a glimpse of what the young boy behind came over, the man immediately understood what it was. He immediately lifted the water bag and drank it. water. But thirst made him lose his calm, his movements were too conspicuous, and everyone saw it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pair of hands tied with a rope stretched over and took the water bag away. The predator immediately pointed the mouth of the water bag to his mouth and began to drink. water. Then there was another pair of hands, and more and more people were robbing them. The unbearable thirst made them lose control and began to snatch the small water bag. In the end, almost all of the people in the shed were involved in the battle for this water bag. Only two of the initiators were not crazy because of this water bag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the chaos, the last water in the little water bag is not in the mouth of the looters, it is spilled on the ground, later People can be said to be meaningless competition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The turmoil caught the attention of the Orcs, and the Orc guards rushed over and the whip fell to the head of the human. The fear brought by the whip finally suppressed the chaos. On one side, Lev and Mink clearly saw the half-orc picking up the chaos of the chaos from the ground - a not very big water bag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now is no longer a time to condemn this sympathetic boy, Lev put a hand on his waist and hit the handle of a knife . In case something happens, then you have to kill one enough and kill two to earn one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-orc carefully looked at the water bag in his hand, he did not think that this water bag was brought in by a daring adventurer, according to common sense, This water bag should be a captive that was stolen from a half-orc. No matter who you lose the water bag, but this guy who has the ability to steal things is definitely a dangerous person and should be resolved soon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orc used a glimpse of the captive in this shed, he was looking at the suspicious guy, when his eyes came, Lev Lower your head and escape the attention of the Orcs with the least outstanding gesture. The Orcs did not find suspicious guys, all the prisoners were almost the same - a weak, weak look. In the middle of the captives, there is no such special spirit because of enough water and food. Lev's disguise is really excellent, and it is really an excellent thief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Search it! The Orc's leader made a gesture, and several orcs began searching for prisoners one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leif’s heart began to get nervous. The equipment on his body could not escape the search of the Orcs. He began to hide himself in the most inconspicuous movement. Later, while delaying the time is also away from Mingke, since the bloody battle is inevitable, then at least do not involve him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Mink is also following Lev, his actions are not planned, but entirely instinct, and he also has reasons not to be searched by half-orcs. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 05<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orcs search for prisoners one by one, these half-orcs are unprepared To face a fully armed adventurer, they did not expect an adventurer to be captured. Except for a half-orc (the leader) who still holds the whip and stands there, the half-orcs who are performing the search mission are not prepared, and their weapons are hung in the waist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Lev seems to have no movement on the surface, all the muscles in his body are tight and tight, and all his attention is focused on the unsuspecting half-orc who is slowly approaching himself - the guy is Searching all the way - his eyes are beating dangerous light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This doesn't know who is lucky - the half-orc has not gotten all the way, so he turned around when he was close to Lev, he gave up After continuing to search the team, Lev and Mink were not searched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orc leader looked at the water bag in his hand, and he looked at his own department and found nothing. This water bag is probably the only thing that these captives stole - since If you don't come out, it's better to kill all these prisoners - about 700. He did not find that he had just escaped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Orcs searched, humans are beginning to consider this question. Where did the water bag from now? Although almost everyone has almost joined the competition, no one knows the origin of this water bag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Levf’s glance at Mink, the compassionate teenager’s head was lowered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader of the Orc has dispelled the idea of ​​killing the captives in such a way that his superiors will recognize him as an incompetent person and he will lose his promotion. Hope - he decided not to be like this. This just saved him and the thief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orcs retired from the captive group, and now it is the turn of mankind to pursue the origin of this water bag. People look at me, I look at you, everyone knows what the water bag must have. Because of the chaos just now, no one except a few people knows where this water bag originated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lev disguised himself in the most inconspicuous manner, but he knew that Mink’s behavior could escape the search of the Orcs (it was all lucky) but Absolutely can't hide the eyes of difficult friends. To be honest, Lev is very eager to save all those who suffer, but as an adventurer, you need to know the difference between ideal and reality. If you want to save all the people, you can't save them, but you have to accompany yourself. Moreover, Lev also knows that under these conditions, human beings almost do not have "modesty", and everyone is hoping that they will be saved - especially around them who are not known before. Based on the above considerations, Lev decided to bring Mink out first, and then depending on the situation, do what he can. But now that the kid has revealed the secret, it is likely to bring unexpected obstacles to his actions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no one has noticed the existence of Lev, and everyone is paying attention to Mink--the water bag is from the hands of Mink, Then there may be more things in his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole afternoon, Lev is considering the obstacles that may come. He made guesses about all kinds of accidents and developed his own methods to deal with these accidents, but people After all, it is not omnipotent, and Lev is not likely to consider all the circumstances. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night finally arrived, the half-orcs plunged into the camp, and they drove the already exhausted prisoners into the rudimentary tents. After a day of fatigue, everyone was already tired, but there were a few people who didn't sleep. They all paid close attention to the boy. Because he got enough water, his spirit was much better. They all felt that today should be What will happen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minck and Lev are certainly not going to fall asleep. After the half-orc guard at the door made a loud grunt, Lev quietly rose. He pointed an eye to a crack in the tent. The situation outside today is no different from peacetime. It is great that the Orcs did not guard the water bag because of the water bag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leif walked to Mink’s side, he took a picture of the boy’s shoulder, and the boy immediately sat with a gentle movement that would never be discovered. When he got up, Lev cut the rope in his hand with a knife. At the time of the youth's activities, Lev carefully looked at the tent - all the captives were motionless, and it seemed that they all slept very well. Even the thief's keen eye can't find out among the hundreds of people in the dark who are pretending to sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leif asked Mink and he to go to the corner of the tent door, so that even if the half-orc came in, he could not see the two. There are no human beings bound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two did not wait for a long time, a man wearing a magician’s gown walked into the tent with a light footstep, and the two half-orc guards outside did not find it. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Found it, and seeing the people around Lev, Kim knew that Lev had completed his mission. Although he was not very clear at night, he was obviously a teenager. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leave it right away?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard, of course Leave now! What are we going to do here? The two guards outside will not find out?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The two guys are sleeping, I won't find it! Come and release a magical figure for you, so that you can safely get out of this place without touching the wolf cavalry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "You mean we will meet the wolf cavalry? Is this cursing me?" The victory was in sight, and Lev couldn't help but make a joke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, don't laugh, I want to start magic!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the gold When I was about to start using magic, a voice - not too big - came from among the captives who should have been sleeping: "Wait a minute, take me with me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp Everyone is stunned, a captive on the ground sits up, with a faint light, and Lev can recognize that he is the one who accepted Mink's water bag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just before the three people had reacted, the voice rang again, and several people sat up, and they all demanded that the adventurer take him out of the captive camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lev! It seems that you are too careless!" The original meaning of gold is that Lev is too careless, so it is easy to be half exposed. The orcs found out, but those captives misunderstood the meaning of gold. They thought that the adventurers would not take them away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Take me back, I can give you a lot of money, my family is very rich!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Take me back, my father will definitely pay you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Leif shrugged his shoulders. If you want to take so many people - there are more than a dozen, their support is not enough, it seems that you have to go to the Orcs to get some. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Everyone, I don't want your reward..." Kim's words brought more doubts to those who were full of doubts and uneasiness. And uneasy, they did not consider things to the good side, and said half of the sentence as a refusal of the adventurer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A person sat up from the ground, and he interrupted the words of gold with a threatening tone: "If you don't take me away, I will scream out loud. Then you can't go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What! Lev simply didn't believe his ears, and someone would say such things. The man took the shock of the adventurers as a fear, and he repeated it again: "Take me away, otherwise I will call out loud!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a moment Several captives all made the same voice: "If I don't take me, I will call out loud. Then you can't go!" Most of them are guards in the city. They are used to threats. Grasp and convince others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but these words can only cause Lev’s resentment. If everyone is in a soft language, he will accept it, but he does not like to threaten. Call! So you are determined to be a slave for a lifetime! Don't think that I will be afraid, since we can come in, of course, we can go out!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unconsciously, The voice of the conversation gradually grew bigger. A few people who were not sleeping deeply woke up. After they figured out what happened, they immediately knew that this was the only chance for them to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone began to plead with the adventurer, someone used to threaten the adventurer, and some promised a high reward to the adventurer. The voice constantly awakens the new prisoners, and the captives make a louder voice. Now everything is in a vicious circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two adventurers looked at each other a bit, they knew that this could not continue, they had to make a decision right away, otherwise they could not go - - Even if they are gone, Mink is definitely not taking it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
