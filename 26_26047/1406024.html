The hand of the husband. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What we just heard! It’s that he killed your mother!" Lev shakes everything out, no matter what Elna Can't accept it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Impossible!" Elna stepped back and shook her head to say that she did not believe it. "How can a teacher of law be..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here!" With this voice, a fireball flies, hits the wall, and the flames splash. . Fortunately, this voice first reminded people that they did not suffer any damage from this magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go!" Old Rock stepped forward and pulled Elna hard, regardless of her struggles. The strength of this old man actually made Elna unable to break free and was pulled out by him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seven people ran forward along the passage, Jin Kailu, Wei was at the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The short pause just made them lose the best time to escape. Now a group of magicians are catching up, and several therapists are in them. intermediate. Fortunately, the other side of the action did not have any precautions, so there was a situation in which someone chased after him and no one in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several strong acid balls and explosive balls flew over in the back, so that they could not dodge, but Wei promptly angered, offsetting these magic attacks. The acid was forcibly stopped and fell to the front of the sender, which hindered their progress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This opportunity, the distance between the two sides has opened again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A ramp appears in front of it, and the exit is on the left. The magician ran over without hesitation, but one of them stretched out behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Stupid, the main entrance can not go, there are four guards guarding!" Jin looked back, is the old Locke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go here!" Old Locke took the lead and ran to the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is another downward slope. Now Lev begins to understand why this auxiliary sacrifice does not allow others to come in because there are many passages. To the underground ruins that seem to not allow outsiders to know the existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The footsteps of the chasing afterwards suddenly approached, and the speed of the enemy’s chase did not know why it was speeding up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is to strengthen magic!" Kim understands what happened. Using Intensive Magic can increase your speed and power in a short time, and the magicians use enhanced magic for their companions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person behind him was close to the Wei after the high-speed, and there was a gust of wind in his ear. Wei instinctively turned his head to avoid it, just hiding the punch that hit the head. But the first time I hid, but I couldn't hide the second, and the two attacks were all in one go. Wei Lian turned his head and had no sturdy back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a pain in the back, and the heavy force was drilled through the armor. Originally enough to kick the horse down, but with the protection of the armor, Wei just took a few steps forward without falling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We turned over and the figure has already rushed up. The speed is almost illusory, and a white shadow flashes, and the enemy rushes to the front. With the close combating skills of the boxing fighters coupled with the stimulating of the magic, even Wei is difficult to parry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warrior wants to reach out to catch the enemy, but an elbow hits his chest first and then takes him back a few steps. Without weapons in his hands, Wei’s ability would not be able to play, and his melee fighting skills could not compete with these boxing fighters anyway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others have already caught up, and the fighters smacked their anger before the enemy rushed over and forced them back temporarily. In addition to the attack beyond the boxing fighter's intentions, he was rushed to death and fell back like a kite. Hit the back of the person. Wei Zeyi took this opportunity out of the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The four are the same!" Old Locke replied. But this time a voice of a magic spell came from behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... Cover my enemy's eyes with your cloak!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Give this underground world The radiance of the light vine that provided that little bit of poor illumination disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Run! Don't be afraid, just grab the direction and you will be able to reach the exit!" Only the old Locke's call and the enemy's flame magic remain in the darkness. Attack trajectory drawn in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Locke has long held her hand and she doesn’t know when it’s loose. Now Elna is running alone. It’s ironic that in this place where she lived for more than a decade, there was such a space she didn’t know. There was no sound behind him, and Elna began to slowly stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of magic slowly disappeared, and the surroundings began to become clearly visible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alna now seems to be in a room - it should be said that it was once a room, surrounded by fallen walls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Alna!" A familiar and majestic voice came, and a figure appeared in the doorway of this room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"False teacher!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is almost no difference between the appearance of the law and the state of mind Still maintaining the kind of smooth and majestic appearance, but I don't know why, the original kind feeling is no longer there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They said that you killed my mother... Tell me... this is not true!" After a brief silence, Elna spoke, her The voice is not so much a question as it is a pleading. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...is true!" The words spit out the words from the mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As if the last string was broken, Elna suddenly flew and slammed into the door. However, the movement of the law is faster, and when the time is not allowed, both hands are up, and this rapid blow is caught. Then his hands twisted and sent, and Erna's body was pushed open and almost fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why? Why are you doing this?" Elna shouted loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why? You won't understand..." The voice was interrupted, because Erna rushed up and made up with fists and legs. A dazzling attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The law slightly retreated a bit, he just closed his hands and completely sealed the entire attack of Elna. Along with the gap that emerged from the last action, an elbow hit the side of Erna and flew her out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How many times have I told you, Elna, boxing is a defensive skill over attack, you are so crazy attack and not defensive, only let You fail in the gap in front of your opponent!" The law is cold and cold, the tone is the same as when guiding Alna. "Our fists are faced with swords and magic, so we must pay attention to speed, and only when the opportunity is right can we gather together - these things I teach you seem to have forgotten!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why do you want to do that?" Elna reluctantly stood up again, just now. Although the law has begun to age, his power has not been affected at all. "Why do this kind of thing! When the demon's hand!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because he promised to let me rejuvenate, let me regain my youth!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Elna looked at the former teacher in front of her with unbelievable eyes. "You have betrayed us for this... The goddess taught you to forget? We You can't forcibly retain the life that is destined to die! You actually killed the mother for this!" In the fury, she rushed again, but the law approached her with a speed that was simply ghostly, hitting her stomach with a fist. . This made Elna's entire body curl up because of the pain, and fell to the ground and could not move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You betrayed us for this..." Elna said with a faint voice she could only make. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the body is almost unable to move, the sound of the law is still clearly introduced into the ear of Elna. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I... was sent to this shrine when I was eight years old... My parents spent a lot of money to send me in and learn to be a therapist... ... It took me 15 years to get the qualification of a primary therapist. It took me ten years to upgrade to an intermediate therapist... By the time I became a senior therapist, it was fourty-five years old! When I was When I finally reached my goal, I realized that my hair was already white. Can you understand my feelings? How can you know the feeling of ordinary people like me?" What is contained in the voice is sorrow and anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For so many years, I have been working hard all the time, not stealing a day lazy... This feeling you know? You can get strength without any effort like you. People can understand how difficult it is for me! The more I practice healing, the more I feel my aging. When I finally have the power, I realize that I have lost my youth and enthusiasm. You may realize that a genius like you can understand how to look back and discover the sorrow and pain that youth is no longer! When someone tells me that I can regain my youth, how can you not tempted me!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elna, you are a genius! When you are 12 years old, you will perform resurrection. When you are twelve years old, you can summon the goddess to your body. You can know my feelings. Do you understand my feelings when you look at the power of the little hairs that I have dreamed of, and pay for my life? You can understand!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..."<br /><br />&nb Sp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I am jealous! But how do you call me! I faked the rumor that you have the demon's blood, it is me! But I regard this rumor as true, because this can make I am a little better!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You said this is a rumor you made?" Elna slowly recovered and began to stand up. The healing on her body worked, and the damage just disappeared slowly. "So, my lineage..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are a personal class! Your mother and your foster mother are all watching me grow up! Your mother is innocent love The last knight to come here to heal! But the man did not say goodbye after you have it... When your mother gave birth to you, it was difficult to give birth. She summoned the goddess before she died, and you were born when the goddess came! You are the daughter of the goddess of life, the goddess of Leica gave birth to you! The symbol on your body is exactly the same as that on the guardian's robe. You are the one who is blessed by her!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"What!" Elna stunned and listened to these words. The law has no longer been calm and steady in the past, so that he looks like a fierce beast in this darkness, and it is full of dangerous atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So you..." Erna stuttered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I accepted the request of the Sayādaw, poisoned the big priest with poison, and used the resources of the temple to help the Reiter empire! To this he told me The way to restore youth! The magic array has been completed, as long as a few days, right, only a few days, when the orbit of the stars shifts to a special position, this magic can be launched, I can be younger! I Waiting for this day for too long, taking such a big risk, no one can stop me now! You are the same!" In an instant, the body of the law became a residual image, when Elna responded, he The fist has hit Erna. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah..." A heavy punch was accompanied by a broken bone, and the fist of the Fashen hit the heart. The huge impact made Elna's heart stop working, her body hung on her fist, and then softly smashed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "End!" With the fall of Elna, the law tells me that everything is over. Before the ritual began, before the abnormality of the priest was discovered, he became another person and disappeared. No one recognized him in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned and left the place. Those guys were not afraid. In the temple, before the death of the big priest was discovered, he was absolutely authoritative, and those guys could not escape. As long as you lock the door, the rest is only a matter of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the bully girl very happy?" A voice suddenly rang, and the law turned and turned and saw Elna standing up again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Impossible, just..." This punch was a deadly attack, and no one could live under that kind of blow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of the female therapist begins to shine, no, not that she is shining, but something that glows on her. The law is in surprise and reminds everyone of this tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Big...big...big priest?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I finally recognized it. "Irna puts out the fighting posture and speaks in a very relaxed tone. "Children fight is over, now it is a contest for adults!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician stumbled and ran, his feet were always sloppy, and he ran high and lowered his foot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are twenty more magicians who follow the story, and basically the grade of the great magician. There is probably not much chance of winning. Running is the best option, you can't use flying, it is simply to give the enemy a target. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that is strange is how the big magicians attack with some ordinary magic, maybe just a tentative nature. After all, there are two of them in the middle of the pedestrian wearing a robe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about other people?" Kim stopped and asked Behan around him. There is no sound in the back now, probably the enemy has chased it from other channels. At the moment, Kim found that Old Locke and Babe and Lev did not stay with them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Running!" Behan answered. He also stopped and began to gasp. Except for Wei, the other two people are tired enough, but they finally get rid of the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Continue!" The magician set his mind. Old Locke said that these roads lead to the same place, as long as you grasp the direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three men ran forward, the enemy probably lost, and did not encounter other troubles along the way, and smoothly ran up along a slope. After opening a slate, four people found that they were back on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have they seen our face just now?" Lev suddenly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There should be no..." Behan answered that he had never been in contact with them during the entire chase. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They saw me!" Wei followed and replied that although it was only a small contact, the other party should recognize him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In any case, first go and get the weapon!" Behan waved, and anyone who wants to fight with the empty hand and the boxing fighter certainly has no good results. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait a minute, we should leave a person to wait for other people!" Kim thought for a moment. "I will stay!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you are alone..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reassure I will take care of myself!" The magician answered with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Be careful, we will be back soon!" said, the two men left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden down, he knows what to do, first of all, first add a "perceived eye" to the slate to let himself know whether it is close to the enemy or friend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...With the insight into the eyes of all things, I borrowed power from me..." The magic was done very quickly, but it was a bit strange, and it was not finished. Complex magic seems to consume a lot of magic - but this may be the illusion caused by running tired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay!" Kim stood up and can now rest assured that no matter who wants to come out of it, he will know first. Kim looked up and looked around the room. This is the front hall. The place where he is located is obviously the place to arrange the wounded, but it is empty now...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A figure wearing a white mage robe entered the room at this time and looked at gold with a vicious smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bright?" Kim stepped back and looked at him with surprise. How did he come? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kim waved his cane and hit the door of Bright, interrupting his proud speech. He knows that there is no chance to win with Bright's face-to-face magic. The last magic war has proved this. With the help of His Holiness, Brett has acquired a magic that is far stronger than him - but now it is a battle, not a magic test, any means, as long as it can win, it must be adopted! Fighting with a magician doesn't require magic to win, and the last unilateral beating with Liz has taught Kim. He and Brett have competed three times, and the two wins were all obtained with fists. Now Kim is going to carry forward this glorious tradition again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Jin Chong, Brightt quickly recited the curse, but it was too late, and when the fist hit his face, the spell was interrupted at the same time. No one can recite spells and cast magic while squatting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last battle with Liz was repeated again, but this time the victim became Bright. He kept chanting spells and was interrupted and read, but nothing could be obtained except for more fists. He is too big. If he is faced with a warrior, he will come to a defensive magic and then speak loudly, but he did not expect Jin to use this trick directly. The battle was completely overwhelming, and Kim was dripping his hand as a sandbag to practice his fist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heavy one foot in the chest of the law, hitting his entire body Fly out and hit a complete wall that is still preserved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no hope..." Despair, like the plague, has filled the whole heart of the law, and fighting with the big priest is no chance of victory. Ouni's boxing skill is unknown in the temple. Although she is five years younger than Fas, she has always been a winner in all past discussions before she became a priest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The law stood up and made a splash, but when the opponent retreated, he took the opportunity to jump over the wreck and disappear into his enemy. In the eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, escape!" Erna, no, the big priest O'Neill said slightly disappointed. "It's rare to have an opportunity for an event..." Since the boss's sacrifice, this opportunity has not existed, and at most I can only practice with Erna. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Forget it, forget it, with the help of this child's body, I also become like a child..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The law spreads on the chest, running fast, his speed does not look like he can have at this age. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Abominable! The big priest is still alive, and can do this! No wonder her body has not changed for half a year, neither rot nor dry. ... can actually attach Elna's body!... How can I stop this position? I want to..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A small figure suddenly stops On the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The law stopped and looked at the little girl in front of him and immediately recognized the girl as one of the group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My name is Babe." Babe smiles at Mimi. Speaking of it, "You are so funny, you only have to bully and weaken. If you see the strong, you will only run. It is really useless. Is this also suitable for others?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The anger suddenly rushed to the brain of the law. If it was normal, he would have to look carefully because of the girl’s performance, this is a fearless attitude, but the frustration is full of mind and body, he is not aware Out of danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You stinky!" The law scattered a pair of babe, his face full of embarrassment. "Dare to laugh at me, so young is going to die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are doing this to me, you are not too young to die!" Babe's smile remains unchanged. But the face of the law is grayed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s so cold..." He wanted to let go, but his hand didn’t listen. "This...this is the power of Pluto, the power of death...in the How is the sacred place possible..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Life and death are the opposite poles! There is nothing strange about the emissary of Pluto in the Temple of the Goddess of Life... ...or, people like you, don’t understand..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...everything is decayed and degraded, and it belongs to the dust!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of the law is collapsed and collapsed into countless tiny pieces, like sand sculptures. The strong wind blows completely off. Just then, his whole person disappeared from the world, leaving no trace at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay," Babe clap his hands, then teased the baby with his fingers, which sounded awkwardly. "The trouble has been solved..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She turned and left, it seems that she did not see the old Locke in front of him. The latter did not know when it appeared and saw her entire process of dealing with the law. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello, out of life and death!" When he walked past the old Locke, Babe said so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello, the master of death!" Old Locke replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wake up! Wake up!" With this voice, Lev slowly Woke up from a coma. There is Elna's face in front of me, but that face seems to be shining...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! Lev opened his eyes fiercely and remembered coming back into his mind. He was in the process of running with the old man. He didn't think that the old man was so powerful, he didn't even have the chance to dodge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Alna, you're okay!" Lev grabbed Elna's hand, but then he found it wrong. Elna is shining all the time – just like the last time in the desert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah..." Lev couldn't help but step back and look at the man who borrowed the body of Elna. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh... don't be so scared!" Elna's face showed a smile, the kind of laughter that felt fun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You... are you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's it, I am using it now The child's body talks to you! Simply put, I want to ask you, do you like this child?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is so straightforward that Lev can't help but feel awkward I can't answer it for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right... It should be explained, my name is O'Neill, in the ordinary way, I am the mother of Elna - although she is not my own Rest assured, my mouth is very strict and will not be revealed - and even if it is revealed, it doesn't matter!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, Lev recovered from the horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You...you are the big priest of the temple?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, leave this alone I asked you, do you like Elna? Do you want to marry her?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes..." Although this is said in a state of horror But it is not a lie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So then you listen. First of all, you can't bully Elna in the future - but you can't seem to bully her either... this one doesn't count. First, You have to give up your current career, you can't continue to be an adventurer, I can't allow Elna to live a wandering life in the future. Second, you must throw away your weapons and leather armor and learn how to use healing. Well, I have to mix it with the primary therapist, otherwise how can I live in the temple for a long time! Third... Third... I haven’t thought about it yet, I will say it later! Do you agree?”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lev was simply stunned by this fierce attack. I didn’t think of the priest of the temple, and the foster mother of Elna would suddenly come up with this kind of thing – in some ways O'Neill is very childish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you promised? If you don't talk, I will promise you! Get up!" O'Neill stood up, but Lev was not confused because it was still messy. action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ouni reached out and pulled Leif to the whole. She looked at Lev and looked dull, suddenly holding his head and lips on Lev's unprepared lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't mind, this is Elna's kiss! You should be happy! Hahahaha... Oh, young is so good... Ok, don't play, now come with me!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jin Yiquan followed a punch, and soon, Bright knew that he had no hope of victory. It is. He struggled, but he couldn't resist the strength of Kim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No..." He finally screamed, but Kim was not merciless, and he slammed the last punch to knock him down to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright is now lying on the ground like a fur-dog, and the white magician gown is now full of red dots. His face is even more terrible, and he is beaten by gold. The battle is over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold wiped the sweat from his face and let out a sigh of relief. It was quiet all around, but it was so fierce that it was not moving at all. It seems that there are no people nearby. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do it well, do it well!" A frog sounding like a box inside sounded, "It’s amazing to beat Blett!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who?" Kim looked around, but the sound seemed to be coming out of the wall and could not grasp the source. He looked down and found that Bright had disappeared. There was a sound coming from behind, and the magician turned and saw a body in armor holding Brett. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body armor of this person is more thorough than Wei, Wei also reveals some joints to facilitate activities, but this person is wrapped in all but one pair of eyes. In the armor. And the armor on his body doesn't look like a human craft - the style is different from any armor the wizard has ever seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gold!" A voice came, and Behan and Wei came back. "Run, there are too many therapists..." They saw this steel geek at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are you?" Seeing this apparently unintentional geek, two people are on either side of the gold, pointing their swords at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reassured, this time I am not your enemy...hehe!" The figure of steel slowly disappeared, gradually becoming transparent like a phantom, including his hands. Hold Bright. But what is strange is that the sound does not seem to come from the iron can. The familiar voice, when Kim also reacted, the Wei had already known who the sound he would never forget would belong to. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Eight Eyes Devil!" Wei Yisheng violently slammed into the past, but his sword was a little late, and the figure had completely disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The best!" A very loud voice came, and the three turned and saw a large group of angry therapists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is a ban on the ban of the temple, and this sacred place!" The therapists have surrounded them. They are more familiar with the environment than the gold ones, and the white robe appears in every exit, completely encircling them. Unless they kill a bloody road, this time they really can't escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three men are on the verge of fear, and the slate has suddenly been uncovered - because of this intense activity, Kim has lost the eye of perception. Control - two more people climbed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing!" Elna asked loudly. The eccentric sound is not like the usual Erna, but with this voice, all the therapists present are calmed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How to change so murderous!" Erna made a second speech. Now everyone notices the abnormality of Erna, her body is shining, strong but soft light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Big...big priest..." I don't know who called, now almost all the therapists think of this for more than a year for various reasons. There is no sound that appears in the public. The big priest has always been known for not wanting to do things, so even if it doesn't appear for more than a year, there are not many people who are suspicious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Listen, the first auxiliary sacrifice betrayed the temple!" O'Neill said loudly, "he used poison to murder me and me, and then borrowed my orders. Deceive everyone! But fortunately there is a goddess bless, I am not dead, but I can only attach to my daughter now!" She cleared her throat, "Now I am abolishing the position of the law, his orders are invalid!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright opened his eyes. Entering the field of vision is a dark rock, he is now in a cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright turned and sat up, and the memory slowly recovered in the mind. "Yes, my face!" He reached out and touched his own. Unrecognizable face, but at the moment there is no feeling on the face. When he was in a coma, his wounds were completely cured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright now begins to watch the surroundings, and then he finds that a man wrapped in steel is standing not far from him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello..." After a silence, Brett spoke first. In the vague fuzzy memory in the brain, it seems that this man saved him from the cow. Anyway, he has to express his gratitude a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man did not move, just like the stone did not respond to his words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello." Brette walked up to the stranger and thanked him again, but the other party still had no reaction. The only exposed scorpion is unremarkable, or there is no life at all. This eye is definitely not a living person. It can only belong to a statue or a corpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brightte gently pushed the other side in surprise, the body fell immediately, and the armor hit the rock and made a loud sound. This guy is only standing in a very delicate balance, with a little bit of external force, he is like a dummy made of bricks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright was surprised and then retired, and then the voice coming from behind him turned his head and saw that the Sayādaw appeared behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You woke up?Bright!" The voice of the Sayādaw was as usual, or a frog called inside the box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Supreme..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demon extended a hand and made a gesture, Then Brett saw that the fallen iron shovel stood up quickly and restored the posture of standing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are very lucky!" The sorcerer laughed, but the weird voice made it impossible to hear the irony. "I just arrived! You were beaten to death by your classmate with your fist."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's because..." Brett retorted angrily, but his words were interrupted by His Holiness. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But it’s good, if you kill him, my plan will be gone!...hahahaha"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright quietly listened to the other person's smirk, but the fear in my heart was deeper. The demon made him unable to see through. He didn't know what the Lord wanted or what he wanted to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, let's do something right." The laughter of the Sayādaw stopped and returned to normal. Now, Brett can feel the unstoppable joy in his voice, and he never hears this strong joy from the sound of this demon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“正事?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Yes...Go to our distinguished Victor’s Majesty "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When two people appear in the emperor’s bedroom, time has passed Near the early morning. The walls of the emperor's bedroom were covered with thick curtains and curtains, but they were very bright. The light source came from the gem that he was holding in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor is admiring this artifact that he watches every day, perhaps since his son’s death, this gem has become his greatest comfort. Therefore, the attraction and control of the gemstone to him is deeper and stronger than the average person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Supreme?Bright?" The emperor discovered these two sudden appearances. He quickly hid the gems to his side. "What are you doing?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want a thing!" Sayādaw said slowly and at the same time bent over a little salute, but his eyes were staring at this enthusiasm and style. The emperor in the same day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The contract of the dragon?" Victor's expression began as if he had been stabbed in front of the person, but he immediately returned his face to normal - unfortunately this obvious change was even concealed by the cloth. "No such "Things!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? Then, let me say goodbye!" The Sayādaw bent again, and there was no killing in his voice, but When he straightened up, the emperor's body had already rolled out of bed and fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have no use, just like the law!" The sage said coldly, and the voice made Bleed shudder. The demon took out a book from under his huge black robe and opened it. Now it can be seen that this is the magic book that falls in his hand - the Sayādaw looks at it inside, and the hand draws a complicated symbol in the air at the same time. In a very short time, a magical array Appeared in this room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What I want can be read directly from your brain! And I want you to do it, it is no longer necessary! Hahahahahahahaha "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ugly laughter echoed in this room, and Brett flinched in the corner, watching the scene he had never thought of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therapists pull up the weak sergeant's body and let her sit Facing these few guests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, I am sorry, this is the only way, my body can't move!" O'Neill smiled and faced the five people - Old Locke And Babe did not know where to go, and found it for two days. Her tone is very relaxed, but the five people in front of me know that the big priest is poisonous, so it has been almost dying for a year - not to eat or drink for a year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I really didn't think that the law was so embarrassing! I actually put the venom on my clothes, so that my body is constantly corroded, even if treated It’s not a good thing! But it’s right, he’s also a therapist. Of course, I know that the common method of poisoning is that the medicine doesn’t fall for me!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What do you ask us to order?" Gold carefully opened the mouth. Yesterday, the priestly possession revealed all the conspiracy on Elna. Then the therapists opened the door, replaced her with poisonous clothes, and helped her neutralize the toxins. But after one night, the body still can't talk about recovery, and the big priest is anxious to see them. In the face of such a person with status, the magician is a little scared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What command? Ah..." The priest was slightly surprised, and then began to giggling. "There is nothing to tell, just want to look at you with your own eyes. I use the power of the goddess to make my body rigid, not completely corroded by poison, but this makes me only boring to lie down. So I will connect my will and Elna so that I can do something more! So I know a few of you. Now I want to take a look! Just like this!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Connected with Will and Elna..." Kim shouted, it was an incredible thing, never heard of any magic - the therapist said strictly A branch of the magician - that can be done that way. And how is it possible not only to connect but also to manipulate the body of Elna? But the truth is in front of you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah...Mom, then why don’t you just attach it to someone in the shrine, let the teacher of the law... the plan of the law can’t be won?” Erna raised a new question<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So what's so fun? The temple is so boring, but as a big priest I can't go out! Not as good as See what you want to do in the end! And you can also see if Elna has met someone who is not good..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mom!" Elna loudly Interrupted the words of the foster mother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cheat-you--!" O'Neill laughed, though she was underpowered because of her weakness. "...I don't want to, can't! I can only build this spiritual connection with you, Elna. Because we are mothers and daughters, only daughters can understand that the mother reaches the heart... Hehehehe..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are a little embarrassed to see each other, and the performance of Erna’s mother is beyond the expectations of any one of them - although this cannot be said bad, but ... always feel a little weird. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four pairs of skeptical eyes suddenly fell to the unprepared Lev, and his face was suddenly red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five people walked out of the room of the big priest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where did Beibei go?" In order to shift the topic, he immediately mentioned this fact. There is nothing missing from the old Locke. He hasn't known how many times he used it, but Babe, the little girl, can't find it all at once? The ruins of the underground that were only known to a few people are now open, and the therapists have been looking for many times, but they can't find them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in fact, everyone is not very worried, after all, there is old Locke, it is likely that he took the little girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you feel strange?" Wei suddenly spoke. "Bebe's appearance is incredible, and there seems to be some change in her body!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No!" Behan recalled the little girl, but I feel as if I used to. Moreover, except that she suddenly appeared a little strange - this is almost the same as her last meeting with them - nothing changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is some kind of power in guarding her!" Wei said, this is his instinctive feeling, just as the beast sees other animals instinctively knows that Prey is still a strong enemy, even if it has never been seen before. Wei instinct felt dangerous from Babe, although this feeling was very weak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't see it!" Kim also replied. Babe feels the same as last time, but the baby is a bit weird. Last time I remembered that the baby liked the things that glowed very much, but this time I saw that the glowing gems in the hands of the old Locke did not react. But this may also be because it grows up a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are no longer talking. Everyone walked the rest of the road in silence and went back to their respective rooms. Now is the last time. After leaving the temple, they are no longer a group, and they are moving in their respective directions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alna out of their room. Tonight, there was some kind of power in the darkness and something lurking in the depths of her blood calling each other, so that she could not sleep at all. After the failure to let her sleep come, she simply climbed up and walked outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alna is free to stroll through the shrine, and unconsciously, she has stepped out of the door of the temple. The two guards at the door have been removed, leaving only one stone on the road telling the insiders that they cannot carry any weapons with spikes and sharp edges. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She walked away from the long steps. Below is a small square with the new lady statue in the middle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Erna Sister!" A voice came from above. Elna looked up and saw Babe's figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moonlight sprinkled from the top of Babe’s head, making her black short hair reflect some blue luster. Her white skin looks more meticulous now, and the childish face is now without the childishness that this age should have, but with the charm of a mature woman. At this moment, Babe is like a detached elf of this world, exudes indescribable beauty, which is a temptation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Babe? You..." Erna clearly felt that the babe at the moment was different. She had something different from the past, but This is purely a feeling, an indescribable feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's me!" Babe smiled sweetly and then jumped off the tall statue. Her body fell like a butterfly. Gorgeous and light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How are you here?" Erna asked, but she took a step back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am looking for the other half!" Babe said, "But now I believe that you are!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The other half? What do you mean by this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The power that might break the existing balance of the world has emerged, in order to sustain life. And death, that is, the most basic balance in the world, life and death must strengthen their own strength at the same time, this is my purpose here!" Babe said to her, her face keeps that sweet The smile was not there, but Erna took another step in her gaze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sister Elna, you must use all the power now - otherwise you will die!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black shadows are emitted from Babe's body, She was surrounded by Elna before she escaped. The power of death rushed up and ruthlessly caught the body of the therapist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a darkness around, no up and down, as if in the bottomless abyss Keep falling. The whole body is imaginary, not feeling what is outside the body, nor feeling what is inside the body, only a piece of nothingness, complete nothingness. But there is power in this emptiness, constantly squeezing the body, pressure, pressure, or pressure that cannot be determined even if there is a existence, as if to explode the body, but I don’t know what else the empty body has. Maintain, why should we maintain... this is death! Everything falls into the pulse of the whole, erases the traces of the existence of the individual, and does not leave anything...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, you can't end it. Suddenly a voice was raised in my heart. In an instant, the body is no longer empty, full of power! The power broke out and began to fill the void of the void, and it kept spurting out. It seemed to fill the whole emptiness and prove its existence to the whole! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feeling faded, Elna found herself lying on the ground, Big mouth gasping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, sister Elna, you are doing very well! My judgment is correct, you are indeed the other half!" Babe’s voice When it sounded, Elna barely looked up and looked at Babe's face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You...in the end..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am Babe, now is Pluto The messenger, just like you are the messenger of Leica! Sister Elna!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What the hell are you talking about?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The era of chaos has arrived!" Babe looked at Elna's face, and the smile did not change. "There are a lot of wars, killings, deaths... So I and you will be there! Our existence is to maintain this, so as not to lose control! Pluto has chosen me, Leica has chosen you... it's that simple!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bebei’s feet appeared a circle of glowing text, and her body disappeared into the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, sister Elna, don't get involved in unrelated disputes... If you break the balance, then I can only reverse this balance again... if that's the case We will not be happy!" Babe disappeared from the face of Elna, only this last sentence floated in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great Festival has finally begun. The temple has long blocked the news, and no outsiders know the changes that have taken place inside the temple. Everyone only knows that the big priests appear as they used to be, and then, with holy water, sprinkle them to the crowd to bless them. The patient or the wounded are treated free of charge, the heavy patient is taken to the temple, and the light is treated at the market. People are crowded, cheering, and everything is the same as in previous years, without any ominous signs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day is all over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four people walked back to the temple with a smile, and today they participated in the entire ceremonies, which is a good for anyone who has not participated in the past. Unforgettable scenes. On the other hand, they also tried their best to make themselves happy. After all, this is the last day of their together. Tomorrow, Behan and Kim will go home, and Lev intends to stay here. Wei will continue his travel. In short, he will break up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four went to the inner temple. Da Si Festival informed them in the morning and asked them to come to her room to meet her after the ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone thought that this was just another common meeting - or a ritual intended to expel the curse for Wei. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They came to the door and there was a burst of sound, it seemed that the big priest was talking to whom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can only believe so! Big priest - I told you, he has been selected, this is inescapable..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, the conversation inside did not seem to end, so Behan knocked on the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come in!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behan opened the door and saw that the old Locke was sitting on the big Opposite the priest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Introduction," looked at the four people astonished, and O'Neill clearly misunderstood. "This is Mr. Gilles, he is the leader of the Adventurers' Union." People!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rock...sir..." The four men stared at the old man and his new identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Locke turned his face, his face is now without any trace of hippie smile, but a serious face, and full of anxiety! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We have known each other!" Old Locke said to the priest, "There is no need to introduce it!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are you?" Lev couldn't help but ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Old Locke, Gilles, or any other name... The name doesn't mean much to me!" Old Locke whispered, "I am here." I want you to complete a task!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four people all looked at the old man in front of him, although he had guessed that he was definitely not an ordinary person. I did not expect him to be the mysterious leader of the adventurer's union! Every adventurer believes that the existence of the adventurer's union must have the support behind it. There must be a strong man who is in control of everything - although he never shows up - but he did not think that the leader behind this organization is actually a The roadside relies on the old man who sympathizes with the lover of drinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Things are dangerous, I don't have time to explain them carefully. I just want to tell you two things. First, the half-orcs and dwarves are now attacking the ice and snow. The City - the capital of Dick, the place we met for the first time, they have been surrounded by the city for half a month..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a minute, How did they appear, I mean, those fortress cities in the north of Deco? For example, Hope?” Behan asked, the news was incredible. Maybe they can raid through the tunnel, but the siege is really unbelievable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It was compromised a month ago!" Old Locke used his hands to take off his chin, unable to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But this is impossible!" Such a strong city wall, how could it be like this as a mustard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We all underestimated the power of the dwarf!" Old Locke said, "Their strength is much stronger than imagined..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But are we not already helping the dwarves to win their artifacts? Why do they continue to fight?" the magician asked aloud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Locke looked at Kim’s eyes, his face was very serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, we haven't been able to recapture the jewels..." he said slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Locke made a gesture that interrupted Kim. "That night, I didn't say goodbye, but was defeated and driven away... Although I almost succeeded, I still didn't get the artifact! The sage, or you are called the Eight-Eyed Devil, was also The high goblins are called the blue nightmare - he suddenly appears, blocking my plan... I am barely able to escape."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don’t say what has passed, it’s already irreparable. The key now is not the huge coalition of half-orcs and dwarves, another thing. Old Locke added a tone to let everyone know how important he is about to announce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But what does this have to do with it?" Lev couldn't help but ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the ruins, the last human and dragon contract was kept." Old Locke replied, "And my intelligence tells me that it is called Bulai. Special - Kim, your former classmate - and an unusually tall man wrapped in a black cloak, have already entered!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Dragon's contract? But..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Listen, young people, you don't understand what it means! If we can get help from the dragons, then don't say It’s a half-orc and a dwarf. Even with the Wings, the High Fairy, the Lizard, the Forest Alliance, and the Necromancers forming the anti-human alliance, we can still fight! But if the Covenant falls into the hands of our enemies You don't need other enemies to work hard, the dragons can completely destroy the human power."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold surprised to listen - everyone is equally astonished Listening - although I know that the dragon is very strong, but... no Locke put it exaggerated it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The dragons have been living in Long Island for many years, and with few exceptions, there has been no much connection with other races... so many years Come, they have been studying humans, learning everything we have created... Now their power is strong enough that no one can imagine... If someone uses the contract with the dragon to let the dragon attack humans, we even Resist can't do it... Our weapons don't hurt them flying in the sky, our magic can't fight their vindictiveness..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But that's The contract between humans and dragons - can't be used to harm humans themselves?" Behan said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are wrong, young man, that contract only requires the dragon to obey the contractor, whether he is human or not. Simply put, if the sage gets the one In the case of a contract, I think his purpose has been reached."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sir? Wait a minute, you say Sayādaw?" The magician immediately remembered the past, Especially the conversation that was heard outside the room in Long Island and the French room. "You mean... everything..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I have reason to believe that everything is driving behind him! The half-orc re-emerges, they The alliance with the dwarves, and the great victory of Mazro of the Reiter empire, the necromancers re-find their artifacts... all of this can only sum up a trajectory, that is, he tries to weaken humans and through a big war. Completely subvert the status of mankind..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What the hell is he for?" Lev shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know...but I know I have to get the contract first! So I need you - I hope you can accomplish this task! If you get it before you get it - you can't kill it - the dragon's contract."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why are you looking for us?" After a while, Kim first opened his mouth. Although Kim is not a stubborn person, what Old Locke just told him is...like a myth. Inexplicably, a mission to save humanity falls on the hands of the adventurers who are planning to disband themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't have time to find someone else... a group of powerful and reliable warriors. If there is enough time, maybe I will find a way to get a team more suitable... ...but now it’s only for you. And...” Old Locke’s eyes are concentrated on Kim’s body. “You are much stronger than you know. What I see from you is unlimited potential, especially It’s you, Kim, you’re still a cursed mage!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Locke looked at their eyes and made Kim feel a little uneasy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Would you like me to fight with the Eight-Eyed Devil?" Wei opened his mouth for the first time, and his voice was so low that several others were shocked. "I am going!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a minute, Wei, this is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Even if there is no chance of victory, I have to go!" Wei clenched his hands and looked at the old Locke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is a chance!" Old Locke faced Wei, "but very embarrassed..." He looked at Wei’s original position where the sword was destroyed. "I have a thing that can play the power of the Demon Sword... but it can only be used once, and it is very dangerous!" With the words, the old Locke took out a transparent crystal block from his pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei took the weird thing from the old Locke, although it was only a little, but Kim recognized that it was actually a large storage crystal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is... the magic crystal?" Kim looked at him with surprise, never heard of the thing that shattered the magic crystal, but the old Locke It’s not like lying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Old Locke turned his head and looked at Kim. "There is a madness that overlaps twenty times... It’s only a moment of heart. There is still hatred for nearby people. Originally this is the darkness of the attacking magic, which can make a person immediately mad and even die. But only this can inspire enough hatred to drive the power of the demon sword!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is also the only way I can come up with the real power of fangs!" Old Lockton paused and said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can you do this!" Kim suddenly found his voice full of anger, and the image of the old Locke suddenly changed. This is simply murder! Over 20 madness! Can humans bear such powerful dark magic? If Wei really uses this thing, he will die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I only give this thing to him, use it is not his right!" Old Locke greeted Kim's line of sight, his face remained the same. "This is only the last helpless means to use in the worst case!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am going!" Wei said once again, without any sound in the voice. Hesitant and shaken, it seems that he is ironic. Although this is almost a gamble with no chance of winning, it is much better than the desperation of the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Young people," Old Locke is now looking at other people, including Elna. "You can choose to go or not, even when you are there, you can leave at any time. No one will blame you for this, because the power of the blue nightmare is more than the imagination of any one of you - even can say There is no thing in the world that can defeat him," he glanced at Wei. "If there is no magic sword."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone exchanged a look at each other And then made a decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others walked out of the room, leaving only the old Locke and O'Neill . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Gilles, have you just told me that I only ask the help of the warrior and the magician?" The big priest stood up, "even if you add that The swordsman will forget, how can I even go to Erna and Lev? What can a thief do on top of what? What does Erna do, to treat? Or use her bad boxing to fight?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Please don't be excited, big priest." Old Locke also stood up. "As I said, the group of young people can opt out at any time, I will never stop... this is their own choice!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" ..." The big priest bowed his head and silenced, then he raised his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How can the god of nothing choose the child...he... can he do what you say?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He will grow, failure and pain can make people grow!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gold, are you there?" Old Locke tapped the door lightly, then heard the footsteps, and the door was opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What, Mr. Locke?" Kim’s face didn’t have any sleepiness, it seemed that he didn’t sleep at all—others should be similar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am going to give you something, although it may be too early for you, but now it is already a chance." With the words, Old Locke Take a small ingot from the body, very small, only the size of the nail, in this light can hardly see clearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is called memory crystal...one can't Use common sense to explain things." Old Locke replied. He has entered the room and sat down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hold it, then concentrate, imagine your thoughts passed into it by hand!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold according to the instructions of the old Locke, suddenly, What other areas are connected with his thoughts. It was a messy feeling, just like a person who was used to the darkness was suddenly thrown into a place with strong sunlight. Something is communicating with his thoughts, not through any senses, just direct contact, just like the teachings of the elders of the dragon. But that time was the idea that the whole idea was dissolved into the elders of the dragon, and this time it was this alien field that invaded one's own thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contact was suddenly interrupted. The magician opened his eyes and found that he still had a memory crystal in his hand. The experience was just like a dream, no, not a dream, it was true,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because Kim suddenly found out that he knew something that he had just known. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Locke?" The magician asked in surprise, and the old Locke just nodded slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know?" Old Locke said slowly, "Forbidden Curse..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Yes!" Kim was a little confused, but this is the reality. Just now, he suddenly found himself knowing a lot of curses that he didn't know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the curse created by mankind." Old Locke said slowly, "wind strikes, thunder bounds, earth curses, ground fires... ...and the most terrible inflammation of eternal catastrophe... It takes a lot of time to learn to remember, so now I can only use this method." He stood up, went to the gold, and took the magical piece from the gold hand. Memory crystal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have to remember, Kim," Old Locke said to Kim before going out the door. "The reason why the curse is called a curse is because of its horrible power." And unpredictable results... You must understand that even if you are a curse of the Master, you can't underestimate its power. Otherwise, it will bury yourself... Do you understand?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher! "A body suddenly appeared in the darkness, blocking the way of the old Locke." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is you, Nubis? Is there anything? Right, has my business been completed?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's done, mentor!" The necromancer swears. In the dark, his appearance does not seem to be any different from ordinary people. "But why do you want to give that power to the young man? He is still far from mature, and it is impossible to control the power freely. Is it appropriate to give him such dangerous power? In case he loses control... he can cause A terrible destruction!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you think I have a choice?" Old Locke's face showed a bitter expression. "Of course I know that he is not suitable for this power now...this may ruin him, but..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it..." The Necromancer said Half sentence, and then received it back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, you can't, Nobis." Old Locke lowered his voice. "You are really strong, but you belong to order...the power of order." It is impossible to destroy chaos... It can only destroy chaos, only chaos!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the other room, Elna ushered in the guest when almost gold was lying back in bed trying to fall asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mom? How come you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tomorrow you can't go!" The priest went straight into the knife and there was no room for manoeuvre. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you talking about, Mom!" asked Erna in surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I said you can't go to that site, your adventure game is over, stay in the temple!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
