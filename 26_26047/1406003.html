			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 01<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kingdom of Chirila is on the south side of the lost continent and is also the territory of human control The southernmost point. Although this country is a kingdom and has a central government, the power of the central government is weak. It is better to say that it is a loose alliance than a kingdom. Although the local official is nominally appointed by the central government, it is actually hereditary, but only gets a central name. The north side is still fine. At least it is still very respectful to the king in name, surrendering to this country, but the south has become a complete three-way zone. Centering on Tito, the largest city in the south, it is 15 cities in size and covers an area of ​​over 17,000 square kilometers. It is an absolutely anarchic area where everything is legal, full of desperate and risky adventurers. As everyone knows, the adventurer's profession is a typical mix of daring, daring and loyal, and those who have no idea what morality is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city closest to Undead Island in the south is called Demerin. This place is said to be in the place of the Undead Wars, where the Undead Legion landed, and in the General Assembly After the fiasco fled back to Undead Island, humans built a military base in this place to monitor the necromancers. This is the origin of all the cities in this area, but this is already insignificant for the people who live here. No one cares about the past, and for them, continuing to live is the most important thing. Complete disorder and complete freedom at the same time, as long as you have power, everything is ok, while some people are eager for order, while others enjoy this life very much. One of the people, Czechoslovakia, the owner of the "Fish and Wine" pub in the south of De Merlin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Czechon is not a local person here, no one knows where he is from, but then, in this place, no one has the heart to ask a person. In the past, since he came here, he got it, and what happened in the past. Czechosloved came here more than a decade ago and married the daughter of the tavern owner. After his death, he became the new owner of the pub. The local person gave him a nickname "red nose", mainly because his red and big nose is very easy to impress. Generally speaking, there are few people who have seen him. Forget about this feature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hotel of the Czechoslovakia boss is a relatively quiet place, that is to say, people who drink here always go outside when they want to move the knife. Less in the store directly, in addition to the hotel's people are better, the boss as a powerful summoner is also an important reason, when the Czech Republic summoned the terrible World of Warcraft to stop the chaos in the store His wife favored him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very ordinary morning, while Czecho is doing a dishwashing with one of his old clients, Parker, who works in the adventurer’s union. Gossip. There are very few guests in the morning, the most idle time of the day, and this situation will not change until noon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey! Parker!" The boss was busy with his hands while talking to the tall, thin middle-aged man who was drinking. "Is there anything late?" Big things! I mean, those things that deserve attention!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is not much new stock, the only thing is the war between the Red Alliance and the Reiter Empire. The Victor Emperor of Reiter mobilized 200,000 troops this time and launched a large-scale attack on the Red Alliance. Now he has come to the Mazalah plain in the Red Alliance. The Alliance is also ready to meet. It seems that a big battle is not possible. Avoid it! This time I estimate that at least 200,000 people will die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Will you die 200,000? I can’t stop, see the momentum of the Leite Empire汹汹Looks like this, it seems to be playing really, maybe the Red League will be swallowed up or not! If so, only 200,000 people will die too!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Two people are discussing the results of the war in the most dull tone, as if they were killed 200,000 people It is commonplace. This shows that people in this area are contemptuous of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, is there anything new in the city?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"H, you I even asked me this, the city thing, you hotel owner knows more than me! This sentence should be I ask you! You have to know, I spent the whole day in the brothel yesterday, I don’t know anything. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know very little, it seems that there was a small dispute in the South Gate yesterday, and I have died for ten people. Besides, there is nothing. It’s a thing, this spring seems to have been very calm!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get it! That kind of thing is not there every year! Right, have you heard of one thing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I heard a person say that several adventurers arrived here on the dragon! Riding the dragon! Not only that, the composition of the team is very strange, even children and women There are!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'm interested, I really want to see it for myself!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss stopped The work on hand, adding a glass of wine to his old guests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is especially for you! You can't come tomorrow! Count it as a compensation!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"???"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You forgot, tomorrow is the 'that' day!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right right! Look, I almost forgot! If you remind me, I really forgot 'that'! It's no wonder that these days have calmed down!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door suddenly heard the sound of pushing the door. A figure wearing a metal armor walked into the empty pub, from the way he pushed the door and walked. Look, his current mood is really not very good! The man swept his eyes around the scene and walked straight to the counter to sit down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's the point?" The boss looked carefully at the young man in front. This person has never seen it, it should be new. Like other young people who are fledgling, he wears a heavy body armor, which is stupid to show off his strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A glass of ale!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drinking spirits early in the morning? Although I feel that this person is a bit strange, but the hotel owner does not have to take care of this business, as long as he can pay, when he drinks what wine! The red nose boss poured a full glass of ale into front of the young guest. The scent of wine is enough to prove that the wine of the Czech boss is not a fake fake, but a bit of a level of brewing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was pushed away again by force, and several people inside it were looking out. This is where there are twenty people, one by one. Armed, with a look of disappointment on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The trouble is coming!" The red nose boss greeted him, although he knew that this could not escape, but he did not expect to come so fast! "Everyone! Please sit!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's come this one!" The leader took the slightest. "Red nose, do you want to know clearly? We have warned you! If you don't give money, don't want to open a door to do business here!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" However, I have already paid for Tylo..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is ours, this site is ours, you don't think if you don't pay protection fees." Do business!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bad boy!" The red-nosed boss looked at the dark sly inside the arrogant guy's belly. This group of people is a newly emerging force, and is working hard to expand the territory, provoke disputes everywhere, and think that Tianwang Laozi is the second. "Don't think that I am afraid of you, as long as tomorrow is over..." These days, all the forces in the city are quiet, waiting for that special day to pass, but the exception of this class of outsiders, there is no convergence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Czechon has tried his best to cope with this scene. The people started to sit down and drink, of course, they will not pay! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Boss!" The young man suddenly asked after he finished his drink. "There are no boats here to go to Undead Island. No, no, no. No boat is betrayed!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone, including those guys, stopped all the movements in their hands, and everyone’s eyes were focused on this young knight (wearing The body should be the Cavaliers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of the red nose was pumped. "There is a boat at the dock, but I don't know if I have to sell it! Go and see it yourself!" Make sure this young man is new and doesn't know anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a minute!" One hand is in front, one of the people just now! "Do you want to go to Undead Island?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!" The young man hesitated and answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In any case, you have to go to that place, this beautiful armor seems to have no use for you! It is better to give it to me!" The young man said, but his face is a red nose boss who has turned white towards his face! Rather than saying that he wants to provoke things to grab this beautiful armor, it is better to threaten the boss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young knight is no longer talking, he grabs the hand in front and grabs it with force - the cracking of the bones is immediately passed from the hand come out! He can feel the killing of this person. In the face of such a person, there is no need to be merciful. Anyway, it is necessary to start with it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A scream came, the person who had to harm others is now a victim, screaming back, shattering the plate, screaming at the table, The sword is squirting into a piece. The boss was eager to get out of the house immediately, but Wei did not mean to go out. After being kicked off some table stools, it became very empty and very suitable for hands-on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Cut down the two hands of this kid!" A middle-aged man with a long sly face on his face shouted, telling the truth, They really don't dare to kill people today. If the dead today is here, this red nose will be crazy! Maybe you will immediately call a fierce Warcraft out, and clean up all the people here! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 02<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not concerned about this conflict that may bring harm at the moment. Anyway, my time is running out, and killing a few people is nothing remarkable! He did not know that these days were special days, and people here would not kill unless they hated them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he walked out of the hotel this morning to inquire about the news, he really knew what was going on. The result of despair and upset was that he decided to drink a glass of wine. Although the purpose of his coming out is to inquire about the situation of the ship, but with his current feelings, what kind of thinking is there to ask patiently one by one, at this time, alcohol may be something that people forget to worry about. Now that there was an accident, Wei felt a little happy because there was finally a vent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of people rushed up, a dozen people attacked one, this young man did not even pull out his sword, only had fists to fight, but this did not let This group of people accounted for how much cheaper, after all, wearing a full armor fight, but there is a big advantage. The other party’s hands are all light weapons, that is, they are relatively light and sharp swords, not the heavy weapons used to open the armor on the battlefield. The threat to the heavy armor is limited, let alone this one. Not armor belonging to this world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This armor is really wonderful. It’s very hard and it’s very flexible. It seems that you can judge the degree of attack to make sure you want to use it. What attitude to treat, the sword cut to the top does not feel the impact of being hit. If it is hard to say that there is something wrong, it is not complete enough, lacking helmets and gloves. Now Wei’s gloves belong to the armor that was destroyed by the demon king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei Boxing kicked the former guy out, this punch was in the middle of the chin, and I didn’t know if the guy’s chin bone was broken, but it’s In the gap brought by this action, the leader who has never been hands-on--it seems to be the leader--hands-on, a short-sword with a blue light slams into the gap, and the target points directly at the arm of Wei’s right hand. Strip gap (a gap that is left to make the joint flexible). Wei didn't hide or flash. He just needed to move his arm a little bit, so that the shot would be bounced off the arm and then the left fist would be a blow...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shoulder part came from the pain that could not be imagined, the body was paralyzed by this sudden pain, and the expected series of actions had not begun yet, and the short sword accurately penetrated from the intended target. , penetrated the entire arm. But compared with the pain on the back, the pain caused by the sword is really insignificant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come on? No, this is not, not so fast. In less than a second of judgment and analysis, the attacker has let go of his weapon and jumped back. Just this shot made him surprised. The movement of this agile young man seems to be fixed. He did not pick up the short sword because his sword was caught by the other's muscles, and he couldn't pull it out at once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood flowed down the blade that was inserted in the hand and dripped on the ground, but there were not many people standing still. Only half of it was left. The people who were hit by the man’s fist were still in a coma. . This sword that pierces the arm does not seem to have much effect, because this guy seems to have no reaction at all. No one dares to step forward, and everyone knows that the injured beast is more dangerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was that time! Wei began to think of the injury in this place, the half-orc, the hammer that was hit when he was alone with the half-orc...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The roaring sound came, the red nose boss knows that it is too late to stop this fight. If it is dead now, then... although his wife died last year, there is no family drag, but No one likes to die, especially after being killed as a sergeant - although this is an inevitable result, it is always the sooner the better. When no one noticed, there was already a Warcraft in the hotel - it was like a crab, and the body was wrapped in a carapace. The body of the carapace was a big mouth full of teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As suddenly as it appears, the huge pain on the back is receding at an alarming rate. There is no doubt that it is working. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go!" The leader stunned the Warcraft behind him and the soldiers in front of him. He saw that there was no benefit in continuing. This time it was the wrong object. Now! A group of people retreated to the door while raising the injured companion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei stood straight and the pain behind it had completely receded. He pulled out the short sword inserted in his hand and went to the exit. The guy threw it, but the originally harmless action - Wei's throwing did not hurt the plan - but let the guys react too aggressively, a trigger of the sarcophagus that was originally just for defense. After being detained, he couldn’t wait to shoot the target’s arrow and shoot it out to the warrior’s chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei’s body moves halfway - this is a completely instinctive movement, in fact, his armor can completely resist this level of attack - avoid this A blow, but Parker, who is in the same straight line as him, is not so lucky. The one that hides and sees the lively unlucky one falls down, and the throat is still showing the quivering tail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's over!" The red nose blinded his eyes, without careful investigation. Based on his experience, he knew that his old customer was not saved. An instruction immediately sent to him to summon the World of Warcraft to convey that the Warcraft, which has been inactive, immediately used the flexibility that is not commensurate with his clumsy body to rush to those who have not yet gone out. Anyway, it is already dead, and a few more dead and It’s one thing to die a few. Just to make this tone! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The screams and flesh and blood splashed together, and Warcraft blocked the door and blocked more than a dozen people in the pub. This thick armor monster is useless. Everyone's eyes are concentrated on the boss who summoned Warcraft. Now it is the only chance to knock down this red nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the burger-red nose boss who was just unassuming is now approaching them with fierce light. He turned a shield in his left hand like a magic. Changed a long sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Submissive to me!" The magician made the last attempt, but No use, nothing happened. The fireball that was originally expected to appear in the hand did not even appear a spark. The exhausted magician fell weakly on the grass, panting, and just for the sake of concentration, he even breathed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why is there no way to do it?" Kim carefully considered his own practice. This is a mistake, at least the memory of the dragon in his mind. Is such that. "Feel the existence of the elves, do not need to use any spells, let the elves communicate with you, let them do what you want!" But why is there no way to do it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This elder exchange with Dragon Elder has greatly helped the magician, but there is no denying that many of the things that Long Elder gave him are useless. Including many of the past, I have already remembered the magic spell. In the memory of the dragon, Kim gained a lot of new spells and knowledge related to magic, but, as the elders of the dragon themselves admit, the dragon has no way to gain the essence of human magic knowledge, because the dragons who are heterogeneous have no Ways to enter into a covenant with the gods of this world. It is because of this deficiency that the dragon developed its own dragon language magic! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important thing to get from the dragon elders is that feeling! After waking up on the dragon's back, Kim found that his body had already remembered this feeling. For the feeling of the omnipresent elf, the elder Long opened the door for his perception and let him experience the past and never experience it. All kinds of existence! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the magician is not discouraged. After all, it is only just beginning. He still has a long time to learn and explore. When everyone went out to find the way to Undead Island, only he and Beibei stayed together, this little girl still did not recover from the loss of the "children", the mood is very low! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What the hell are you doing? The magician brother?" Looking at the magician’s hard work for a while - as if in the stool - a moment of powerlessness On the ground, Babe feels very strange. This is how children are, and it is easy to be attracted to other things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The group of them arrived here by Xiaolong. They originally wanted to reach the Undead Island directly, but this task was beyond the capabilities of the Blue Dragon. What power is guarding the island, and life is not allowed to approach. In the absence of a solution, the dragon took them to the nearest place to the Undead Island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 03<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This city called De Merlin is obviously a bit strange, the earliest was last night When I found the hotel, I found that the owner of the hotel refused the guests very simply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stay in a hotel? Sorry, you are the adventurer who just came from outside. This hotel is now temporarily closed for three days, no one is welcome! You are going to visit The place!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the same is true of all other places, all the hotels claim to be temporarily closed, as if they have colluded and went on strike together. Finally, with Lev's slippery tongue, the owner of a hotel finally agreed to let them live for one night, but only allowed to stay for one night and must go out tomorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, this morning, everyone went to a small village outside the city. (It’s very strange, now the people in the village have gone out, but obviously it’s not abandoned. The village, because everything is well organized) - originally intended to be used for accommodation, but now it seems that there is no need to ask - there is a camp, except for the magician and babe, others go out to find the means of transportation to Undead Island. - that is, the ship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The elf doesn't listen to my commands, no matter which kind of elf is the same! Why?" Kim said to himself, he did not hear Babe's question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why should the elves listen to your commands? The magician brother! They are not raised by you, just like a baby!" Babe said, but mentioned the baby. His eyes are red again immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes! They don't have to listen to my orders, but why can the high goblins command them? Is it the nature of race..." The magician's words When he didn't finish it, he noticed that Babe's expression changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't cry! Don't cry! Don't worry, the dragons will take good care of the baby! It is better to take care of you! You should be happy when your baby is happy. Right!" Seeing Babe showing a sign of crying, Kim was a little panicked. Taking care of the little girl was not his specialty. He completely forgot the magical problems he had just considered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know if they will take a shower every day and trim their claws every three days!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It will be, they will wash the baby three times a day, cut the paws twice!" Because it is not a person who is good at lying, the magician's current lies can not withstand scrutiny, but it seems Babe did not intend to scrutinize. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really? Don't lie to me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really, I never lie People!" This sentence is a lie in itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s weird, I heard that this is a very bad law, dead The place where the individual is almost the same as the ant-killing ant, did not expect it to be good! It seems that the rumors are not worthy of trust!" Leif said as if he casually put a hand on the shoulder of the person around him, but the corner of his eye Yu Guang immediately noticed that the two pairs of eyes were aiming at his hand, so the hand just shrank back when he took a look at Erna. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is different from Wei, which is like a headless fly. When they entered the city, they immediately asked about the way to the pier. Originally they should be divided into three batches to visit, but I don't know for what (?) they have not been separated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adventurer, do you want to go out to sea? It's a smart choice. I am a very generous person. Even in this case, I only accept 50 diamond coins!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Boss, we don't need a sea boat, we only use" Lev hand pointed to a smaller ship not far away. "Like that big, you can go out to sea for about a month. "You can!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am referring to a ship of that size. Do you think that if I own a sea boat, will I still stand here and do business with you? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The kind of ship also has 50 diamond coins??" Although the specific price of the ship is not very clear, how can such a large and small ship be worth? This kind of money - unless he is made of gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you don't want it, even if you don't want it!" This slightly fat, bald guy puts on a look of indifference. "I will declare first, except me, no. Two people will sell the ship at this time!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This time???!!!" Behan heard the meaning of the boss, the hotel would refuse The guest made him feel very wrong. "Boss, what special day is it today?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't know?" The bald man's face I showed an unbelievable expression, but this expression disappeared immediately. "Is it new to you? I don't think I feel like a blind eye! Do you want to know what day is it today? Yeah, but intelligence is not free, give I will tell you ten gold coins, I will explain first, this is related to your life and death, do not despise this money!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We go!" The husband was very disgusted with the behavior of the guy who was robbed by the fire. He was determined to fight with this kind of person. Road time for them to think about what benefits are available. Behind the three people, the voice of the profiteer was heard, "You will regret to save the money!" But no one cares for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This time..." After going far, Behan turned and said to two companions, "I think there must be a problem. Today must be a special Days, I think, maybe we have to figure out what is going on here!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The ground is full of bodies, this is mostly a masterpiece of Warcraft, the stinger of Warcraft's abdomen is a deadly weapon. In front of the red nose and Warcraft, all the people who did not come and escaped became a corpse. Now there are only red noses left in the store, the shell of Warcraft, and Wei three standing, Wei just been cold. Look at the massacre. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red nose puts his weapon away, but Warcraft turns his face - this should be the face - to the only survivor Wei. But the red nose is not going to conflict with this young man. Warcraft suddenly disappears into the air like a bubble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, what should I do next? Just start as soon as possible, I hope there is still time to run, damn, today, even those who clean up the body will not come, so I have to let They are lying in my shop like this!" The red nose boss did not care about the Wei standing still, opened the cabinet, took all the money out, put it in his own pocket, and muttered in his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Young people, are you still not going?" When the red nose was going out, it was discovered that Wei was still watching the body on the ground in a daze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hotel owner’s words made Wei’s dream come awakened, he just gently stroked the place where he was injured on his right hand, and was stimulated by this accident. He was shocked that all the wounds in his hand had disappeared, and the last little illusion that existed in his heart was also crushed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the curse of the devil! Wei heard from his well-informed teacher the curse of this evil technology. By aiming at objects that are related to the target or the target, the target is attacked by a special method, and the vitality of the target is consumed. Although it is not a skill of killing, but it can make the target slow, but it is indeed going to death. The most obvious sign of the cursed is that the body's ability to recover is amazing, but it is actually a manifestation of loss of vitality. After the golden age of the longest six months and the shortest six months, the cursed man began to rapidly debilitate and age, and died in less than three months. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why the Devil did not kill himself. He wants to let himself experience the horror of death! It was first discovered on Long Island, but at the time it was thought that Elna’s healing was still working—although it’s actually noticed, it’s just not acknowledging it—but this morning, when he When the hand was scratched a small hole by a damn nail, he had to face up to this reality, and he was indeed cursed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't know? Don't say it, go quickly, it's too late to come!" Red nose pulled the young alcoholic out of the store, I don't know why, he is very fond of this young man, maybe just Wei He is grateful for his actions with his fist instead of his sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people walked out of the hotel door, and even the red nose had no time to add a "suspended business" sign to his hotel, and the sky was dark. This is not a black cloud or a group of birds, but a layer of gray "film" - which can only be called for the time being) - shrouded the sky, although not as dark as the night, but the light is dim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's over!" The red-nosed boss felt that both legs were soft, and even the brand fell from his hand. He did not expect this early this year. It’s too late to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the original! Three people are flying all the way, and now I am still coming, and I have to tell my friends to leave! Today is actually the day when the Necromancer came here. It is ironic to say that the fortress to resist the Necromancer has now become the ruling land of the Necromancer. Today and tomorrow are the special days for them to "tax collection"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 04<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky suddenly darkened, and three people couldn’t help but stop. Look up and see that this is not a natural phenomenon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know!" But the residents here know very well What is going on here, everyone is rushing to pack things up, speeding up the pace, and there is a silent rush in the streets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It must be a sign that the Necromancer came!" Behan asserted, "Don't leave him alone, hurry, if there is any conflict with the Necromancer now, we Don't even sneak into the Undead Island!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This... What is this all about?" Wei looked at the sky, this change is too strange, definitely not a good sign. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Necromancer is coming!" The red nose bent over and picked up the sign that fell on the ground, hanging it on the door of his pub, the initial panic After the fear and the past, he returned to the normal state, anyway, all came, fear is useless! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Necromancer?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes! They are coming to collect the bodies, Young man, it seems that you and I are within the scope of their collection!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "What's the matter?" Looking at the strange "black film" in the sky, the magician is very strange. The surrounding elves are very calm and there are no fluctuations, that is to say, this is not any magic - at least not any magic known - but it doesn't look like a natural phenomenon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s weird!" The magician scouted a little with perceptualism. This black film is not an ordinary thing, it has a strange power protection, letting perception The magic can't pass, but it can be judged according to this feature. This black membrane is buckled over the city like a huge bowl. The range is very large, and the distance between gold and the nearest edge is also nearly 50 kilometers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It won't be the end of the world!" Kim said half-jokingly, but in fact he didn't worry much about this strange thing. According to the knowledge given to him by the elders of the dragon, such a huge magic - if it is a magic - there is no way to resist a certain point of attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, babe!" The magician asked the little summoner who was feeding an ant with a bug. "What is your father?" ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why ask this?" Babe turned her head and looked at Kim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I feel that you haven’t wanted to go home for so long, it’s a bit strange." Indeed, when Babe knew that everyone else was going to send her back. When I used all the methods to obstruct, from spoiling to refusing to cooperate (indicating the situation near my hometown), the methods that a child can use are used, and there is no way for others to get it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kim doesn't talk, this girl's character is actually quite strange, but it is born to be an adventurer's material. Although I have been traveling with my partners for some time, in fact, the past knowledge of other people (except Wei) is actually limited, but this does not affect the relationship between them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Everyone is back!" Babe’s cheers interrupted the wizard’s ideas. With her voice, five people appeared in the field of vision, one more than when they went out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the original! After listening to the words of the red nose boss, everyone understood the general situation. The fortress built in the past to monitor the defeated Necromancer was abandoned because of the internal warfare of mankind. The people who lived here because of the protection of this fortress turned the first target of the Necromancer attack. The internal melee countries are unable to take care of this small-scale harassment, and there is no power here to withstand the undead army. In the absence of other options, the threatened city and the Necromancer reached a peace treaty, and the Necromancer could obtain the body of the dead person here. In return, the Necromancer stopped all attacks. Although this kind of behavior is essentially drinking and quenching thirst, but by the bodies of one or two cities, the necromancer wants to reinvigorate the original military forces and does not know how long it will take, so this peace situation has continued. Every year, the Necromancers come here to collect the bodies, and today and tomorrow are the days when they come here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, everyone will be hiding at home today, and when they go out to meet the undead, they will die. No one dares to kill. Once a person dies, those undead will go smoothly. The smell of death is coming to the door! Like this new village, it is not recognized by the necromancer, so everyone here goes to a safe place!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" What happened to this black film?" The magician couldn't help but ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This should be the magic of the Necromancer! Although I don't know exactly how, but I heard that if someone passes through this black cover, he will stay on him. Under some sort of mark, the soldiers will find you! But this is just a rumor. Everyone believes that this is to let the people in this area not escape. During this time, all the foreigners (without residence) will join the undead army. The Necromancer can get more corpses!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do we do? Wait for death?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"That's why! In the scope of this black cover, the undead should not be able to determine our position, maybe we have a chance to escape this robber!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "When will the Necromancer come? Are you here now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know, I used to hide in my pub in previous years, but today It seems that it is no good, and there is such a dead person in the pub, even if the necromancer catches a cold, he can smell it inside. Dead body taste!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night falls, it turns out that because of the black "film "The dim sky is now completely out of reach, and the most inconspicuous group of people hiding behind the coast can only know each other's existence through the breathing of each other." Hiding here is the idea of ​​Kim. "The more dangerous the place is, the safer it is." Concealing the place where the undead are ashore can instead escape the search of the soldiers. The facts are the same as the magician thought, they saw the black ship loaded with the undead to the shore. (I don't know why, the necromancer chose a beach instead of the port. And it was chosen by the adventurer. In the vicinity of the group, the group of undead sorcerers and sergeants went to the shore and disappeared into the interior. They did not search the coast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why don't they leave?" The magician whispered around him. The hotel owner, now a few green fires on the coast, a necromancer - not too clear to see too far - seems to be waiting in the wildfire. All the soldiers, including those they had just dug out of the tomb, stood on one side, and some of them were obviously just killed. The efficiency of the Undead Legion is really high. It took only half a night and they completed their work.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do I know!" It was said that although he had been in the city for more than ten years, this scene was the first time he saw it. He joined the unwilling group because he had nowhere else to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A man in a luxurious robe appeared in the light of a wildfire accompanied by two soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tello! God! He actually and the Necromancer..." The red nose whispered an exclamation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know that guy?" Looking at a human being, a living human being appeared in the place where the undead were gathered, and Lev was surprised to say nothing. coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He is Tylo, the richest and most powerful person in the city. If Demerin has one of the highest rulers, it is him!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tyllo went to the necromancer, as if to welcome him, the fires suddenly lit up. Two people—no, one person and one undead—start talking, and from their actions, this is a very friendly conversation. "Be careful!" Behan sent an alarm. Everyone tried to squat down as much as possible. A group of corpses walked past the grove. From their rotten half of the body, they were just awakened from the grave. . Although this grove is not really hidden, it is obvious that these undead have not noticed them. As they approached, a strong corpse smell almost made everyone breathless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just when everyone thought they were finally gone, another team of undead appeared again, and this time it came directly to the bushes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, we were discovered!" But this thought flashed past, the team’s undead is the same as the one just now, the action is slow and dull, and the team is the slightest No change, it is not like trying to attack them. Just when everyone is not sure what to do, they are at the side of the adventurer - almost sticking to the body - one by one. Obviously, they did not recognize the difference between these living people and trees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the team’s twenty guys passing by, the thief’s mind suddenly flashed a bold and crazy thought. He pushed the magician around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe we don't have to find a boat!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you mean?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Would those boats not be good?" Lev's fingers berthed at the beach in the row of black ships used to carry the undead! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why should I come with you?" Red nose boss for the fourth time Ask this question, but no one can answer. They are now on a black ship driven by the undead. In order not to mix with the stuff full of corpses, everyone hid on the upper deck of the ship after boarding the ship. There are only black iron blocks in addition to these uninvited guests. It was discovered after dawn that these were rough black armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because you are afraid of one person!" But these words can only be said in my heart, Behan did not let it pass the vocal cords. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 05<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day is already bright, it can be seen clearly from the window of the ship. See the blue sky and the blue sky. The undead apparently did not have the habit of checking the cabin and wiping the deck. All seven desperate people still lived well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the passage of time, the red nose boss no longer blames, he followed the six people hiding in the body and mixing the boat half because the individual is collective The blind half, the other half is because they are also eager for a stimulating adventure - with this group of young people almost let him forget his age. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are these armor used for?" Behan picked up a helmet that was very thick, far exceeding the standard of ordinary body armor, but it was built. Very rough, even the grinding process is omitted, the sharp iron thorns on the side are everywhere, the typical unqualified goods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s not for the sergeant to wear it!" Lev tried to pick up a pair of breastplates. The ghosts were heavy and according to human standards. Manufactured, if the sergeant puts on it, I am afraid that an action will fall from the body, how to look at it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a discussion without a result, everyone put this topic aside, the only result is the key to the connection between Tylo and the Necromancers. Just above these inferior armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's here!" When the sun has not risen high, Elna, who is at the window, has issued an alarm. The outline of the island has already appeared in the distance. Everyone has seen it over. The island is not as imaginary as it is. Scorched earth, on the contrary, the green grass trees, a piece of life, do not match his name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is like my home!" The little girl posted comments on the side that no one noticed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s going well!" Everyone came out of a rock cavern washed out by the tide. Like the bold conclusions of the thieves, apart from the necromancers, other walking deads cannot identify the souls and the dead. The range that the six necromancers could control was very limited (and they didn't even think of it). The seven men took an empty space and sneaked out of the dead spirits to hide in a place that the necromancer could not detect. It was not discovered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't think this island is so beautiful!" Behan sent out his feelings. If the Necromancer is completely destroyed, the island must be a very suitable place to travel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The undead team has gone far, leaving only a row of black boats left unattended at the seaside. If the adventurer wants to escape, it is now the most Good opportunity, but human nature does not know how to satisfy. Since it is here, isn’t it a pity to leave this way? So after a little preparation, the squad began to advance into the depths of the island. ......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a dark room, a figure wearing a white robe and a black robe sat across from each other. Among the two people is a crystal ball that is emitting soft white light. The crystal ball is faithfully showing the daring daring of those who dare to step into this taboo island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s so interesting! Someone dared to come here? It seems that your undead army can add members again!” The figure wearing a white robe smirked Laughter, it seems to be ridiculing those who are self-imposed, "Give the image a bit and see who these guys are, so don't know how!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sit The black robe opposite him did not say anything. He just extended a hand and touched the crystal ball. The image on the crystal ball was immediately enlarged, and the appearance of the seven people could be clearly seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah..." The white robe made a cry of surprise, but it stopped immediately, replaced by a smug and evil laughter. Fair, you can now fall into my hands!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Immediately launch an attack and bury these guys on the spot!" He said loudly to the black robe But the black robe is still holding his head down, no sound, no action. The white robe found that the attitude he had just said was too rude. He used a dry cough to cover up his uneasiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Forget it, it’s too boring to kill them like this! You should have fun before you kill them, right?" But the black robe is still Nothing is heard, no reaction. ......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are still very calm surroundings, only the sound of flapping wings from one or two birds that have been stunned from time to time. If it wasn’t for personal experience, no one would have thought that it was the Undead Island. The original cautious adventurer has now put up a vigilant heart, especially Babe, and he has already jumped on the road. It seems that either the Necromancer is not the same as the legend, or the island is too big for them, but everyone tends to the second possibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is really a good place!" At the lunch, Red Nose published his opinion. This was agreed by everyone because of the passage. It’s not like an adventure, it’s like an outing. Although the woods on this island are dense, they are not the kind of wood that cannot be walked away. On the contrary, it seems to be specially planted for people to travel. Everyone is eating, and when Babe tries to feed a bird with some breadcrumbs, a voice is making a vicious curse across a crystal ball. "Eat, enjoy it, but you can enjoy it with peace of mind." The last meal."...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where are we going now!" Lev asked as he looked at the compass in his hand. I have been walking in the woods for so long, and I don’t know when the compass begins to lose its usefulness. Everyone finally began to feel a little dangerous atmosphere from the illusion of the outing. Time is already late (the sun has not seen it), but it has lost its direction at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, I cut the bark all the way and made a road sign!" Behan said as he touched the mark he had just made in the tree, with a signpost. Even if you don't know where to go, you know where to go. But his face quickly became stiff, because in the process of his stroke mo, the part of the bark that was cut off was quickly re-grown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
