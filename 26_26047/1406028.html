			<div id="content">Shahai is innocent. In the long sand, all the sights are yellow, monotonous and godless. The sun squeezing its own territory like a tyrant, even now close to dusk, still fiercely cast a burning red light, leaving a last bit of evidence for his cruelty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the wilderness of the desert, the little boy looked desperately at the top of his head. He is too far away from home, no one will know that he is coming here naughty, and no one will come here to save him from the trap of Satay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sand and sand spiders, this is the most terrible enemy of single travelers in the desert. A person with a kind of fire may be able to cope with the net of the sand spider, but if it falls into the trap of the sand, it is impossible to escape by personal strength. This monster that specializes in corpses digs a trap and waits for his natural ally, the Liege, to help him kill the captives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The child gave a cry with a cry. The small voice echoed in the middle of the vast wilderness and was quickly swallowed up by the space. It is far from the desert avenue and there will be no travellers passing by. And even if his family launches enough people to search for him tomorrow, he will only find a body that has been killed by the scorching sun. Even a body that was incomplete by Satay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun slowly disappeared, leaving only the red clouds. The cry of the little boy has become hoarse. If the sun can last for an hour or two, maybe he can finish tomorrow's work and kill the child who is weak under desperation and exhaustion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The child finally got tired. He closed his eyes and slowly fell into a drowsy state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A slender shadow cast his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are on the wrong road, gold!" A noisy voice awakened the little boy from lethargy. He opened his eyes and saw a figure in the thick cloak that was unique to the desert standing in front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A child?" A strange accent came out of the cloak, apparently different from the person who spoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are on the wrong track." Another voice insisted. Then the child saw a black bird flying a few laps in the air and then stopped at the shoulder of the stranger. It was actually this bird who was talking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man did not pay attention to the crow (it looks like a crow, but the crow is unlikely to speak), but has been walking to the little boy. He knelt down and the little boy saw a pair of gentle eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong?" asked the stranger. “Need help?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little boy was full of tears and his face was desperately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Close your eyes." The stranger said with a smile. "I will help you out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little boy closed his eyes. He suddenly felt that the solid hard soil around him began to loosen. Then the stranger's hand hugged his shoulder and pulled his body out of the trap. He couldn't help but open his eyes and was surprised to see the land beneath him turned into quicksand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What did you do just now?" The little boy is engaged in rigid hands and feet. "Are you a traveler?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A little trick." The stranger smiled. "I came from the north, crossed the desert, and thought of Silver Leaf Town. Do you know where?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My home is on the edge of Silver Leaf Town." Little boy Forced to beat a few times, maybe he never thought that being free to move is so happy. "I will take you there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, thank you. Look," the stranger's face turned to the crow. "I didn't go wrong."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your movement error has exceeded the limit, otherwise you will not need others to lead the way." The crow insisted, "I reminded you "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stranger did not answer, he noticed that the child's eyes were staring at the crow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you... a crow?" asked the little boy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Crow? You actually said that I am a crow?" The crow flew up and down in front of the child, "It’s too rude. My name is the black cone. You have to call me Mr. Wubi. When you see a stranger, you must add 'Mr.' after the title. Don’t you understand this? There is no politeness. How did your aunt teach you?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"U-cone...Mr.?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is almost the same." The black cone stopped on the boy's shoulder and began to comb his feathers. "What is your name?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My name is Ana."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, Ana. Let me introduce, this big man is called Kim, and I am his mentor and travel companion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's go, Ana "Gold talked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gold...Sir, are you a juggler?" The little boy ran and asked cheerfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Juggling artist? Who told you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because you carry a very Interesting pets."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden's face stayed for a while, then couldn't help but laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pet...hahahaha..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's funny! Damn!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the wilderness, the sound of the black cones and the sorrowful sounds of the gold and the laughter of the little boy and the lively laughter of the little boy are mixed for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This journey is not very long. Before the day is completely black, travelers can already see the buildings that stand in the distance. He has already arrived in Yinye Town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is my home!" The little boy excitedly pointed to the low mud room on one side. "Mr. Kim, if you want, you can spend the night at my house. My dad will welcome you very much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you." Kim smiled and refused. Invitation for the little boy. "I want to go to the city. If you have the chance, go to your house next time. Be careful next time, don't go to the place where the sand is haunted."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The little boy ran in the direction of the home. On the empty ground, only gold and black cones are left to look at the towns not far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Silver Leaf Town," Gold whispered, while pulling the mask of the cloak to cover the nose and mouth - just like the traveler in the dusty weather Do the same. “The gathering point of the desert gangs.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Be careful, gold. Our goal is not to cause unnecessary trouble.”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weather is already late. Pedestrians on the street are sparse, and few people have noticed this stranger who entered the town. You know, this town is located on the edge of the desert. There are no more than a thousand strangers coming and going every day. Of course, this is only for ordinary citizens or businessmen. For others, single travelers are always the focus of their attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Just here? Traveler?" After Kim turned into an alley, a middle-aged man with a moustache appeared in front of him. “Do you need a tour guide?” he said in a slapstick style that was unique to rogue extortion. "A gold coin I can let you avoid the traps of profiteers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No need." Jin smiled. He turned and wanted to get rid of this unexpected incident. However, the situation is not as good as he imagined, and there are already three obstacles behind him. The middle figure is tall and stout, and the face is yellow bristles - it is actually a half-orc. These three are all guys in their hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Our service is very thoughtful and guaranteed value for money." The former middle-aged man continued. "You will need it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't cause trouble." The crow on his shoulder said in a voice he could only hear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden for a moment, these four people blocked his path before and after, and it seems that there is no choice but to resort to force or succumb. So he went to the middle-aged man - who seemed to be a leader - and reached out and found a coin from his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I accept your service." He handed the coin over and the other hand reached for it. At the moment of contact with the hands, Kim’s hand was pinched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I should say that you are smart, or are you rash?" The black cone shot his wings. "You have provoked some local snakes, which may cause unnecessary trouble for our goals."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This trouble should be indifferent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are too confident... I told you, your share Justice and self-esteem are very boring for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe. But I let you drop those things at once." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Forget it, whatever you want." The black cone seems to have finally given up. "What are you going to do next?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Like the average person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Like ordinary people?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It’s just to find a hotel to stay and ask for the information we need.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Gold moves along the street while looking at both sides of the street. Vendors on both sides of the street looked at the passing passengers with hopeful eyes and expected to make their last business in the day. However, they were disappointed. Kim slowly moved forward and did not stop at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many hotels in Yinye Town. In fact, as a town on a desert road, one-third of the entire town can be used for guests to live in - as long as there is enough money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold took a long walk and fancy a hotel, not for anything else, because the hotel sign painted a big crow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden the door, the guy at the door is flattering and welcome. This kind of diligent attitude made Jin feel a bit strange, but when he got inside, he immediately understood the reason. The inn's lobby is large, and the high ceilings are supported by beautifully shaped arches and slim columns. Almost every inch of the wall, floor and ceiling is coated with a shiny metal, and in some places the walls and ceilings are painted with exotic ornate patterns from all races. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gambling everywhere. The room is filled with men and women of all ages, most of them are gorgeously dressed, and some are dressed in travellers' costumes. People have to roll the dice, play cards, and play other gambling. At the gambling table closest to him, two women raised their glasses and triumphantly laughed; opposite, a man shouted angrily, clamoring for a ghost. The sound of gold coins exchanged one after another, and you can hear the winner’s cheers and losers everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to this room, there is another smaller room inside. Looking through the open door, a woman dances striptease on the table. The waitress exposed by the dress repeatedly walks through the crowd, carrying beer or wine. From time to time, a waitress smirked and fell into the arms of the guests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A brothel, casino plus hotel." The crow made a conclusion after saying, "Gold, you really picked the right place."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's really appropriate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An obese man greeted him with five points on his face, five points I liked it, obviously I just took it. "Would you like to come to a game?" He challenged the scorpion in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A chance." The crow posted a hint at the golden ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Kim replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The casino people didn’t express much surprise at this stranger with a big cloak. As everyone knows, in this town full of people of all kinds of origins, it is not surprising that a person hides his face. Moreover, the store cares about the guests' pockets, not their faces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He actually gambled with the fat man!" Several people gave a laughter of gloating. Someone gave up the seat. So Kim sat down and met the fat man face to face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want to compare the size or the number of pressure points?" The fat man threw the scorpion into the air and then caught it again. The movement of the fingers was so fast. If it is an ordinary person, it is decided that he has changed a blind man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the voice was boiling at this time, no one thought that the crow had just spoken. Many people have come around and want to visit the gambling scene. People saw that the fat man took out twenty gold coins and took a big shot on the table. The stranger also touched twenty coins in a quiet manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Right."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man picked up one of the gold coins he took out from the other side and saw Look. This is indeed the real castle coin, that is to say, not the inferior gold coins that have been used since ancient times (although these ancient coins are still used frequently, but the value is very different from the coin). This stranger is dressed up ordinary, but it is indeed a rich Lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then we come bigger than the size, the big one wins. Six dice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The stranger did not answer, just made a "please" gesture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several people started to squat. Almost no one here dare to play this game with this fat man, because the fat man's technology is very clever. Whether it is pure skill or cheating skills. He is a professional gambler. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People quickly issued a second scream. Because of several consecutive, the fat man has thrown a rare six points. The stranger is calm and self-sufficient, and wins with the loss. Instead, the fat man loses his own money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Recommended!" The fat man blinked red, tearing a ruby ​​ring from his finger and placing it on the table. He pointed his hand, "This bet all the things in front of you, one game will be won."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay." The voice of the stranger is very calm. The gamble of such a big bet has aroused the interest of the audience. Everyone has been talking about it, and it is generally believed that this is a trap for the fat man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crow wiped his mouth on the gold cloak. It doesn't care about the outcome of this gamble. The average person and a magician have no good results, which has been the case since ancient times. It turned its attention to other places in the room and began to appreciate the rare decoration of the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cheat, cheating! I don't gamble!" The fat man finally made a wise choice. "There must be problems. For seven consecutive games, he is just a little more than me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Friends, since it is gambling, naturally there is luck." The stranger replied as he put away the bet in front of him. "It’s just that your luck is not good today. Especially when you change your voice, you shouldn’t show it to me.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His last sentence is very light, but The fat man seemed to be stunned by the scorpion, and the whole person bounced and his face turned from red to white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sneer around the people, so the fat man left the casino in a laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This stranger stood up from his seat and began to look around in the casino. Many people expressed interest in him, but no one dared to invite him to a game. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you a cup?" A woman came in front of him. Heavy makeup, jewels. The woman handed a cup of drink that didn't know what it was, but the smell of the anesthetic inside was very clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." He waved away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I treat you." The woman does not continue to entangle. Kim judged the amount of anesthetic - if it is a lack of wariness of ordinary people to drink, a few minutes will begin to blur the mind, and then taken out by this woman, brought to some place to peel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, there are too many anesthetics inside." He replied, and the woman disappeared into the crowd without a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the places that are confusing, there are opportunities everywhere, and there are traps everywhere. And the average person can't distinguish between the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another person came together, this time is a very cool girl. There was a blush on her face and it was obviously drunk. She said something that no one could understand, and she got the gold body, and stretched out the face of the gold cloak. The cloak couldn't bear the pull, so it was pulled down half. The face that was originally hidden below is obvious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that it is not enough. After a few minutes, Kim began to take the initiative to participate in gambling. He quickly caught the attention of the entire casino: because he only won. The speed of gambling accumulation is amazing. In a short incident, he turned into a sea of ​​jewellery and coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Five hundred gold coins." Gold casually reported a number, and did not change the color of the heart. The bookmaker who accepted the gamble has already shivered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Five hundred...open."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There must be ghosts!" The same sound as a wolverine. "He got the same straight flush in every game, and it was twenty-five in a row. It's impossible!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Royal Flush, I won." Kim ignored the words next to him and showed his cards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dealer wiped a bunch of coins into the face of gold with a cold sweat. But Kim immediately pushed it all out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This time I am next thousand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a minute, guest..." The banker finally couldn’t afford it, and the guest was obviously not good – the bet in front of him was close to the casino’s full monthly turnover. "This is not a high amount."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, the opening is still afraid of the appetite of the guests?" The voice of a drowning fish screamed in the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay. Then this bet is still five hundred gold coins." Kim answered patiently. He is very clear that this will continue, and someone will always come to negotiate with him. In general, people who open casinos have a good path. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a minute, guest." A voice came from behind the crowd. The people who watched the crowds flashed away and several people came to Kim. The leader is a gorgeous man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you talk alone?" The man smiled. "It won't delay you for a long time. Just for a while."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally came. Kim stood up and he grabbed a hand from the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your money, we will give you a good one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No. Jin Gaosheng shouted to the crowd around him. "The money is given to everyone, who wants to take it." He followed the man - it should be the casino owner - into a room on one side, leaving a group of men and women huddled together to grab a group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My name is Kim." Kim immediately introduced himself after he was seated. He reached out and pointed at the crow resting on his shoulder. "He called the black cone." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, okay, Mr. Jin, my name is Lake. We said straight to the point, you are here, don’t want to play a few. I’m right? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Very correct."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, what do you want?"< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, I just want to know one thing. A few months ago, an old caravan with an experience set off from the north of the desert, with the goal of crossing the desert. But the team Did not reach the destination."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, maybe it was swallowed up by Desert Storm. This is very common."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe. The desert storm's appetite is not very good, not swallowing everything, leaving a dead body with a gun."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then they should It’s not unusual to encounter desert bandits. But why do you care about this? Are you the owner of the caravan? IMHO, Mr. Jin, you don’t look like a businessman.” Lake laughed a little, revealing the white tooth. "A businessman is definitely not going to give up money easily."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not a businessman, the caravan has nothing to do with me. But at least I Know one thing: Many goods that have been robbed by bandits will appear in the market town of Silver Leaf after a while."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not wrong, I don't want to hide it." In fact, if it is not this role, it may have been completely looted by fierce gangsters. This is a relationship of coexistence and co-prosperity. So why do you ask me about this? I am just a How do the owner of the hotel know where the caravan is going? Do you have relatives in that caravan?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Unfortunately, I don't know. Although I am very willing to help you inquire about it, I reminded in advance that although some of the desert bandits have been brought here, they are only part of them. They have other channels to come. Dealing with loot."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This doesn't have to bother. I can be sure that the shipment was delivered to the town."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It may also have been sold."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So please tell me who bought the lot of things. As long as the message is correct, the rest I will do it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You alone?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, just I am one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are those goods?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is a war with the Orcs Trophy," Kim replied. "Mainly some dwarf weapons armor and some handicrafts. Maybe a little fur."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"very ordinary goods, may be taken apart for sale "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Even if it is demolished, it is also opened in Silver Leaf Town. I would be grateful if you can help."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lake got up and said he was willing to serve. So Kim also got up and planned to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait, Mr. Jin, if you don't want to give up, please stay with me." When Kim wanted to open the door, Lake suddenly screamed. "Although only the oysters are foraging, they are not worthy of the guests, but I must tell the next person to serve them carefully."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold out of the door, there is already a small waiting at the door. He took the gold through the lobby and the heavy aisle, and finally came to the door of a room. Xiao Yan salutes, so Jin himself walks into the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s all over the eyes. But almost everyone ignored the pet crow that the golden shoulder originally stayed in. The crow is no longer on his shoulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our helpful casino owner, Lake, does comply with the promise. Shortly after Kim left the room, he welcomed a second guest. A man dressed up ordinary, but his face has a huge scar that can not be ignored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Eagle, 'Black Storm' has there been any goods shipped here recently?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, boss. Recently the business is booming, I can't remember it. If you need this situation, then I have to go back and investigate. What do you ask this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "There was a strange guy who asked me about this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know the specific origin. It is a man who calls himself a gold. The whole body is a strange smell, it doesn't look like a guy who can easily pass."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want to..." This man, called the Eagle, made a gesture of cutting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I suspect he is not good... even... I am worried that he may be a wizard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Witches? Wizards come here? This is impossible. They can't leave their territory... You know the wizards, they will weaken and leave themselves when they leave their nest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I also think it's unlikely... forget it, don't say this. Help me investigate the business dealings of the Black Storm, not only with our business, others and the Black Storm. The business is also going to investigate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But the business of the bandit is not only in our town...they sell a lot of channels..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You only need to know the situation in our town."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eagle retreated. Lake shakes the bell and the other one walks in. This time is a beautiful young man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master, I excused to go through the room and carefully observe A moment. He had taken off his cloak in the room. As you can see, he had almost no luggage. The cloak had only one bag of things except the clothes and weapons. He didn't even have a water bag. It is impossible to cross the desert."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Surely weird...other? For example, looks?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "I have never heard of people with similar looks. Maybe I am ignorant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What weapon did he bring? What armor to wear?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A long sword. The body is ordinary clothes, no armor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Strange... "There is a wrinkle on Lake's face that represents deep thought. "It is said that he feels very hard on his body. Under the cloak is a armor... Forget it, go on."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Out of the window Crows fluttering wings and left the windowsill, black body and dark blend. He flew to another window sill not far away, where an open window was welcoming him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The casino owner is already helping you inquire about the news." The black cone stopped in front of Kim. "But your dress made him suspicious. He suspected you were a wizard." He looked at the gold equipment. "But you can really be suspicious. Travelers who have crossed the desert have no mounts, no water bags, no food bags... It's no wonder that you have nothing, others are not surprised to have ghosts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Forget it, I will pay attention next time. It is enough to get the news now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That said, Kim. You are too eye-catching now... you should do better."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do it better?" Kim stood up , came to the side of the mirror, some confused looking at himself in the mirror - a tall, handsome, smiling man. "What is the point of doing better? For me now..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are confused." The crow flew over his head, "than I imagined it a little earlier. But you are already confused."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't have it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "You have, you are confused. You start to question your existence - this is a good thing. Soon, you will learn to observe everything in another mood. But you will be confused again and change yourself again. This is Can't change."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Forget it." Jin smiled. "Right, it seems that I can only stay in the room tonight, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is true." Wu cone answered. He flew up and fell to a shelf by the bed. "Come on, lie down on the bed, I will tell you some stories. One night will soon pass."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, I don't want to hear the story. "Gold lay down on the bed, feeling exhausted and stunned." "I was wondering, what kind of mood did the wizards spend every night?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fear and worry. It should be like this. Power is Such a thing, no one always tries his best to sacrifice everything to get it. When it is really getting the most power, this thing becomes a hot potato, it can’t be lost, it’s very painful to hold.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They ruled by darkness and fear, ruled by blood and death... So what did you get in the end?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"You are too sentimental."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am just...some doubt..." Kim’s eyes widened, but he did not say it. His eyes looked at the ceiling and fell into deep meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remove some of your boring sense of justice, you will do better than you are now. If you are not the one who mixed the ball, the thief sent mercy, We don't have to go on this long journey of discovery." The crow continued to talk. "You saved him, his reward is to steal your things. In this world, some things are born to be destroyed. Some things are not worthy of sympathy - no matter what happened to him. But this is good, you are more After a few times, you won't be so full of blood, you can face other people indifferently."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have come again. You gotta, didn't you kill him at the end?" The crow laughed and made the first "wow" sound. "Now, let's talk about this... It's serious to get our things back. Really, I did tell you that valuable things should be prepared... but you are always so confident and don't listen to me." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will pay attention next time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Next time? It is next time... ... Yeah, anyway, we have time, there can be more than enough 'next time'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Kim appeared in the lobby, time was not too early. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This store is much bigger than expected. Including casinos, dance halls, restaurants, cabaret shows, etc. In short, everything a traveler wants to get, there is everything here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went into the place to eat, there are already many people here. Some people have already finished their breakfast and started chatting. From the point of view of dressing up, half are businessmen and the other half are adventurers or mercenaries. Therefore, Kim’s usual clothes did not attract the attention of others. He found a table and sat down, and ordered some simple food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The message should not be so fast. Jin thinks about this problem. He should go to other places to find a new channel today. This can correct the authenticity of the message. He has been behind for a while - if the goods were sold out on the first day of delivery to the town, he may have been behind for more than a month. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he will find it sooner or later, because he must find it back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you heard?" At Jin’s neighboring table, several people were finished eating and chatting. "The king of wizards in the north, the ruler of Tenny, Merson has been defeated. I just heard the news from the merchants from the north."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "This is really good news. I have heard such good news for the first time this year." One person replied, "What is good, just change a wizard ruler. It will be the same." Another person said disdainfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you have been to Senny like me, you will understand why I am so happy. No matter how fierce and cruel the new wizard is, he will not do it. It’s worse than Nelson. I think the people there will be happy to change a ruler.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You are all wrong,” the first The person speaking is inserted. "There is now a parliament to rule. It is indeed a powerful wizard who defeated Merson, but he did not replace his dominance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't make those terrible death towers?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, the wizard destroyed Merson and destroyed all his death towers. He even succeeded. Saved some of the people who were sealed into the tower."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is impossible." The other two people shouted almost in unison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be excited, the truth is that - at least those businessmen say so. After the victory, the wizard summoned the people in the city and told them that they could He decided to live his own life without fear. He destroyed the dark castle of Myerson in the face of everyone and destroyed all the death towers. After he had done all this, he left."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, if all this is true, I have to start believing that there is justice in this world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait, plus this one... There have been six wizard kings killed in the past two years." A person who had never opened his mouth suddenly spoke. "Is it true that this time the sorcerer King Merson was destroyed..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Glorious Master?" Several people once again said the name, then another silence . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Isn't that really a legend? I always thought that it was the characters that were imaginary by the people ruled by the evil wizard king. I don't know the name, I don't know the looks." I don't know the origins, I only know that he has powerful magic, and he is the messenger of justice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It sounds ridiculous. But if it is reality." A person drinks a drink. "That is very admirable. Don't say, everyone has a drink together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The legend is that he was the unnamed mage who died in the Central Tower and the king of the wizard two hundred years ago. It was that battle that changed this place. It became the big desert today."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold did not listen, after silently eating his own dish, he got up and walked out the door. The task of monitoring Lake has been handed over to the cone, and his task is to find another way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The street has just opened. For this town with few productions, business is the only way to survive. The hired workers are screaming hard, and the pedestrians are constantly being intercepted by some particularly enthusiastic businessmen, and they have to take a bit of tongue to get out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A variety of things, from the northernmost fur to the southernmost plateau jade, can basically be seen. Yes, this silver leaf town is located right on a big business road. According to the average person, it is a matter of time before it develops into a big city and then falls into the hands of a wizard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold observes both sides of the street, looking at the honest and honest businessmen, but God knows where the goods they sell come from? Maybe it was from a bloody desert gangster. Although the market is noisy, at least it still follows a certain order, and there are no disputes or violent conflicts. This shows that there is a force to maintain order. Usually this means there is a strong ruler here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A team of guards came over. Gold sideways to avoid. The soldiers in this team are wearing black jade-like steel armor - which undoubtedly proves his inference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldier had just passed, and a person who sprinted slammed into his body. This apparently urgent person apologizes and wants to continue on the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jin reached out and grabbed him, then pulled out his own bag from him. This thief moves really fast - ordinary people may not feel it at all. Kim did not yell and yell, but dragged the thief in his hand to the no-one lane on one side. Although the man struggled, it did not help. Soon, Kim dragged the prisoner into an alley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You...what are you doing?" The thief - Kim now noticed that it was a teenager - asked the trembling voice. He saw the tall sword of this tall stranger hanging from his waist. "Don't... don't kill me, you will regret it when you kill it... really..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is the ruler of this town?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The ruler?" The thief squinted his eyes. "Which one do you say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I mean, who is the most powerful person in town now?" Gold gave a little effort to make that small The thief made a cry. "Don't play tricks with me, I am not a patient person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know... Ah... I said, I said. It is Mr. Morley. He is the head of the town."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, who is the leader of the thief in town?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "It’s old Gangnai." The thief told me honestly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to see him." Kim took out a gold coin from his pocket and shook it. "If you are willing to lead the way, this is yours."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief’s face showed a complex expression, and it was obvious that he was considering the consequences of this. But that gold coin is really dazzling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s here." The thief pointed at the door. He turned and wanted to slip, but Kim grabbed him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go in together." Kim grabbed the thief in one hand and knocked at the door. Very unexpectedly, the door is just a cover, so it will open when you touch it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three people in the door, the middle is a very old man, and the other two are young people. The three men did not accidentally look at the two coming in at the door - it was obvious that they were notified before Kim arrived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hannah?" Kim understands the attitude of the three people from the middle of the old man is exactly what he is looking for. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's me." The old man nodded. He looked at the thief who was struggling with gold in his hands. "Xun, give me a roll, wait for me to pick you up again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where are you looking for me? It seems that you are not trying to do for the heavens." After the boy named Xuan left, Lao Gangna once again looked at the uninvited guest who was on the door. The stranger looks young and has a cloak that is commonly used by desert travelers. A protrusion in the middle of the cloak indicates that the person carrying the weapon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My name is Kim, I want to make a deal." Kim said straightforwardly, "I want to know some news."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why do you think I will tell you the news? Unfortunately, I am not an intelligence dealer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But it can also be intelligence Trafficker." Kim took out a piece of what he had won in the casino yesterday and put it on the table in the middle of the room. “My price is very good, and the information I want is very simple.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“What do you want to know?”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The whereabouts of a batch of goods. A few months ago, a caravan went south along the Central Business Road and was looted by desert bandits. The shipment was then sent to Silver Leaf Town." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your goods?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, but I have a thing in that shipment ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The goods will be sold off."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So tell me who is there Was dismantled."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Gangna looked at the things on the table and quickly made a decision. "I will come here this time tomorrow, I will give you the answer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have not said what the goods are."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," said Old Gangna. “The robbers have a site, and they also have long-term partners. All goods that have been looted on the Central Business Road are fixed to a black-hearted businessman.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Black heart businessman." Kim repeated this title, his face showed a smile. "Okay, I will come again tomorrow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked out the door, and soon after he found out that the little thief named Xu was sneaking behind him. The kid is very clever, but he can't beat him. He turned a corner and quickly stood against the wall. When I came over, I was caught. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you doing with me? Our transaction is over." Kim walked over. To his surprise, the boy did not escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. King..." The boy was brave enough. "Do you need a follower?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Follow?" Kim stunned and immediately understood. "Unfortunately, I don't need it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All travelers need a follower." The boy suddenly rushed up and grabbed the golden cloak. "I will be able to serve you very well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why choose me?" Gold pulled over the cloak. “There are a lot of travelers in this town.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Because, you... looks like a good person.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good guy? Is there a good person in the world?" Jin Leng smiled. "You are such a girl, it is dangerous to travel with a man. Especially strangers like me."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boy’s face turned red. Kim turned and went, but the cloak was caught by Xun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Please, take me out of here." She blushes, but her hands are not willing to let go. "If I stay here, Old Gangnai will sell me to the brothel. I just heard that he has already started this plan."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Then go home and stop being a thief."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I...have no family, no parents... I was old and just took care of me..." Whispered. "I can only help him steal things and lie when he is young..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't want to do that at all..." Xun - the name is obviously just who picked it up - suddenly burst into tears. "I don't want to be sold to a brothel..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold sighed. The lethality of tears is still valid for him. If the black cone is around, he must begin to blame him for his blood. There are so many things in this world that are cold, tragic and unfair, how much can he solve? But he couldn't hold his heart to force the girl to open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you take care of yourself? I don't need to travel."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold strolled around the market. By the time he returned to Lake's store, he had already purchased a lot of essentials for normal human travel. He walked into the door with his new entourage, and the black cone flew on his face and stopped on his shoulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, Kim, you seem to have got something interesting." The crow looked at the girl. "I didn't expect you to be interested in the little girl." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is my entourage." Jintou did not raise the explanation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Follow?" The black cone stopped at the shoulder of Kim, and looked at the girl in a condescending position. She wore a small sloppy dress and a small cap that blocked the sun on her head. If she didn't look at it carefully, she couldn't really see it as a woman—even if she looked at it carefully, it would be ugly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Crow...can you talk?" Xun licked his eyes and ears and could hardly believe everything in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Speaking politely, since you are his follower, you must call me Ugly Grandpa. Do you understand?" The black cone flew to the girl. "I am his mentor and companion, you have to call me that."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wu cone...uncle?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is almost the same." The black cone is flying back to the gold body. "I have to remember to call me in the future, otherwise you will look good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Call it as you like it." Gold interjected, "This bird I like to be touted."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is the situation." The crow asked softly. "That has already helped you to find out, now he is investigating your origins and purposes. I think he will make a choice within a day or two, telling you everything or getting rid of you."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have found another source. Maybe I should find another one, so it doesn't matter how Lake chooses us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I think this town is a bandit." The crow sighed. "The bandits always collude with each other."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Be prepared, we will leave tomorrow." Kim said loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where to go?" asked quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tomorrow will know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden let himself hide in the room, he himself Go to the counter and ask for another room. After the girl entered the room, the crow got to the ear of gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You made an inappropriate decision." "Now taking her is not good for us. And she is stunned and wandering around, indicating that she is not an honest and reliable person. Even if you really want a follower, you can't choose her."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold laughed and didn't answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Forget it, don't listen to the Ravens, and lose money in front of you." The black cone did not continue to pursue this issue. It will no longer be sighed with a sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Golden stayed in the room to prepare for his next trip, Old Gangnai was acting for the news he needed. Other aspects may be expected by Kim, but one thing is absolutely beyond his expectations. Because at this time, in the face of the old Gangna report, it was the leader of Lake who appeared yesterday, with a big scar on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lake and Old Gangnai are a group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's completely reliable. It's the survivor of the thief group. The Black Storm Robbers are no longer there, and everyone including the leader is killed. Only a few people who have gone out have escaped." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They have fifty people, although they are all in the rabble, but there are some good people."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But all died within an hour. Some frozen bodies on the scene, some people attacked them with magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sounds like a wizard, a wizard..." Old Johnna felt the beard and thought about the meaning of the word. "But the Great Desert is not the territory of any wizard. Is it true that Lake's guess is correct? The man named Kim is a wizard? Although he does look a little different, he is full of strangeness."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is impossible. No wizard will do such a stupid adventure." The young man who brought the news said. "Mr. Lake brought a new message. Today he sent his men to check out the luggage he left in the room, where he found some..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The magic crystal, the total value is more than 500,000 gold coins. Some of the crystals still contain magic, and the other part has been used. This fully explains the reason for his self-confidence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Gangnai's eyes smashed. He made a few unclear laughs. 500,000 gold coins, which is almost equal to the entire income of the whole town for one year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With the magic crystal, then he should be a wizard's men... even if it is not a wizard, at least it will be magic. We will treat him as a wizard for the time being. Even if you leave the old nest, the wizard is not good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But it is not impossible to deal with."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "And he is in the town, Morley will not allow this to happen. He is a strict ruler."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But that is in town. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What does Mr. Lake mean?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The town must abide by the rules of Mori, Outside the town is another matter. He has a good plan..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eagle stuck in front, whispered, the old Gangnai smile on the face The thicker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is really a good plan."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black cone tapped the gold with a mouth s head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, Kim, don’t you think you have been waiting for too long? It’s not a good choice to stay in the room... I guess that Lake is doing his best. To investigate your origins."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you think they can investigate?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "This is what I said, but I always doubt... forget it, I advise you to go on the streets and explore the tone of people. Maybe something has happened recently."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold seems to think of something, a rare laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it too boring to think of a room, think about turning around? Ugly?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Nonsense!" The black cone shot his head with gold and protested. "I am just thinking about you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, okay, it’s really not interesting to wait for Lake’s decision here, go out and get it by the way. Point bird food."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, don't make a mistake, I don't want to eat bird food, I eat..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dispute, Kim went out. The one person and the bird who were still noisy immediately quieted down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Would you like to bring your new entourage?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One person and one bird walked out the door. At about noon, there was almost no one in the store, only one or two occasionally rushed through. As mentioned in the previous article, the town is located on the edge of the desert. The sun is unscrupulously tormenting everything in its territory with its light and heat. At noon, the town has a high temperature to cook eggs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this does not stop people’s desire for money. The sun in the sky is so hot that the market on the ground is also hot. The business is the busiest time of the day. Everywhere is hiding the appearance, people in the cloak are buying things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few guards wearing black steel armor are patrolling. They are the only ones who don't wear a cloak. The black steel armor is obviously treated with magic, and even in the hot sun, the steel itself is kept cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Their bosses really have money." Ubisoft said enviously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden goes aimless along the street. He didn't plan to buy anything, so he didn't care about the voice of the businessman. Unconsciously, he found himself walking into a remote alley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Remember what happened yesterday?" Wu cone suddenly asked. "That little conflict?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are there those hooligans? Of course, remember, what happened?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing, just repeat it today."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Repeat...呃?" Kim recovered from the state of distraction. His front and back have been blocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His front is the one who punched him yesterday. It must have been heavy yesterday, because the man was covered in gauze. The man had a dagger in his hand, surrounded by three or four thick men with axes and iron bars. After the golden body, standing on several other figures, one of them is a half-orc known to each other, each one is fully armed and murderous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Say something." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello, everyone..." Kim looked at the front and back again. This time it seems to be different from yesterday, this time they are prepared - maybe even follow him all the way. "I don't want to find trouble."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man who was injured in the chin yesterday showed a smile. Perhaps because of the relationship of gauze, he looks very embarrassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-orc took a warhammer and he waved his weapon. "We don't want to bother," said the Orc. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That just happens..." Kim picks up the words, and if possible, it is better not to resort to force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We just want to let you die! Give it to me!" The Orc shouted and took the lead and rushed over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why is the result always like this..." The black cone sighed and flew up into the sky, letting Kim face the two sides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold has pulled out the sword. However, his position is unfavorable, and it is always dangerous to pinch both sides in the alley. If there are no special tricks, this situation seems to have no chance of victory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But gold is indeed a person with special tricks. "Look at you, dark wind!" he shouted, "Dark!". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-orc immediately stopped the pace of the charge and began to dance the hammer in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't see it!" The Orc madly danced with a hammer and shouted in his mouth. He was afraid that the enemy would take the opportunity to attack, and the result was to block the progress of his companions behind him. Kim turned and began to face the enemy on the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Paralysis!" Gold called for another power of the magic sword. A man who had just rushed to him in front of him was immediately fixed by magic, and his body stopped and stopped. Then Jin crossed the sword, and the sword shackles slammed into the other's brain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other one came over, he could have launched an attack before Kim played the power of the magic sword. But everything that happened just scared him, and the hesitation was very serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kim kicked a very easy kick and the person who has temporarily increased his weight by five times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Magic...Magic?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chin injured man made a surprised cry. The other few who were rushing up or planning to rush also stopped their own steps. Everyone understands what magic means. Darkness, horror, death, absolute power - mentioning magic, the first thing people think of is these words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Witcher?" Someone made this call. The magic that affects the Orcs has faded, and the other two are knocked down and climbed up. They all returned to their companions, and no one dared to rush again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to be over. Kim exhaled and the magic sword in his hand fell. As long as you add more strength, these people will be scared to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be careful, gold!!" A black cone that hovered in the sky gave a warning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? Ah..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A profitable crosses the crowd, squatting with gold I shot into his body at a moment. This is a powerful launcher with a powerful crossbow, which is powerful. The whole body that did not enter the gold, leaving only the sagittal tail shivering outside the cloak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gold bends down and the whole body shakes like a balance . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am overthrowing him... hahahaha... even if it is a wizard, there is nothing to fear... I shot him..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A burst of laughter came from the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gold seems to be unable to hold on, he leaned against the wall and supported the sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You're okay..." The crow fell from the sky and fell to the side of Kim. "Gold..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It hurts... or it will hurt..." Kim stretched out a hand from under the cloak, full of hands. "It hurts...hey..." He looked at his own blood, and his eyes slowly spread a fierce man who was afraid of the black cone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Get on, take this opportunity to kill him!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orcs rushed again, The scared black cone flew away. This time he succeeded. He rushed to the unsuspecting gold side, hammering his head to Kim, and hitting him like a cow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, the wizard is also able to bear this." The Orc smiled and touched the hammer - smashed it, let alone the head, the stone is finished. . He stepped forward and wanted to take the sword from his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body moved. No, not just moving. The dead body that had already died must raise the hand holding the sword, and the long sword penetrated the chest of the half-orc. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This change is so sudden, the Orcs have not even reacted. He struggled to look at the sword through his chest, and his face fell with surprise and unbelief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold slowly climbed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Up! On!" Watching a companion fall, these desperate people are red-eyed. The two sides rushed together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gold, restraint!" The black cone called in vain in the sky, but could not stop the white-blade battle on the ground. "Don't let anger stunned, you don't have to be angry... oh..." The black cone sighed and watched the energy bursting out of the foot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even if you want to kill, it's best not to use any magic... Hey, that's true..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; There was an explosion in the town. The sound was loud but did not attract the attention of many people in the market. Everyone is busy with business, and only a few people have looked at the source of the explosion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A full-bodied person stumbled and ran out of the alley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you calm down? Kim?" The black cone flew to the side of Kim and watched him pull his body out of the body. Kim’s face was twisted because of the intense pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good pain..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The pain of the body is just an illusion...you are still too I am not mature, I will not control myself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just..." Gold gasped and answered. "Not me... is another one in my heart... it is his anger."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is your anger that causes his anger." While looking at the few obviously unsaved guys, there were several dead bodies that were bombarded with magic. "The damage you get makes you angry...but you know it doesn't make sense to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The next time I will pay attention..." Calm from the intense pain. "What should we do?" he asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What should I do? Of course, I will leave soon. There is a rogue who has escaped, we have to leave before causing greater turmoil. I said, you are either simply Kill all, leave this one?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is already running away...no need to kill him."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A market turmoil. Some daring people and guards rushed into the alley. But at this time, only the body of the victim was left in the alley, and the injurer, the wizard, was gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Witcher...is really magic..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oops, there are wizards coming to our town If he started to make the death tower, we would..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, you must find the wizard, or our town will be finished."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many discussions in the crowd. Yes, now the wizard has not yet established his own power, and it is still too late to destroy him. If the wizard begins to draw magic from death, then the town can only succumb to the wizard's arrogance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The wizard should not run far..." People talked to each other and talked to each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Everyone listens, I know where the wizard is!" Someone stood up and shouted, and the voice immediately caught everyone's attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We must unite, now kill the wizard!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You ran Really fast!" When Jin walked into the door of the hotel, the black cone leaned against his ear and said. "Is the wound recovered?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A hotel's Ma Tong heads-on Come out, just across the gold. The young man looked at Kim with a weird look and then ran away. Although all this gold was noticed, it was not in the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Take it in the room today." Wu cone suggested. This suggestion is very reasonable. It seems that it is not a good idea to go to the streets now. "If Lec didn't look for us at night, we would go to him. If it doesn't work, go to your second line."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They both walked Into the room, as soon as you enter the door, the cone flies out of the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gold, you caused a sensation in the town. They treated you as a wizard." When the black cone flew in, shouted to Kim. . "Some people are starting to look for you, all of them are murderous."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold, but laughed, but did not speak. He leaned on the bed and looked at the mirror not far away with a very tired look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a stranger in the mirror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the room silently stayed for an hour or so, the black cone flew out again, this time when it flew in, the voice had already brought some surprise and anxious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gold, be careful, those people seem to be coming here. Their number is several times more." The black cone stopped on the shoulder of Kim. I slammed the golden face with my wings and woke him up from the state of ecstasy. "Be careful, they seem to know that you are here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the third time, the black cone brought outside intelligence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gold, I think we still go outside to avoid it." The black cone shouted in a very serious tone. "They are not looking around, but have a purpose. I think they already know that you live here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, my name is Xia Xun... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't have to bring the girl, it's both trouble for you and for her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"I promised her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold stepped out of the room door and then rang the door of the entourage. The girl only came out to open the door for a while, and squinted at the same time. It is obvious that she was sleeping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Clean up, we have to leave now." Kim said concisely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now?" The girl couldn’t react for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, now. Go away immediately, leave Silver Leaf Town." Kim suddenly remembered one thing, he went straight into the door. "Right, I remember I have a sundries bag here." He looked around the room and found his bag right away. The tie of the bag is loose. Perhaps with the curiosity, his new entourage has opened the bag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hurry up." Kim rushed to collect the bag while urging. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quickly packed up a bit. A noisy voice came at this time. The sound came from several doors outside the hotel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oops...they act faster than I expected." Kim thought about it. "Xun, don't leave the door, leave the side door, first Outside the town, I waited for me on the top of the hill on the south side of the town. I will come right away. Move quickly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl promised to run out, After a few minutes, the black cone flew back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She has left safely, those people have not stopped her... But what are you going to do now? Somewhat strange, there seems to be no one in this hotel. I didn't see anyone else going out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The sorcerer lives here!” The person who led the way shouted, “He is inside!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Get out!” The crowd burst out with indignation. Call. But after all, they are faced with a wizard, so no one dares to rush directly into it. People surrounded the hotel and some suggested arson. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Smoke the wizard out!" someone shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More and more people. Most of them are residents living in the town. Like all places, everyone hates the wizard. What weapons have begun to appear, and some people even pulled in a few guns. The soldiers who kept order were mixed in the crowd, but they did not intend to stop the riots, but instead helped. People have begun to ignite torches or prepare rockets for oil immersion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is coming...coming out!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this voice, noisy crowd Quiet, watching the stranger in the desert cloak slowly stepping out of the hotel. This person is tall and tall, except for his eyes and feet, his body is covered by a cloak. His shoulder stopped a crow that kept beating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He is a wizard!" I don't know who called the first sound, and then there was a wave of anger in the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You, you misunderstood, I am not a wizard." Kim tried his best to suppress his voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He lied...see..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A man with injuries was held in front of the crowd by several people, and Kim recognized that one of those hooligans who attacked him. The only one to escape. He really shouldn't let this one go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kim reached out and slowly pulled down the face of the cloak. His hand was shaking slightly - it was too excited. But what kind of feelings make him excited? he does not know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s him, he attacked us with magic." The wounded suddenly came to the spirit, broke free from the people who helped him, and pointed at the gold. "It is he who uses magic, he is a wizard!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am a magician!" Kim interrupted the wounded. "And you attacked me, I just defended myself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the voice of the people overwhelmed the sound of gold. And, even if everyone listens to him calmly, what good is it? He may be the last magician in the world. How many other people know that there are still magicians in the world? The wizard is just a branch of the magician, an evil branch. In this era, the magician and the wizard are equal in people's minds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The evil wizard, everyone started!" Someone cheered up the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you going to do?" The black cone was asked at the golden ear. "Kill them all? Or come to a wonderful one and turn the town into gray."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No...they are innocent. They There is nothing wrong with doing this..." Kim answered, his hand clenched his fist tightly. He was surprised to find that he was desperately self-restraint. "I still..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Escape with magic?" asked the black cone. "Seeing no, the crossbows in the hands of the soldiers are all magical weapons. If you use the flight to escape, you will shoot like a bird. If you want to use space magic... I suggest you better. Remember the transmission that came here? Your error is so big that the burden of the last fight on your body is far from recovering. I bet you can't finish the magic. Even if it's done, it can't be transmitted much. It will be caught up immediately."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do I do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" killed They, these idiots are simply not worth your pity. Killing them is easy, you know your power. In addition to space magic, other magic can be cast freely! Even you can use... that, even with this town ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No!" Gold whispered but resolutely refuted the views of the black cone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That let me see how you can face it all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Flying into the sky, laughter is full of praise and joy. Of course, this is just a crow's laugh, and humans can't hear what it means. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A flying arrow came on the face, passing by the black cone and wiping off several of his mane. Scared the black cone and quickly fell back to Kim’s shoulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "All this has nothing to do with me. Kim, hurry, find a way to get me out of here, I don't want to be a rotten crow by this mob." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You just said that I can't use space magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now the situation is stronger than people Come on, it’s enough to send me away!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold ignores the scream of the black cone, and he begins to observe the crowd carefully. People are watching him too. There are no crossbows or bows and arrows, and no one is rushing with weapons, but Kim knows that these will happen sooner or later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sooner or later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold slowly scanned the crowd. There are so many people, and it is very difficult to get out. And from the attitude of the crowd, unless they really kill a large number of people, they will not shrink because of fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought about a few techniques of getting out of the way, but each one was vetoed by himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The thief first smashed the king?" He looked at the crowd, and from the face of the people, he saw their leader. It was a fine middle-aged man with a crossbow in his hand. This person is dressed in a very ordinary dress. Kim judges that he is not a businessman. He should be the leader of a local aboriginal. Other people, although they are also very loud, basically do not dare to advance with him to maintain a baseline, even those soldiers. Most of them are standing behind him. After all, they regard gold as a wizard - the wizard is not a good enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly noticed. A child rushed out of the crowd and ran to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ana?" Kim finally recognized the child. When he came to the town, the naughty little boy he accidentally rescued from the sand trap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Return, be careful..." There was a shout in the crowd that worried about the child. The little boy was unmoved and ran to the front of Kim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is you, Mr. King?" Ana looked up at Kim's face and saw the soft voice that made him feel at ease. "And your pet's black cone?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey! Kid, I said you have to call me Mr. Umbrella! And I am not a pet!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ana, come back, he is a wizard, an evil wizard." Kim saw the leader with an anxious look. In his heart, he suddenly found that the little boy and the man looked alike. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go back." Kim said lightly, "This is not suitable for children."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Are you really a wizard?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Although it’s very similar, I am not really a wizard.” Jin smiled a bit. "But you are leaving soon. Your father," he pointed at the leader. "I won't listen to my explanation. We have to get one soon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The little boy ran away from the gold and ran back to his father. Kim couldn't see what he was talking about, but he did hold the man's hand and kept his mouth moving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The magic of attacking with a point of spirit...when they are shaken, they can achieve their goals without hurting them." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why don't I use some of the magic of the explosion? I will stun them and not be hurt." Kim decisively rejected the Ugly's ambiguous idea, "that Things can't be done."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conversation between father and son has come to an end. The father who pushed the child into the crowd and then walked over here, still holding a crossbow in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you really not a wizard?" The man walked to a position not far from the gold and asked aloud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really not," Kim replied. "I am a magician."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a difference between the two."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I Not building a Wraith Tower, and not interested in ruling others."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you do use magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The source of magical power is many, not just relying on the Tower of Wraith."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't understand..." The man stared at the gold "But you don't seem to be really malicious. Otherwise you won't save my son, and for a long time here, you didn't use any vicious magic. But I can't take risks." He said loudly, let yourself The sound is so loud that everyone can hear it. "If you swear to leave our town and never come back, then you can leave safely."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The gods testify, I will leave the silver leaf now The town, and will never come back." Kim quickly made a vow. He walked outside the town, and surrounded him to give him a path. Some dirty things were thrown from the crowd, but Kim passed through the crowd without any reaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We can't let him go, this wizard will definitely come back for revenge!" Someone ran to the front of the leader and expressed his opinions loudly. "Hey, he just came, he hasn't made a death tower..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shut up. He has been here for two or three days, and he has to build that thing long ago. It’s not a simple character... If we play here with him, I don’t know how many people will die.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people follow gold I have been seeing him out of town. But it is also the entrance to the town. They watched the wizard leave them, and in the shadow of the sun, this lonely figure left a long shadow on the slope of the hill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kim did not say anything, nor did he sort the cloak as the black cone said. He just walked silently, and went to the top of the hill to stop. Looking at him from this position, the entire Yinye Town is unobstructed. He could even see a lot of people gathered at the door of the town - these people were watching him with vigilance. But the distance is so far, they can't see him anymore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hurry up, so dirty, I can't stop."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold off The cloak, the things attached to it are smashed down. He stood on a high place and looked at the town under his feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you thinking?" The black cone stopped on his shoulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was thinking...maybe everything in the past will be turned into nothing." He looked at his hand. "Human magic will never fall...forever Nothing can be revived. People have been deeply rooted in hatred of magic. This skill will forever disappear..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, anyway, the origin of human magic is high. Fairy. Even if it disappears, it doesn't matter. Once again, learn from the higher goblins. If you don't develop again, you won't have it? But it has been thousands of years." The black cone laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said serious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am also talking about seriousness." Stop laughing. "The ancient magical kingdom created courage and wisdom, and also cultivated the power of hatred and yuwang. When our morality is not enough to control yu hope and hatred, the death knell has already sounded. This is nothing to be sad, human beings are self-sufficient. The curse eventually destroyed the Holy Light Dynasty; the development of the Pluto Law, the use of the Wraith Tower eventually made the human magician extinct from the earth; the wizard seemed to be a parasite on the big tree of magic, they were born of magic. But it devours the big tree; but it doesn't matter. As long as it is the result of human behavior, there is no need to stop it or be sad." It sneered. "If human stupidity really endangers the world, the gods will give us sanctions for extinction!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You...too cold."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter if you look at it, isn't it?" The black cone continued to laugh. "It's your feelings too rich. I said gold, don't think about those things." Now, we have to face some new characters."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold turned back and saw a group of people appear behind him. The leader he knew - it was Lake. Among them, there is another person he is familiar with, old Gangnai. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two big men are catching Xun. The girl’s headscarf was removed, revealing a long hair. She struggled, but it was impossible to break free from her strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you come to fulfill your promise?" Jin asked. "I know that you have already investigated the news I want."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I didn't really think you were a wizard!" Although Lake said so, his face still With a smile. This expression clearly shows the truth. He knew everything from the beginning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is you let those people come to me?" Jin asked. "There is one left in the hotel... I can only have one explanation for this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The correct answer." Lake replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But I am not really a wizard..." Gold whispered. "And I have vowed to leave here forever. But our agreement should still be effective. How is the shipment going?" He paused and looked at the girl who was still struggling. "And, let her go, she is no longer a thief... she is already my follower."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not very smart "Old Gangnai picks up the mouth." On the one hand, I asked for intelligence, and on the other hand, I pulled my hand down. No leader would allow this kind of thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you need compensation? Well, let her go first, how much I can give you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Gangnai made a move Color, the two people let go. Xun ran to the side of Kim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold looks at his face again to Lake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know the Thousand Lakes City in the South? The goods were all packaged by a thousand Lake City people and shipped away two months ago. If there are no twists and turns, It is estimated that it has arrived."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now you can go to Huangquan Road, you can feel at ease?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three people rushed up and held weapons in their hands. They surrounded gold in three directions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I said that I am not a wizard." Kim explained again that his hand had held his sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think so too. If you are really a wizard, you have already started in the town."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then you...A..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A burning sensation came from the back and passed through the skin to the bone marrow. Kim’s body swayed and then his feet slammed down. He barely turned his head and watched his entourage pull the bloody dagger from his back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know that you are not a wizard, you can use magic because you have magic crystals... but you really shouldn’t let those things be seen Those things are really expensive, expensive and can make anyone tempted." Lake said while checking his nails in a casual tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Xun..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female assassin stabbed the dagger into the back of the gold for the second time Even before the dagger was pulled out, the dagger was turned a little bit to cause a bigger wound. She looked at the owner with no expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah..." This blow brought more pain than the first one. The whole person fell and the body twitched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And, you shouldn't be so kind." Old Gangna smiled and added. "To be honest, a good old man like you is really rare. I know that you must add magical defense to your body... so I specially prepared a magic dagger for you."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good people are rare, because they all die very fast." The girl sneered at the third time to pierce the dagger into the gold heart. She is no longer a previously frightened and pitiful look, and the disguised pigeons turn into vultures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why..." Kim struggled to ask. The black cone flew away from his body and flew in the sky anxiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why? Don't you still see it?" Old Gangnai asked in a horrified tone. "Do you think that the assassin who is as good as this child will easily give up? She is really good, has helped me to clean up more than one trouble. The results are not related to gender."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it a scam at the beginning?" Kim struggled to ask. A man came up and the sword slammed his body down. Although Kim wanted to dodge, he couldn't completely escape. The sword went straight through his body and stabbed into the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah...the shoulders...the shoulders are going to fall off..." The blonde screamed in pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Kim, you better not hide, so you can end your pain quickly." Lake smiled and looked at this bloody scene. The blood flowed out of the cloak and dyed a large piece of ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gold!" The black cone flew down, stopping at the gold and twitching. "Control your mood, don't be angry." It is so concerned and even forgets its own safety. A net bag ran up and set it up. Then one hand grabbed it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A talking crow? Really rare, you can burn a pot of soup." The man holding the black cone smiled viciously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don’t eat me, I swear you will regret it. I have constipation, hemorrhoids, tumors... Help! Gold... Don't eat me... I really It's not good!" The black cone was thriving, but he couldn't get rid of the powerful hand. The corner of his eye saw another sword penetrating the gold body. This time I pointed at the heart. Kim’s body does not move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s rare, I think it can sell for a good price." Old Gangna said. He picked up the old eye and looked at the black cone. "How does this bird give me? Lake?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's just fine. But you'd better go find a cage...ah!" Lake exclaimed . There were scenes that he could not have imagined. The man named Kim was nailed to the ground by two swords—one through the shoulders and one through the heart—and actually climbed up from the pool of blood, and even pulled up two swords that went deep into the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey... you said no anger, then how do you let me face it all, with a happy mood? It hurts..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one is holding The cone man was also scared by the appearance of gold. His hand was loose and the crow flew to freedom immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It should be a little happy. You have to understand that these people are just clowns in front of you. Their various schemes are so ridiculous in front of you... Do you Shouldn’t you laugh? With a calm mood, it’s like watching puppet shows. Puppets think they are very smart, but they don’t know that every move is controlled by others.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crow re-stopped on the head of Kim and pointed his wings to those who had no other movements because of being overly surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are higher than their existence. If you are angry, at least you must be angry with things that are equal to you? These clowns are in front of you. What? It’s just a game. Come, be happy, even if you want to kill, you have to smile on your face.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The killing in Goldeneye is slowly Calm down, a smile appeared on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are right, Ugly." Gold whispered. "It's just a game..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Get on, kill him, what are you doing, go up!" Lake issued an impatience command. All the people rushed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Lake, I remind you. You made a few mistakes." Kim stood straight and shivered past the few people in a hurry. "First, Although I am not a wizard, I can't rely on the magic crystal to perform magic as you said." He reached out to a Lec. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The hot blast!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame flow emerged from the void in front of his hand, Forming a pillar of fire, swallowed the man in an instant. The beater was too late for a wailing, and the human body suddenly became a charcoal strip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Second, I didn't use any defensive magic, so you don't use magic to smash the capital."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold said, while the spurs of the female assassin. The girl was too fierce, so she didn’t take it. Obviously, she is good at surprises, not real fights. Kim pulled out one of the swords piercing his body and cast it on the girl. The whole action is done in one go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sword pierced the body of the entourage from behind. The swift body swayed a little, and made a low sigh, and fell down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Third, although the magic crystal is worth the money, but it must have life to enjoy it! The power flowing in the atmosphere, turned into my anger . . . The wind from the north of the frozen earth, the end of all things..." He whispered a spell, the temperature in the air dropped rapidly, and before anyone could escape, the temperature had dropped to an unacceptable level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ice!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician walked slowly and came to Lake and Laogang In front of Nai. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Help... cold..." Both of them have been covered with frost. The flesh and blood body has been frozen and frozen, and two people stand like ice sculptures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fourth, this bird is very rap, I am afraid I can't sell a good price. Goodbye." He reached into Lake's face. Lake couldn't even make a last scream, and the body fell into a place with a lot of broken ice in a crisp sound. "And you, old Johnnai. Your assassin is really excellent," he said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second broken sound is heard. Then there is more...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, hello, gold, what did you say? Say I have a lot of tongues?" The cone flies in the sky, following Kim’s footsteps, repeated and bickering. "You have to apologize to me and apologize for your rudeness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where am I wrong?" Kim looked up at the crow. His face has no serious indifference in the silver leaf town, replaced by a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
