			<div id="content">At dusk, the setting sun casts the last rays of light on this beautiful hillside. The grass reflects the golden sunlight, making the hillside look like a golden coat outside the green underwear. There are two young people in their 13-year-olds who are enjoying the rare scenery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Long time no see, Mi Mi, I haven’t come to this hillside recently to play, your mother must be very strict with you."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No way, my mother always wants me to help her with housework. Today is free, I can't pull her to this hillside to play!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A girl with long brown hair smiles at the strong black-haired boy in front<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here is only here The secret place we know 喔"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, Ken?",<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" He last lost with me more than wrestling, very unwilling, now I am practicing, ready to challenge me again!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Ken's personality is too Seriously, but you are really amazing. You know, the village chief said that Ken is definitely a good seed, willing to pay for his Warrior Academy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Warrior Academy, say it, another month, three of us Deciding on the future. Ken will probably go to the Warrior Academy, and then he will be a soldier and live a thrilling life. Right, Mi Mi, what are your plans for the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Girls show a charming smile, "Gold, it is polite to say what you want before you ask others."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I, I Is it going to go to an ordinary school to learn the skills of the blacksmith, and then become the blacksmith of the village, so that the villagers should not go to the town if they want to repair things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "It's a realistic ideal, but your physique is a good fit for a blacksmith. Hercules!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, let's talk about your ideals now. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl smiled and ran away, "Don't tell you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jin Jin, "Don't dare to play with me, don't run." Say to catch up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two personally smiled and rolled down on the slopes covered with grass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Ah” girl suddenly cried, “What is stabbing me, it hurts!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; When the two stopped fighting, the meter had already flowed blood on the hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What," the girl’s eyes stared at a necklace hanging on the golden neck, a rather strange necklace. The pendant of the necklace is a circle with a six-pointed star in the circle. The six corners of the six-pointed star protrude from the circle. It is these six corners that break the girl's hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This, it was the mother-in-law of the village who gave it to me. You see, this is a magic item, just open it." It is divided into two faces by a corner of the six-pointed star. One face is as smooth as a mirror, and the other face is engraved with a few words. "Align the smooth face with yourself, then read the mantra, and there will be your own. The image, as long as you don't read the spell, the image will not disappear, it's amazing!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really? Let me try."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, although my mother-in-law taught me several times, I just can't remember those swearing mantras. If I want to try it, I will only go to my mother-in-law." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mimi disappointed to put the pendant down, "No, my mother told me not to go to the village mouth mother-in-law."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Why, mother-in-law is definitely not a bad person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't know? Mom said that the mother-in-law at the village is a ! Women "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;"? Why "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;"This is the case," Kim glanced at the magic necklace on his neck, his face showing a disproportionate expression on his face. "However, her mother-in-law is really pitiful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't say this, yes, why did she give this necklace to you? Magic necklaces are quite valuable things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen In this sentence, Kim’s face suddenly turned red, and he remembered the scene when his mother-in-law gave him the necklace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This necklace is for you, this is a must-have item between lovers. Just put your sweetheart's face on it, no matter how far you can see it. The appearance of a lover, no matter how long apart, can feel the existence of the other party."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mother, I can't accept such a valuable gift."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Silly child, Mi Mi is a very good girl, and Ken is also a very strong opponent. If you don't work hard, you will be taken away, well, don't Blushing, holding this necklace, confesing to Mimi early, then printing her image on it, there is no chance in a month...."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No reason, yes, how is your hand?" Kim tried to open the subject. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s okay, you see, the blood has stopped." The girl raised her wrist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mimi!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A month later, we have to choose our own future and enter different schools. Maybe we can't meet again for a long time, so, there is one thing I will tell now. You."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"???"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mimi, Kim!" came under the mountain A string of calls interrupted what Kim was about to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A blonde teenager is running towards the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ken, I thought you are not coming today!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"H,ha "Hai," the blond teenager gasped and said, "There is something unexpected today."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What?" The two men were unanimous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Congratulations to me, the village chief just told me that I have been admitted to the Warrior Academy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Congratulations!" The girl jumped up happily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there still a month to take the exam?" Kim had some doubts about his happiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The village chief recommended me in the name of the village, free of admission!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Great ", the future generals!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't say this, I have not become the general's ambition." The blond boy showed an embarrassed expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, okay, gold, in order to celebrate Ken's entry into the Warrior School, we will go home today and go home again."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 The individual started running in the sunset. Kim ran at the end, and in his heart, there was a little regret - if he was willing to come later, he could confess to the US. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trainee magician woke up from the state of squatting, shaking his head and trying to drive the sleeper out of his mind-----any trainee magician is using the wind Wings (a low-level flying spell in Wind Magic, which can only determine the altitude and direction of flight when cast, suitable for long-distance travel) will be fatigued after three hours of flight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How many miles are there from home?" Jin Xinli thought, there are still three to five hours. From the last time I went home, I have passed five more times. Years, the distance of the road can not be remembered. It’s really strange to think about it now. He wanted to be a blacksmith and he is now a magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The magician is an unpromising industry," a person who lined up at the Warrior College registration office explained to him,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Warrior Academy entered the school from the age of thirteen, five You can graduate after the year, and you will be eligible to join the army after graduation. If you are successful, you can be promoted from a trainee swordsman to a swordsman or knight at the age of 22, and you can become a swordsman or a senior knight at the age of 30. If you are 40 years old, you can become a Juggernaut or a Paladin. These two titles can't be obtained by losing effort on the lost continent. If you don't have a talented teacher, you can't reach it in your lifetime. At the age of thirteen, the graduation time ranges from eight to fifteen years. Once graduated, it is just an ordinary trainee magician, and the average age of the magician is forty years old,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;No fifty-year-old can hardly become a great magician (the great magician is the limit of the average person, and the high title is rarely achieved except for the talented person). It is difficult to become a priest before the age of sixty. Or a sage, want to be The Magister (this title is not granted by an organization, when your power reaches an unbelievable level, others will automatically call you this way) is at least 80 years old. Not to mention the magician wants It is weaker than the warrior. A magician who has studied for 13 years can't beat a warrior who has learned five years of swordsmanship. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turns out that it is no wonder how much People want to be magicians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Kim was planning to line up at the Skills College Registration Office, he just saw a person registering at the Magic College Registration Office, and he was surprised that Kim could not help him. The problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This," the young man who looks like a rich child’s family replied, "You are really a countryman, even this does not know, from the Skills College." If you graduate, you can only be a craftsman in your life. If you become a warrior, it would be too difficult to get out of the crowd. 'One will become famous, and one of the 100 people will have a lucky one to survive and return home. Others are buried. The corpse is gone. But the magician is different. If you don't want to join the army after graduation, you can go home. You can study magic at home slowly. Unlike a warrior, you can never improve your level without participating in actual combat. So the magician is the safest, once passed. With the exam of the Great Sorcerer, you can immediately become a person who is eager to invite and get a very high social status. In the event of a war, the magician is also the most protected unit on the battlefield, with the least chance of death. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I heard that the magician is quite weak."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"like you This countryman certainly does not know , "The other side made a helpless gesture. "As long as the magician has enough time to recite the mantra, a magician can kill ten warriors (author's note: before the trainee wizard finishes the mantra, a trainee swordsman can have enough time to kill ten trainee magicians) "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the conversation between two people, several people joined the registration team of the School of Magic. Unconsciously, Kim became a member of the registration team. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, Paine, come here for the exam tomorrow." The man who talked to Kim promised and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Next",<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"───"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Next"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"───"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Hello, what is your name? "I was impatient and shouted loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gold standing still was shocked, "Gold, Kim*Cali."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Local?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gold*Cali , Rohr City, well, come here tomorrow to take the test, "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a minute, I..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Next"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't stop the road, boy", the person behind is impatient, push the gold away . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Helpless, after returning to the Skills Academy for another name, Kim returned home, and even dared not tell the parents about this matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as you don't take the exam, it's okay." Kim said to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, Kim bid farewell to his parents, carrying his luggage, and bringing tuition fees into the city. (According to the custom, if you pass the exam today, you must go to the college immediately. And his parents think that the son passed the exam is absolutely no problem). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold deliberately avoids the location of the Sorcerer's College exam, but can't escape the fate of the arrangement (author's arrangement). Just as he was about to reach his destination, a man dressed in a black magic robe came face to face. Kim recognized the person who was registered at the Magic Academy yesterday. "You are not Kim * Cali? Wrong, the test location is over there, come with me." Speaking, he grabbed Kim's hand, and before the gold reacted and opened his hand, the magician read it. The mantra, a faint smog surrounded two people. After the smog disappeared, Kim Desperate found himself between a group of magicians and people who are about to become magicians. (This magician is performing "instant movement", one A fast-moving spell that can carry others, but only to where the caster is familiar, and the distance limit is determined by the caster's own magic level). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s impossible to escape the exam. Kim can only consider how he can deliberately pass the exam in order to get out (he dare not ask the wizard to leave ), a tall master began to count the number of "one, two, three, four...", then he said to the companion "just right!" Then the children waiting for the exam said, "I am very lucky, the college is here." The city only enrolled 25 students, and the applicants were exactly 25 people. Therefore, he added the tone of the last sentence. "You can avoid the entrance exam!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "What," Kim felt that his head was heavily beaten. Before he had time to stop it, the seven wizards began to read the same mantra, and Kim had just heard the mantra. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold and everyone else is surrounded by that kind of smoke. When the smoke spreads, he finds himself in a big square, surrounded by a Two thousand people of his age, and many magicians wearing magical robes. A magician is talking to them. Kim has never seen anyone who is so loud (magic sound, using magic to enhance the sound, not a kind of magic is just a little trick). "You new students, hello, welcome to the Magic Academy. From now on, you are a member of the college..." Kim has no intention to listen to those welcome speeches. He ran to the entrance of the square, hoping to be crowded. When you are in trouble, leave here and go to the Skills College entrance exam. "Nobody will pay attention to one more person or one less person anyway," Kim said as he ran. Although there were several people at the entrance but no one stopped him, Kim ran to the outside smoothly, but he immediately stopped and watched the abyss under his feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Magician Academy is surrounded by mountains and above the cliffs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold and dull turned around and heard a speech in his ear "........The School of Magic is a place of abilities, as long as there is enough capacity. You can graduate at any time. The graduation exam is very simple, as long as you can use your strength to leave the Magic Academy without any items, that is, if you cross the Chirimai Mountains, you will be eligible for the trainee magician if you graduate...." "....... In order to let everyone study magic, not to be disturbed by the outside, the students are not allowed to communicate with the outside. If you want to go home to visit relatives, just wait until after graduation..." "..... Finally add one sentence, In order to be equal, all students who do not have enough money to pay tuition can work as an assistant in the research department to pay the tuition fee. Well, the speech ends here. For new students, please go to the left to collect daily necessities and check the assigned dormitory. .......". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, Kim Kali, a man with a blacksmith's ideal career, became a student at the School of Magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, fate is really tricking people," the trainee magician Kim recalled the past, sighed in a sigh, in order to keep the mind from being invaded by the demon, he only I can use the method of recalling the past. I have to fly three hours away from home. If I fall asleep, although the "wings" will not be lifted without thinking about the mantra, it is not a joke to hit something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold took a slow pace and followed the flow of people to gradually collect the daily necessities. He was almost completely desperate. He just explained to several magicians with a cry. In all cases (he can't care about the fear of the magician), but the magicians can only express sympathy. "Sorry, child, this kind of thing you should say before coming here, the college has strict regulations. Institutions, students are not allowed to leave school after enrollment, don't worry, when a magician can be much brighter than a blacksmith." In the case of no help, Kim only accepts the reality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although after a week of adaptation, when the first day of class started, most of the students were weak and leaned on the table. In fact, if you can energetically attend classes, there is only one gold in class F (according to the ability of students at the time of admission, It is divided into A, B, C, D, E, and F. In addition to knowing that there is a skill called magic in the world, there is no knowledge of magic. Class E knows some basic knowledge of magic. Other classes are pressed. Such push)The teacher also felt boring. Only one of the three hundred and fourteen students was listening to him. The remaining three hundred and thirteen were all furnishings.After saying a few words, he felt that he should teach in accordance with his aptitude, so he said to the students, "Today, stop here! You, yes, you, stay", he pointed his finger at the strong image. Maverick student<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I?", Kim was surprised, because in his memory, he never offended the teacher. In fact, today is his first time To this teacher<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your name is Kim, Kim *Cali, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" ", Kim has not been surprised by the ability of the magician to remember."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I heard that you came to the School of Magic in an accident, and thought that when the blacksmith is better than the magician, in order for you to get rid of this mistake. Thought, I decided to specialize in tutoring you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah! ! ! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next few days, the gold that had nothing to know about magic finally got a general understanding of magic (all one-on-one education) Method of blessing)The so-called magic is actually the skill of exerting inhuman power. The root of magical power comes from the elves and the gods. Therefore, it is not a few words to cast magic.To cast magic, you must first have a contract with the gods or elves (in fact, the Elf King is also among the gods).The contract is an agreement between the magician and the god or the elf. Through some rituals, the magician can exchange ideas with the gods or elves, ask for power from God, and are willing to pay the price.In general, God will pass a prayer to the magician. After the ceremony is completed, the magician can use the power of the god to meditate on the prayer.The exchange contract is not as mysterious and terrible as some people think. In fact, there are very few real things that God asks the magician when exchanging contracts. Usually, you are required to not believe in hostile gods and ask for your daily behavior. It is necessary to do according to God's teachings, etc. - it doesn't matter if you don't do it. God won't punish the magician who violated the contract.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mantra is a method of transforming magical power. For example, using the power of Vulcan, you can use a different spell to display fire, fireball, and violent , fire wall, dissolve, hell fire, fierce fire, etc.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical power that magicians usually say actually refers to the degree of loading on magic power. Everyone has the limit of magical load, if you display your own load capacity. The amount of magic, which is extremely dangerous to the caster, but the level of magic can be improved through continuous practice.At the same time, it takes a certain amount of time to meditate on prayers when performing magic (especially for beginners of magic)Therefore, although the magician can do many wonderful things, it is not a panacea.A magician must perform the following steps: First, meditate on the prayer and let himself be in a state of meditation.Second, let the magic fill the whole body in the state of meditation, and then return to normal state.Third, read the mantra and release the magic in the way you want (for the lower level magician, the first two steps take time, and the time required by the advanced magician to cast the spell is mainly used in the third step)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strength of the magician depends mainly on two aspects - the size of the total magic and the amount of magic released per unit timeThe former can only be improved by repeated exercise, and the latter can be improved by learning higher spells.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The days at the School of Magic have passed day by day, and Kim has begun to feel that being a magician may not be a bad choice.The School of Magic is a fairly free place, and the school’s constraints on students are small.The course is divided into three parts, a meditation class (exchange contract with gods or elves), a spell class (learning magic spells), and practice classes (improving magic)Learning is very free, there is no name, no time limit, it doesn't matter if you come to class (the author's little thought)Every September, a graduation exam is held. Any student who has confidence in his or her strength can participate (the content of the exam has already been said before)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Kim gradually forgot his thoughts of becoming a blacksmith, his life has some unpleasantness.Probably Kim has to go to the research department to work, there is not enough time to communicate with the students, a guy named Brett has become the enemy of gold.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright is said to be a famous person, as if it is a son of the Marquis, anyway, the family must have money and strength, he is taking four departments to study.In the first year, under the encouragement of homesickness (early graduation early to go home), almost every student studies hard, so Jin and Bu Laite have nothing to do with evil, and when they meet, they will also pay tribute.But in the second year, after the feelings of homesickness faded, some yo! The children are not doing business, including the Brett.The aristocratic children pay attention to eating, drinking, and playing. In the School of Magic, there is nothing to change about eating and drinking, so I have to pay attention to it.In this way, bullying classmates have become these embarrassing! Children's greatest funAnd Brette and his friends, after making some people, turned their targets to Kim.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Isn't that famous poor gold? I met again today."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A guy like you who doesn't even have a meal at home, come to the Magic Academy, go home and farm."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The poor egg magician, hahaha! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright and several companions are laughing at the gold, but Kim does not say a word."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Call you poor, see if you are not convinced, come and teach him lessons!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One The man began to enter the state of meditation, and Kim recognized that he was a student higher than the fifth grade.If it is an ordinary student, you can only escape quickly, but Kim is not, a year of magic education has not let gold develop a habit of relying on magic for anything.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold rushed up and knocked down the guy who hadn’t started to curse. The other couples saw that they couldn’t deal with gold with magic, and they rushed together. But Kim has a physique that can become a blacksmith. They are not able to deal with the power of the magician from an early age. After a melee, Kim finally knocked all the people down to the ground. At this time, the shouts attracted. teacher<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final result of this conflict is that everyone is locked up for one day, the old guy has two incisors, and Kim’s face is caught. A few red marks, one eye of Brett was beaten, and the rest of the people were more or less commemorated.Since then, Brett hated to die, although he did not dare to find the trouble of gold, but under the threat of their group, no one dared to be close to gold.Perhaps it is the blessing of this matter. In the next few years, in addition to magic, Kim has nothing to do. In the third year, Kim became the first in the same grade.Kim has experienced resistance to mathematics, doubts, acceptance, love, and finally developed into fanaticism. He runs all the way between the driving range and the library. He has been completely attracted by the infinite mystery of magic.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After five years of study, Kim believes that his strength can already challenge the graduation exam, he signed up in the graduation exam that year, surprised him However, Brett actually signed up for the graduation exam, and his grades are not outstanding, even worse.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trainee magician thinks of the graduation exam that he participated in that year, and he can’t help but be proud. This is the first time he used magic to face the challenge, and he won.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As stated in the lecture at the time of enrollment, the content of the graduation exam is to leave the Magic Academy - leave with magic<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold stood on the edge of the cliff, took a deep breath, behind him was a magician, he was the invigilator, the task was to guide the direction and rescue in times of crisisNot far from other candidates, everyone is as nervous as he is, except for Brett.The relaxed appearance of Brett is enough to make people think that he has been in and out of the college many times.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exam started, almost every candidate used the magic of "wing", because this magic can not fly freely, but only consumes magic when taking offEveryone has the magic to meet the unknown challenge, and the invigilator follows<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone’s expectations are not wrong, not long after the departure, a blizzard in the mountains blows and blows everyone away.After the snow storm, Kim completely lost his direction (because the "wing" can only control the direction at the time of departure, even if the direction is changed by the external force, the caster can no longer turn), he looked around, except the invigilator Outside (the magic of these teachers is "flight" and "tracking"), other candidates have not seen one, the invigilator is pointing to the right side of Kim, Kim knows that he has been biased to the left.No way, gold can only land first, then "wind wing"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold began to understand why it would be a graduation exam to cross the Chirimai Mountains. He is already using the "Wind Wing" magic for the eighth time. The snow blew in the direction, and because of the need to maintain body temperature, he had to use the "dissolving" (the ice-magic magic of the dead face, used to resist the cold and release the ice magic, but only a low-level magic) this magic, he began to feel The magic in the body is not enough (Author's Note: Although the magic actually refers to the level of the magician's load on the power of God or the power of the elves, when a magician's load reaches the limit, he will feel more and more difficult to concentrate. It seems that some kind of power in the body is getting less and less, so the magic is called magic instead of stamina.)According to the invigilator, Kim has not yet finished flying halfway.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold understands that the "Wind Wing" is used again to reach the limit, and according to the invigilator, there is still a road ahead of the storm zone.Instead of spreading the magic to a few "wings" magic, it’s better to fight, and Kim has made up his mind.After he applied a "dissolution", he began to cast a magic, a magic that consumed all his remaining magic. "The elf of the wind, please obey my orders, please accept my request, guard with your power. I am not harmed by the enemy"This mantra surprised the invigilator. This kid dared to cast this intermediate magic "guardian wind" (this magic can protect the caster from the wind and affect it, is usually used to fight poison gas) Or continuous defensive spells of wind attack)The invigilator’s surprise is not unreasonable. At the gold level, even if it is in a normal state, it can only be used two or three times. This is quite good at the level of the students. If used now, this magic will make Kim used up all the magic, and once he had an unexpected situation, or when the guardian wind disappeared and then ran into a blizzard, Kim had to withdraw from the exam.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At dusk, everything is over. In this graduation exam, a total of 465 students met the requirements, and the remaining two hundred people failed. Most of the students avoided the most densely populated areas by going around the road and passed the exam smoothly (only the incomprehensible gold used a straight forward approach). At night, the graduation ceremony was held in the barrel town. All the graduates got a suitable magic robe as a gift to become a trainee magician. When everyone was immersed in joy, a teacher announced a   ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apprentice Magician Kim recalled five years ago, it is a bit strange, how can Brette be the first to arrive, now want to come, probably cloth I bought the invigilator and bought it. I only thought that his luck was particularly good. He didn't even encounter a blizzard. However, it does not matter, anyway, gold is not the second. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the second day after graduation, there were many people in the barrel town, all of whom were lobbyists from various countries, and each booth persuaded these graduates to join. army. As far as the magician is concerned, the newly graduated trainee magician actually has no value in actual combat. Just find a soldier and you can easily kill him. However, in the war, just give the magician enough time. Casting (obviously, this can be done by other units in the army), a magic can often destroy a considerable number of enemies, so the magician is an important force in the army, even the trainee magician army is also very welcome. At the same time, a newly graduated trainee magician is insufficient in magic, skill or experience, so they often worship a master with a strong mana to further strengthen their strength until they can pass the magician exam and become a one. Magician. And those high-powered mages, if they do research at home, often hate being disturbed. If they are taking risks, they are not willing to bring a burden (it is really cumbersome), and they are rarely willing to accept an apprentice - except those in the army. Magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the army is a young magician who just graduated (these really rich and powerful aristocratic children certainly don’t have to go to the army, naturally there are fathers and mothers covering ) Their first choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold is not opposed to joining the army, but he wants to join the army of his motherland, the Gavteval kingdom, but the army of his homeland is not lacking in magicians. . Although Kim spent five years at the School of Magic, he also heard about the current hidden war crisis on the surface of the mainland (which is why countries are trying to expand their army). He is not willing to participate in an enemy that may be enemies with his country. army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold chose to go home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go back to see your parents first, and later on later," Kim comforted himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the way home, everyone looks at gold with a different look--a group of adventurers with a magician is common, but only a magician, Moreover, it is obviously a trainee magician (the magician has obvious characteristics between different levels, the trainer can only wear the magic robe, the magician can wear the magic hat, the magician can hold the magic wand, the priest and the priest have Magic jewelry), this kind of thing is not common. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the flight, the trainer Magician recalled what happened when he first graduated from home. He felt a little funny, and his father’s reaction was a bit too intense. That day, he was full of emotions that could not be expressed in words, stepping into the house, the small but the only grocery store, he was already excited and could not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello, guest, what do you want?" The father did not lift his head, he was accounting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dad!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"──", the old shop owner Punk Kali slowly Raised his head and recognized the young man in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gold!!!" Father excitedly forgot his age, skipped the counter and held the gold in his arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is it, so noisy?", Kim's mother came out from the inside, but she immediately made the same movement as the old punk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old couple are happy to embrace the eldest sons who have not seen for many years (they have two sons, one daughter, but Kim’s younger brother and sister have already gone to school), constantly Ask the cold and ask warm. But this did not last long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, where have you been in the past few years, I have asked people, you are not in the skills college."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Magic Academy?!", Kim's father's face sank. In his mind, the magician is a liar who plays tricks. It is a heinous profession. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter if you don't learn the skills, you can inherit the father's grocery store." Dad's words erased Kim's five-year efforts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night, Kim was unable to sleep in bed, and his parents explicitly asked him to abandon his pursuit of magic and went to be a grocery store owner. But Kim has fallen in love with magic. He believes that magic is already part of his life. After half a night of thinking, just this evening, he left a letter, carrying the backpack he had just carried, with travel essentials and some money, and secretly left home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apprentice Magician Gold is still a little scared when he recalls his own reckless behavior. At that time, he had nothing, no companions, no strength, no experience but bravely went to the unknown. In the world, he was very simple at the time. He only wanted to find the legendary great magisters and asked to be their disciples, so as to have a glimpse of the mystery of the magical hall. But did not think about it carefully, why those big magisters should accept him as a disciple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The population of the lost continent is about 600 million, of which about 500,000 magicians. Among the 500,000 magicians, 400,000 are trainee magicians (there are many aristocratic children who are not aggressive), 80,000 to 100,000 magicians, one to three thousand great magicians, fifty-six priests and priests. But there are only three big magisters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is Raymond Sordo, Dick’s court magician. In the early winter of 1987, a large-scale bandit group invaded Dike, although the Dike Kingdom sent troops to enter the squadron, but because the maneuvering force of the infantry with the infantry could not compete with the bandits composed entirely of cavalry, it could not catch up. Bandit army. The bandits burned and plundered along the road, causing great suffering to the people of Dick. A month later, although the bandits were dragged down by a large amount of materials, they still led the snow-capped river that Wang Guojun arrived at the border one day. This river has three seasons of ice, which is named after it, and is ready to cross the river with thick ice to escape to the neighbors. country. When the bandits tied the straw for the horses to prepare to cross the ice, they saw a magician across the river. The magician cast a layer of ice in the eyes of the river, on the river nearly 80 meters wide. The river is mixed with large pieces of crushed ice and can't go or take the boat. The bandits had to change their way, and the result was caught up by the kingdom army and the whole army was wiped out. This magician is Raymond Sordo. Since then, he has become the court magician of Deco (he is a Deco), and he has also won the title of the Great Magister. He is considered to be the first magician in the mainland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is the master of the Great Creator, the owner of the Stone Tower. In 1979, an island suddenly appeared near a small fishing town in the western part of the mainland. Two months later, a seven-storey solitary tower appeared on the island. This has become news of the entire continent. Later, people realized that it was all done by a magician. This magician is repairing * grams. He raised a piece of seabed with magic, formed an island, and then used magic to pull a tower out of the rock, a tower that exactly met his requirements, all in order to have a place where he could quietly study magic. To this end, he won the title of the great magister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third is the court magician York Ray of the Rete Empire in the East. In the battle for the throne of the Leite Empire in 992, he defeated the entire magician unit (including forty grand magicians) and won the title of the great magister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold does not want to worship Raymond Sordo as a teacher, he is not willing to work with Brett again, and the Reiter Empire probably will not allow a trainee magic. The teacher entered the palace, so Jin decided to ask the great concealer to repair him as a disciple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Stone Tower is not far away, it took Jin spent six days to arrive. He spent the night in a hotel in the city. The next day, he got up early in the morning and used flying magic to easily reach the stone tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Someone?" Kim said loudly, he had fantasized about the entire teacher last night:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Someone?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Opening the door) "Who?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Is the big magician repairing the gram?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am, what are you looking for?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am a trainee magic gold*Cali, I hope to be your student!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(The following is a long and eloquent story.)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that you are quite good, okay, come in"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;........<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now Kim is acting in the script. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Someone?" Kim was a little shaken, it seems that the other party does not know the script of Kim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Someone?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"......."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Someone?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"......."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kim couldn't help himself. Since the other party didn't follow his script, he had to make some moves beyond the script. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold hard knocks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When King Kong knocked on the first, and the hand had not come back, the door made of sleek granite made of magic was silent. Sliding open, showing an unknown space to the uninvited guest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold was shocked by the suddenly opened door. He immediately read "I would like to ask..." according to the script, but he immediately discovered that it was not the old one he imagined. The door opened by the mage. The door is opened by myself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Someone?", Gold tempted, but as just now, no one answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apprentice Magician found himself clearly in the wrong direction. This is definitely not the way he went home. He has never seen this wood. He has read the mantra of the "wind wing". "The elf of the wind, liberate your strength, let go of my body, rely on the ancient contract. In the name, he ordered to leave, and then he slowly fell to the ground. I originally intended to keep myself awake by recollecting the past. I didn't think that I was too immersed in the memories. The result was unconsciously blown by the wind and I didn't notice the direction. Kim discerned the direction and applied the wing magic. "The elf of the wind, I rely on the power of ancient contracts, summoning 汝, etc." Immediately, he flew in the sky again, although he planned not to recall the past, but immediately remembered the past because of boredom, he and the big The magician repairs the scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden dare to walk into the Stone Tower, there is nothing special on the first floor, except for some tall stone statues, almost nothing. "These are the sculptures of the repair!", Kim said to himself, it is hard to imagine a magician would like to carve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After carefully observing the statues, Kim carefully walked up to the second floor, the second floor was the reception room, or it looked like a reception room - a A fairly large table, a circle of exquisite chairs, of course, is obviously made directly from the floor with magic. There was a very beautiful crystal ball in the middle of the table, which brightened the room and exudes a strong magical power, so that the trainee magician who came in came up with a hairstand. "I really didn't think there was such a powerful magician in the world." Kim now clearly knows that the power of the master here is far more than any magician he has ever seen. If he repairs him as a thief, he can die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold while going to the third floor with a proper apology in his stomach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third floor is a library, the six-row bookshelf looks dazzling, so many magic books, and most of them have not been seen in the college. Kim couldn't help but tempted and took a golden magical book of Phnom Penh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold is too late to open the magic book, a huge force passed from behind, without any precursors, even without a curse, in gold Surrounded by gold before any reaction, Kim dropped the book and turned his body in the extreme panic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of him is a tall magician, looking angry, the powerful power is sent by his wand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is the big magician repairing *g! Kim rushed back in the extreme panic to recall the apology he had just prepared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes.......", even "not sure" did not have time to say, repairs launched a mantra. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power around gold is transforming his body from a living body into a mineral, and at the same time, the whole body of gold cannot move, and no magic can be used. In fact, even if it is free to cast spells, gold cannot be transformed into the fate of stone. Escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the gold is completely desperate, the Great Magi has stopped the mantra, and he has determined that this uninvited guest will not pose any danger to himself. Interrogated. He was satisfied with the effect of his magic - only the head and the upper chest did not turn into stones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are you?", repaired and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am a trainee magician gold, gold * Cali, I am not a thief, I came to be a disciple, because the door is not locked, I just read the book There is no meaning of stealing." The gold is stuttering, the words are unsatisfactory, and the foreword is not finished. Although the effect of petrification has stopped, Kim clearly feels that the terrible power is still around the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nonsense! How can a trainee magician open the magic lock of the tower without knowing it, and avoid the bandit guards on the first floor without any difficulty? (The bandit is a movable statue made of magic. Although the combat power is not high, but the perception is strong, and when it is destroyed, it will produce a big sound.) "A threatening gesture was made," he dared to lie to me. I will make you regret for a lifetime, say, who are you? What are you doing here? Who sent you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold immediately feels the energy around I am still in a hurry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't lie, I just came to the teacher." The voice of Kim brought a vibrato. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big magister looked at the captive in front of him and began to use magic—a his own perceptual magic. Through this magic, the big magister knows that there is no such thing around. A companion of an uninvited guest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't think that dressing up like a trainee magician can lie to me, I will let you know how powerful my power is." The big magister began to read another A mantra "reading mind" (reading mind is an intermediate magic, but its effect varies from user to user. The average mage can only read the most obvious consciousness of the other party, so it is often deceived, but at the level of repair, Read the deepest consciousness of the other party). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s weird, you are really a trainee magician," and the face of the repair has eased. "And it’s just graduated."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where is the mistake?", the big magician was immersed in contemplation. "Why my defense agency has not worked, there has never been such a thing before." But he immediately returned to God. , relieved the magic of gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold has a little physical activity, his goal has not been hit hard, since the misunderstanding has been eliminated, then everything will come to fruition, he did not think why The repairer will use the bandit guard to guard his tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment intends to send away this nascent shackle, just like sending someone who used to come to the teacher. Suddenly, his mind flashed, yes, it must be. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What magic items do you have?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Think more carefully."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This magic robe may have some accompanying magic. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not it"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Right", Kim took out since the acquisition Unused lovers necklace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's it!" The big magister looked at the necklace and said slowly, his face changed, joy, love, happiness, sadness, pain, and many The expressions that Kim could not distinguish were swept one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't expect you to come back to me after so many years." The Magi tutor muttered to himself, he took the necklace and opened it to Indistinguishable voices read a few spells, the smooth side of the necklace slowly emerged a portrait, an extremely beautiful girl, and the other side appeared a line of words "give to the favorite Jessica - repair * grams ". Jessica, Kim vaguely remembers that the old woman at the entrance to the village called the name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
