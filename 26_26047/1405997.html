Without any interrogation, Göller already knows the purpose of the adventurers. For him, it is enough to give a lesson to these daring human beings. In fact, once Glor and Kim met, Kim could be dead, because Geller also vaguely remembered the appearance of the cursed magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold is now treated the same as the half-orc who is in the same team as him. Kim is in a special team, and all the bundles in this team are half-orcs - except gold. The half-orc warriors who escorted this team did not care for their compatriots. The half-orcs who were tied were all wounds of the whip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They used to be warriors of the Wild Bet Corps, but now their status is no different from those of the captives. The reason for the current situation is only because they are back on the battlefield. The mad beast regiment has steel-like discipline. If there is no command from the king of teeth, all those who dare to retreat will be regarded as deserters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this discipline is well known, although they are all trained fighters, but when there is a terrible ice snake that cannot be defeated, There are still some fighters who cringe, and they turn and flee the terrible Warcraft. Now they have to pay for the timidity of that moment. The King of Tooth is absolutely not forgiving those soldiers who are afraid of the enemy's retreat. The reason why they are not immediately executed is that they are to be taken back, so that their families are shamed, so that they can play the biggest role. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every morning, these half-orcs will be brought to the front of the army and openly smoked 30 whip so that every warrior knows to dare to be on the battlefield. The consequences of escape (fortunately, gold is not subject to such care). The terrible fighting power of the Wild Bet Corps is maintained by this cruel discipline. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold and these half-orcs were tied together, and he witnessed the cruel torture of these deserters. The spiritual insult is even more terrible than the torture of the flesh. All those comrades in the past, in the same team, are now spitting and insulting them. Because of their performance, they have been ashamed of the troops they were in. When distributing spoils, those teams with deserters can only be assigned to the poorer part. Like all the kings of the teeth before him, Göller is the team that fights heroically. The army of the half-orcs is compiled in decimal. When it comes to rewards, it is also divided by small teams. There are special performance exceptions. ) It is not a pity, but he will not let go of those deserters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The triumph of the escaping of the deserters is the upcoming triumph. This time, to achieve such a big victory, there is no doubt that it will be held in a triumphant manner. In the triumphal style, they have the only chance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although being a deserter who has no status more than a captive, the half-orc still hates humanity. Therefore, in the days of these half-orcs, Kim can be said to be a crisis. Fortunately, these half-orcs now have no extra energy to persecute the gold, and Kim also sees this. Kim tried his best not to clash with them, and finally avoided a lot of disputes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kim is walking in the last of the team, and now with the farther away from the center of the Orc Wilderness, the sun has converged a lot, although the sun is still Strong, but it is already within the tolerance range. However, it is not the sun that is now tormenting gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last time the beating damage was now fully reflected, compared to the half-orc’s fist, the damage caused by the feet of their iron boots is even more terrible. The magician was not only suffering from the flesh, but his internal organs were also hurt. If Kim is an ordinary magician, if he does not have such a strong body, maybe he is now finished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Kim, the only hope he escaped was to get rid of the strange handcuffs on his hand in an unobtrusive situation. However, this hope can be said that there is no chance to achieve it. Except that the half-orc is very strict, the pain is plaguing his body and spirit all the time. He has no energy to find a way to get rid of this handcuff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the night of the second week when Kim reached the half-orc’s main force, the gold was lying in a corner of the tent as usual, and the half-orcs were lying full. The entire tent. During these times, in order not to conflict with the Orcs, he was always in this corner during the break. Just as Kim was going to sleep, several half-orcs opened the curtains of the tent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is better to say that it is a living body that is more suitable than a human being. This person has not been moved since he was thrown on the ground. In the silence of a piece, only the weak, intermittent Breathing also proves that he is not a corpse, he is still struggling on the death line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one orc looks at this new one, only Kim climbs over, although he is almost self-sufficient, but he is willing to make every effort to help one Difficult friends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold turned over the unmoving body lying on the ground, glaring at the moonlight coming in through the curtain, Kim found out that he was lying on the ground. I thought Wei died in the black storm! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei’s armor that has never left is already taken off, and his body is full of countless scars. The tired wound is telling the fierce battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold checked Wei’s body, there are two places that are really deadly, one is the deep wound caused by the sword into the right lung, and the other is a The bite of the wolf, located in the huge torn mouth of the flank, both are fatal wounds. Although the other wounds are not very deep, the bloodshed is enough to make an ordinary person die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Wei is still not dead, he is still struggling with death, this struggle has been going on for several days. It is not so much because of the rigorous exercise in the past that his vitality is better than that because the unfinished mission in the heart gives him a strong will to survive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter how powerful a warrior can't fight with thousands of enemies, even Wei. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The few orcs who throw Wei in are telling the other half-orcs the horror of this human warrior. Even if a person is surrounded by thousands of enemies, he will not surrender. In the siege of the enemy, he used only one long sword to take away the lives of nearly one hundred wolf cavalry. This kind of martial arts is known as not afraid of death. The half-orcs are rare. Therefore, when the warrior was finally defeated, General Gera did not cut down his head, but brought back the dying man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although every half-orc thinks that this human being can’t live for a long time, because the injuries he suffered are too serious, but to their surprise, Although this man has always seemed to be dying, but he has not died, he struggled to survive without any medical treatment, and even Pluto could not overcome his will to survive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Wei is still alive at any time, in fact, his situation is much better, the wound on his body is no longer bleeding, most of them have already It is cruel, because of the environment of the half-orc wilderness, his wounds are not infected, so as long as he can continue to support, he will certainly survive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold can't help sitting on Wei's side, the only thing he can do is to feed the unconscious Wei with a little water. Because it is now out of the center of the wilderness, it is necessary to begin to restore the physical strength of the captives, so the water is no longer regulated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At dawn, the whole team is going to move forward, but Wei is still lying on the ground, he is still unconscious, but now he is alive and a miracle It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orc guard came over, he can't drag the whole team's departure because of one person. For him, this unconscious human is a nasty burden. If the team is late, he will be punished. If it is a person who can't leave, then he is useless. It is better to solve him on the spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guard took out his Tomahawk, this is his favorite killing weapon, the axe has the power to turn the enemy off, and watch the blood of the victim Spray is his favorite scene. He pointed Wei's neck with an axe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he has not come and cut down, the body is pushed away by a force, and the axe is therefore empty. The person who pushed him away is gold. He has not taken care of his situation. In any case, he can’t look at Wei and die in front of his own eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because there was no preparation, the guards took a few steps back and forth, and he turned and looked at the magician in front of him with an angry look. "What do you want to do!" The tone of the voice clearly stated his true words "Do you want to die!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can't kill him! He is still alive !" Golden drums have the courage to answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop! How do you kill him!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey! If he can't go, of course I have to kill him! But if you must I don't mind throwing him here and slowly die!" The cruel words spit out from the mouth of the Orcs. For him, the life of these captives is no different from the ants. He wants them to die. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am going to take him away! This is the head office!" Kim knows that only this method can save Wei. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh?" The guard looked at Kim, because he also looked out, Kim is also hurting himself, quite weak, "Do you really want to?" That's okay! He can live until you can't move!" The reason he promised this request was not because of tolerance, but because he wanted to see the desperate expression that he dared to offend when he finally couldn't move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 02<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Kim knows what the real state of his body is. Take off - more precisely, strip it off - the armor's Wei is not really heavy, but for the current magician, it is already close to the limit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maintenance of the gold is the half-orc guard, precisely because he always walks in the magician's side with no good intentions. He is patiently waiting for Kim to fall to the ground, but because of his existence, Kim has been persisting. It is because of the existence of a huge threat around him that Kim has not fallen. Perhaps as long as the guard lost interest in the watchdog, the magician would fall to the ground along with the people on his back and then dragged forward by the rope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hands and feet and the brain are completely numb, and in the heart of Kim, there is only one thought left - stick to it and take another step. In this state, Kim miraculously persisted to the afternoon of this day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guards are finally impatient, this mankind seems to be going down anyway, but he just can’t go down, he’s not waiting for the good show. Staged. So he went to Kim's side and kicked his foot to Kim's foot. At the moment, under the overload of activities, gold has been numb and even dodge is impossible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician fell to the ground like a big leather bag, and the wounded on his back also fell to the ground. However, this team did not stop because of the last person's fall, and still proceeded. Therefore, Kim was dragged forward by the rope on his hand, and he could not help Wei on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the gold at this moment is already desperate, then the next moment there will be something that surprised him. After playing a few rolls on the ground, Wei actually slowly With two hands up from the ground. After a few days of coma, this shock turned out to be a catalyst for his wake-up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brain is so messy, what is this? Where are you now? There was still a snoring in the ear, the hands and feet were sore and weak, and the pain was everywhere in the body, especially in the right chest and abdomen. The deep pains in these two places overwhelmed the burning feelings of other parts and made themselves I can hardly stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brain quickly recovered some of the reason. This feeling, right, is this feeling! Now this weakness and pain reminds him of the past, this is the second time. The last time was this feeling, it was the feeling after the failure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only difference between the two is that the last time he got up from the cold rock, this time he got up from the hot gravel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a part of the memory in the mind, and now Wei began to think of himself and the wolf cavalry fiercely tossed, and the last scene he remembered was that his sword had not yet When I pulled out from the body of a wolf, another wolf rushed up and slammed myself into the ground, and later did not know. Since I can still move, since my body can still feel pain, it is obvious that I am still alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We stand straight in the body, and in front of him is a huge team, he recognizes that this is the army of the half-orcs. "Is it a prisoner?" Wei said to himself with a voice that no one could hear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It hurts!" Because it stood straight, the abdomen now has terrible pain. This place is accidentally wounded on the wound in the past. Similar pains at the time began to provoke the bloody memories. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei did not resist, because he also knew that all the resistance now is useless. The Orc quickly connected him to the team, and he was behind the magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Master... People, are you going in the wrong direction? We should go north!" Looking at the old Locke, who was absent-minded and used his fingers to tease the baby, Lev could not help but ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, that's right! Believe in the experience of an old man!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But half The orc army is not in this direction!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't make a mistake! I want to let you go back and pay to bring you the way! If you don't believe it Me, then give me two hundred magic crystal coins right away, I will leave immediately!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't misunderstand, Mr. Locke! I just made a comment... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the two men talked, Behan noticed that the old Locke had scraped some moss from the ground and he took a bottle from his body - I don’t know what to put in the bottle - put the moss in the bottle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing?" Babe asked if he was waiting for Behan. "Grandpa, do you want to use these mosses for medicine?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!" Old Locke replied, "Little girl, you remember, all the things in the world contain the power of magic, just use the corresponding power. Processing, you can trigger these hidden forces. Remember my words, this will help you after you become a magician!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Magician? Is it like a magician brother? But I can't magic?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Locke smiled and continued to tease the baby, he did not answer the shell Beibei’s question, Babe did not ask. The baby has only been sticking to Babe, except for Babe, others don't care much. But I don't know why, this little animal and old Locke are very close to each other, and it is very happy to play with old Locke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They finally left the ridiculous half-orc wilderness, and gold finally set foot on the half The orc, the land that humans call "the bitter cold earth." It is indeed barren here, especially during this winter, and there is a chill atmosphere everywhere. There is not much greenness on the ground, and a few trees have now lost their leaves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speed of the march was significantly accelerated. After a 12-day trip, they finally reached the capital of the Orcs, Cyril, in the words of the Orcs. This is the meaning of "God of War". The army is about to enter the city in the morning of tomorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, the whole city of Cyril was silent, and all the residents - who had long been the winner of the victory of the king of teeth - came to the city In the doorway, all the men carry their weapons, while the women wear the most beautiful clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The barracks of the barracks opened, and a group of half-orcs came out of the barracks, which was Geller and his personal guard. After seeing the king of their teeth appear, there was an earth-shattering cheer in the whole crowd. All the half-orcs used their loudest voice to call the name of the king of the tooth. The men waved their weapons on their heads. From a distance, it was a sea of ​​weapons, as if all, one thousand seven. Millions of orcs have come here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without anyone's command, the Orcs automatically form a passage, a passage that is almost the same width as the gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing to enter the city is of course the king of the tooth and its guard. The half-orc welcomes this young king of teeth with the eyes of worship. They stopped, and everyone opened their eyes and gave him a glimpse of his style. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the small queue of the King of Tooth, the half-orc elite mad beasts, they marched in a neat queue, accepting the masses along the way Cheers. Some bold children ran into the team, trying to pull some hair from the hairy rhinoceros or the wolf, as the cost of showing off to their companions. As the army marched on the ground, the lions and cavalry in the sky also flew into the city, and they tried their best to slow down and waved to the crowd cheering below. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I arrived at the captive team. In the half-orc guards, the prisoners who lined up in two rows and marched at the pace of the embarrassment appeared in front of the masses. At that moment, the hatred of human beings accumulated for thousands of years broke out at once, and a whirlwind of various vicious words broke out among the half-orcs, violently blowing on every prisoner. The Orcs waved their fists and weapons to the captives, spit them in the most frivolous way, and insulted and threatened with all the words they could find. The guards had to push away the crowds who were too excited to prevent them from harming the prisoners—these slaves were about to be auctioned and could not be harmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deserters entered the city at the end of the prisoner's queue, and they were also the most enthusiastic "welcome" team, if they were only speech-oriented for the captives. Insults and threats, the deserters are really threatened by the human body. For the half-orcs, these deserters are more abominable than humans. Therefore, the first thing that welcomes them is the stone rain thrown by children. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two adventurers can be said to have been hit by the fish of the pool, with the rubbish stones flying like a raindrop to their team, both of them have a lot of . With the excitement of the emotions, with the high voice of the screams, the emotions of the half-orcs began to get out of control, and some weapons began to fly in the stone to the team of the deserters. As time goes by, more and more weapons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 03<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greek advances in the fear of the half-orcs, the entire team Behind him, his goal is very clear, the center of the city of Cyril, the Temple of God of War. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the awe of the god of war, the half-orcs rarely call the name of the god of war, they use another name - Siri - to call the god of war. The reason why this Cyrillic was not destroyed in the half-orc civil war was because of the existence of the Temple of God of War, the city was the only city that had never been reached by the fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregor at this moment is moving forward with uneasiness. He does not know how the priest of the temple will meet him. When he came to the temple last time, no one would pay attention to him. Although he has become a king, the priest of the god of war has not opened for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temple has always been the third force to rule the half-orcs, and has never changed. He is the backbone of the half-orc spirit. For the half-orc, the king of the tooth or the patriarch can only give himself the right to serve the official position or wealth, and the honor can only be given by the priest of war. This kind of system is also an important reason to promote the half-orc's brave and good warfare. No matter how high the weight of a half-orc, if he does not get enough combat power, the God of War priest will not give him the title of honor, but honor, the half-orc It is said that it is an important wealth that can be passed on to future generations. It is the key to determining whether a family is a famous name. If the priest of warfare gives a high honor, the king of the tooth (or the patriarch) will never turn a blind eye. There are several unwritten rules in the army of the Orcs. The position of the officers is arranged according to the level of honor. of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the spiritual aspect, the temple also has an important task of preserving knowledge and developing knowledge. Every progress of the Orc civilization is almost related to the temple, so it is fleeing After this land, the first thing the Orcs did was to rebuild a Temple of God of War. After the failure of the war with humanity, it was because of the temple that the half-beasted talents preserved their knowledge and culture, and their civilization did not regress in the melee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the most important thing in the Temple of God of War is their role on the battlefield. God of War did not give the priests the power to fight directly with the enemy, but the priests can use a lot of auxiliary power. In history, only the mad corps has joined the priest. It can be said that there is no mad corps joined by the priests of God of War. The root is incomplete, there is no prestige of the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greek is sure that the Temple of God of War has already known his glorious victory, but he is not sure whether this victory will allow the God of War Priest to recognize his position. Although he has already reached the throne of the King of Tooth, but the status of Geller is still not stable. This instability comes from two aspects. One is that some people still have doubts about his ability. The other is that the temple does not recognize him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although Geller is essentially unwilling to launch a civil war, things are not as simple as that. Although he got the hammer of the god of war, after so many years, the hammer of the god of war is just a legend. The aristocrats of all tribes who have mastered the rights are not willing to listen to the hammer of the god of war but have no background and no experience. When the hairy boy is said, almost no one recognizes his status. Existing profit-seekers must protect their own interests, and they will not pay attention to a guy who suddenly emerges, even if he has the hammer of the god of the gods certified by the temple. Göller only accepts reality - only force is the only way to convince those guys. In this way, Göll became the first king of teeth in history to rely on the civil war to gain the throne. It is precisely because of this that the temple did not recognize his position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as Geller stood at the door of the temple, he was hesitating when he wanted to knock on the door. At this moment, almost all of his subordinates are now watching him under the long steps. He can't knock on the door with his own identity. - The door is open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest of war gods dressed in plain robes opened the door, and they have been arranged into two welcome queues according to their status. Everyone took their canes and bowed to the king of the teeth at the door with a respectful attitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greek's men burst out with a burst of cheers, they know that their king of teeth is now finally recognized by the God of War priest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greg entered the temple, and this place was the first time he walked in from the main entrance, not to mention the popularity of so many pastors. At the end of the queue, an old half-orc is standing. He wears a robes that are not separate from other priests. However, it can be seen from his appearance that he will never be an ordinary priest. Göll knows this immediately. The half-orc should be the chief priest of the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chief priest opened his mouth with a slow, low-pitched word. "Welcome to you, the king of the tooth, may the glory of the god of war bless you forever! Since this temple was built, you are The first king of the tooth that came to you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priests used a special melody to sing the song of blessings of God of War, with the door of the temple The collective songs slowly closed, and the half-orcs outside knew that the priest of the gods of war would soon hold a blessing ceremony for the king of teeth that could not be seen by others. They were waiting quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original very ferocious guards now also reveal their loyalty to the side, They tried their best to protect the team, and the turmoil finally subsided. The two adventurers were so lucky that they were not hit by any one weapon. They were only beaten by the stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlike other prisoners, the team of adventurers was finally brought into a place that should be a prison. There is no difference between a half-orc prison and a human being. It is only dirtier and stinky than human prisons. But the adventurers and other half-orcs at the moment are happy to have a place where they can temporarily isolate those fanatical masses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-orcs outside began to revel, because the army began to take out part of the spoils to the masses. Every half-orc knows that this carnival is going to last for several days. Entering the city is just the beginning of the triumphal style. Tomorrow, there will be more programs waiting for them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ceremony is in progress, the hammer of the god of war is placed on the altar, it will As a medium to let the god of war come, God of War will directly teach and bless this new king of teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the sky is completely dark, the door of the temple opens again, and Geller appears at the door of the temple, and at this moment he holds the hammer of the god of war, the whole body The top and bottom exudes a very striking light in the dark. Suddenly, the "Long live" shouts rang throughout the city, and Geller finally completed the rituals that the kings of the dynasties had to pass, and now his position is unshakable! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While accepting the cheers, Geller slowly walked down the steps. As he walked down the last step, his guards immediately surrounded him. He sat on the beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Prepare for tomorrow's celebration!" This is the only order that Geller has issued. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the entire arena is packed, just today, to celebrate the tooth The victory of the king is triumphant, and a grand gladiator performance is about to be held here. The gladiator has always been an indispensable gift for the bloody goddess of war. Every time a celebration, this bloody battle is not less, the only change is the scale of the fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two teams of human beings were placed in the center of this arena. They were wearing a blue team and wearing red, no armor, just everyone A short sword that is not very long. There was a burst of threatening screams in the audience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a huge iron box on both sides of the arena. In front of all the orcs and humans, two leather bags with syrup were placed. These two iron boxes are inside and then locked. Two keys were immediately thrown into the ditch, and the other one was placed on the ground in the center of the two teams. The humans of both teams were forced to drink different poisons, and their antidote was placed in the box on the other side, and the key in front of them was opened and could not be pulled out in the lock. That kind of, that is, if you want to live, you only get the key, and then open the box where your antidote is. However, only two teams in the two teams can survive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two teams came together and they wore different colors of clothes so it was clear that each of them belonged to the team. Because they did not want the Orcs to see themselves killing each other, the two teams each launched a representative to discuss the ownership of this key. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold looks out inside the dungeon, he can see the situation of the two teams quite clearly. The Orc kept him and Wei alone in this dungeon, and they have been kept in this dungeon since they were taken to the arena. Kim is cheering for the secrets of his compatriots and cheering for them. No matter how they can, they can't let the Orcs look good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the audience is in a quiet moment, Kim can hear the vague voice of the representatives of the two teams. This is a difficult negotiation. You know, they are convincing each other to give up their lives! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 04<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is almost no space on the VIP seats in the audience, all nobles with heads and faces All came, but there was a seat in the best position, no one was sitting, and those who stood because they were late did not seem to be sitting in this space. This is not to say that they think they are standing more clearly, but that this position does not belong to them. This position is prepared for the owner of this gladiatorial performance, which is the king of the tooth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Geller did not appear, on the surface he was going to show his own worth, not bothering to see the most interesting first show, in fact he was another There are things in the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregor at the moment is the most common dress, urging his mount to hurry in the wild. His mount is now fully capable of moving in an instant, moving forward to a certain place with great speed. About 300 kilometers away from the city - it took only 30 minutes to run this distance - he stopped. What is in front of him is just a small hill that is very common on this land, specifically, a rocky hill that is not very large. The beast has come more than once, and it knows what to do. With a low voice, the beast disappeared in front of this small hill along with the Geller on its back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who would know that this rocky hill would be hollow if there was no other person’s guidance? Geller thought as he walked. Even though he has been there many times, he is still very curious about the excavation of a cave with no outside entrance in a hill, but he also knows that some things should not be asked. Even now that he has become the king of teeth, he still has awe of the owner of this cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beast walked through this long cave in a relaxed footstep, and finally there was light in front, and the cave was over. At the end of the long passage is a space that does not know where to emit light. It can be called the space of the hall. At this moment, a man wearing armor is sitting on the ground, as if he is fighting, holding a sword in his arms. The human being seemed to hear the footsteps of the beast that was almost impossible to hear. When Greer appeared, he raised his head. For a moment, he was transformed from a most comfortable rest state to a state in which the beast was about to pounce on the prey. The dangerous breath that he sent out scared and even the beastly fierce beast stopped acting. The man saw the front of Geller, and he immediately re-relaxed and rested, and the change was as if he had not been disturbed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gerle walked down the beast and walked toward a translucent stone wall. When he took a few steps, a voice came from behind the stone wall. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Geller, you still violated my meaning! What are you looking for now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Sorry, Lord! But please believe, I am not deliberately going to violate your meaning!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I told you a few times, now When the attack was launched, the attack was only a slap in the face, and it only made humans wary. Now their Magic Corps will not leave Hope again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But the Sayādaw, you also consider my situation. Although I am a king, I have no way to suppress the emotions of the subordinates. Moreover, if there is not a big victory, the War priest will not support me!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Forget it! Since everything has been done, it’s no use saying anything! You are definitely not only apologizing to me this time, what is going on soon? Say it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sir, I want to restore the ancient corps of the corps, no, I Let rough beast Corps, exceed the size of ancient times, so ...... "<br <br /> & nbsp />; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;"Very good, they have the greatest credit for this offense!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it? I am relieved. Right, how about the weapon? Dwarf The craftsmanship is superb? The brave of the Orcs and the craftsmanship of the dwarves, the days of mankind will not be better!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Advanced large weapons have not been equipped to the army It’s inside, but it’s going to be very soon, and our army’s combat power will be greatly improved!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Okay! You can go!” The voice did not seem to continue to discuss with Geller. He did not hesitate to go to the order, but Geller’s business was already finished, and he was about to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before leaving, Geller once again saw the man who was still fighting. Both the Sayādaw and this strange human being give him a feeling of opaqueness. To be honest, he still doesn't know what the true purpose of the Sayādaw is. He doesn't even know what this self-proclaimed Sage is. Geller crossed the back of the beast. This beast was the first time he and his lord met each other and was given to him. At the beginning, he successfully crossed the forest alliance site by the power of this beast and arrived at the high leprechaun. The land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recalling the past, Geller suddenly had a feeling of fear. I am just a person who even wants to go to the land of high spirits to find the legendary God of War. At the time of departure, I didn’t even think of anything on the road waiting for him. He just lost his dreams and realized the dream of reunifying the half-orc, the common dream of every young man. That trip was really hard! Crossing the barren half-orc wilderness, crossing the dangerous human land, passing through the land of the Forest Alliance, which absolutely does not welcome the Orcs, and taking away their precious spoils under the eyes of the higher fairies. If you are not accidentally encountering the Supreme, you will probably die in an unknown place like other half-orcs who have had this ambition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gerler’s heart has an inexplicable fear of the sage, and the sage can always see the future with a sharp eye. His words are always like that. Correct, correct makes him afraid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he finally returned to the Orc’s land with the hammer of the god of war, he said that he was saying goodbye to the sage when he thought that the big announcement was made. I will definitely come back to him. Sure enough, no one admitted his status. The nobles even wanted to kill him and won the hammer of the god of war. He finally had to go to find the sage again, and then organized the armed forces under the guidance of the sage, and took the teeth with force. The throne of the king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greek is essentially unwilling to be under the control of others. This military action is an attempt to control from the Supreme, but it is not yet When completely out of the Lord. This land in the north can only produce war wolves and woolly rhinoceros. All other arms are provided by the Sacred, and the Sayādaw also allows the dwarf to establish contact with him so that his army can be equipped. The dwarf's well-crafted weaponry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meditation of Göller, the beast has begun to move to Cyril at high speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound gradually increases, fully illustrating the fire yao flavor in the dialogue between the two parties Growing up. Time is passing, and if you don't get antidote again, the two teams will not live. The efficacy of the drug is being played, and some people have begun to feel a stomachache, which means that the Orcs did not lie to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be said that everyone is very sensible now, at least there is nothing on the surface to use force. But in the human heart, the fear of death and the disappointment of this undeveloped negotiation are gradually rising. There are always a few people who value themselves in the crowd, and those who are temporarily elected do not have the authority to suppress this kind of psychology. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The balance is suddenly broken, one person - if Kim does not admit mistakes, is one of the guards who are in conflict with them at the gate of the city - In the absence of anyone's defense, grab a key and rush to an iron box. Indeed, as soon as a box is opened, the two teams lose the reason for the dispute. A conflict will not happen. . However, the purpose of this person is not so noble, because his goal is to put his antidote box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orc designed this lock obviously when it was considered, this lock is difficult to open, and can only be opened slowly without any interference. And this condition is now clearly not available. Another team immediately stopped this behavior - with their short swords to stop! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kim turned his face, but Wei still used his face without expression - since he woke up, he has been looking like this, and continue to see, at this moment, no one knows what he is thinking. Kim even suspected that Wei was not hit by the mind, and that it is not very clear now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orcs made a scream in the audience, not because of human battles, but because they were scolding them for spending too much time on falsehood. For the half-orc, this situation is a very fair way to solve - the strong, the weak - there is no need to do boring negotiations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The killing is over, only three people have survived to get the medicine. But this is just the beginning of this fight, and the dinner has not yet come up! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We turned around and he moved to the front of Kim and began to speak to Kim in sign language. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Have you seen it? Just now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sudden, Jin felt The companion in front of him is so strange, maybe he never knew this companion, he can read the human murderous performance in cold blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe in the near future, we have to go up! It means that the two of us must kill each other!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Gold began to look up at the soldiers in front of him, but Wei did not feel anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Will you kill me with all your strength?" the magician asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about you?" Wei did not respond positively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold felt something in his throat that was stuffed, and then he shook his head resolutely. "I will never shoot you, I will not shoot for a partner! Even if you kill me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am the same! "In the eyes of Wei at the moment, there is a kind of familiarity that Kim is familiar with. "I won't fight with you. If I am going to die, I will die under the enemy's sword. I can only get the enemy's blood in my hand." There will never be a companion's blood!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a silence, Wei said to Kim: "Are you ready? Nothing to say?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the final farewell of two people, both of whom have already done The decision to go to death came out. On the upcoming corner, they are about to guard the Orcs, and the Orcs will kill them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 05<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon, the bloody and dead capitals on the field were removed, though There are dozens of lives dead, but for this corner show, this is just an appetizer. The next thing is the dinner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the window of the dungeon, you can see what a half-orc is making loudly, and with the bursts of shouts and shouts from the audience, Kim knows him. It is definitely not a good thing to announce. Now Kim suddenly regrets a bit. He should learn the language of the Orcs when he was at the Stone Tower. Unfortunately, he thought that he would not deal with the Orcs for a lifetime, so he did not learn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of half-orcs walked into the field, and Kim immediately recognized that this was part of the deserters. Just as he was curious, Wei pulled his robes and walked here with footsteps. Now the footsteps of the iron boots are as if they are sent by the god of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two captives were pulled out of the dungeon and they were quickly taken to the arena. The two men stood unarmed in the center of the field, and they used fire to form a wide circle of fire, with only one gap that allowed only one person to pass. Outside the ring of fire, there are nearly a hundred fully armed deserters. This is the important god of war, who can cut the heads of these two humans and put his head on the altar on the side of the gladiatorial field, he can get forgiveness, and the rest, only one dead end. In other words, only two or so half of the orcs can become winners. This is already a gift. There was only one victim in the fire circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orc is very satisfied with the state of the two captives, the magician’s physical condition is better, but he has no way to use magic now, a magic that cannot be magical What can a teacher use? At this moment, Wei has not healed the whole body, but he can already carry out certain activities. In this way, they can carry out a little insignificant resistance or escape, so that the deserters can not kill them very smoothly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kim noticed that the fire ring is made of thick oil. Although the flame is not very high, the temperature is not low. If you accidentally step into the oil ring, it will slip, and then it will be burnt and burned alive. dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the sound of the horn, the brutal battle began, and the Orcs immediately pulled out their weapons, but no one dared to launch the attack first. Everyone knows, The first one is the most disadvantageous. The new grease was slowly poured in. As the oil slowly moved toward the lower center, the gap between the ring of fire and the ring of fire was slowly getting smaller. If the half-orcs did not start early, their targets would They will be burned to death, then they are really finished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the battle will always break out. From the first sound of the blade, the whole scene is broken, and the half-beasts are torn into a ball. This is For the sake of life, every soldier has exerted his full strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two adventurers stood in the middle of the circle of fire. Although they couldn’t understand the words of the Orcs, they could also see an approximation. The only good news is that they can kill a few orcs before they die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle at the entrance to the ring of fire is particularly fierce. Passing here is the first step to victory, but it is because of this that there is no way to pass. Constantly, half-orcs were forced to retreat into the fire by their opponents, and then became a piece of coke in the screams, and the madness mixed with blood made the audience scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in such a situation, Kim also saw that some of the Orcs did not participate in the war. Their goal is very clear. They must grab the middle, not to the sea of ​​fire. Adventure inside. Relatively speaking, this cool, awkward guy is the most dangerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, language is no longer necessary, two people can communicate with each other only with their eyes, and the adventurers will not be ready to go, two The individual is ready for the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was finally a half-orc rushed over, his body is now full of people who don’t know who they belong to, and the eyes of the half-orc He was slashed to Wei, who was closest to him. At this moment, he already thought that the victory was in the grip. He did not think that these humans would resist, and it was not the powerless rebellion in anticipation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warrior in front of him suddenly rushed over with the speed of a man of this kind of injury, slamming his shoulder to the belly of this half-orc . Although the abdomen has armor protection, Wei's shoulder collision did not cause injury, but this impact is enough to make this half-orc stand unstable and fall to the ground. The magician rushed from the side at this time. At the time of this life and death, the gold skill without any fighting training became flexible. Now the damn lock of his magic handcuff is his only weapon. He waved his hands and slammed his hand on the head of the unlucky half-orc. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold and the half-orc felt a sharp pain at the same time, Kim felt that his wrist was probably broken, and the half-orc was dark after the pain, nothing Got it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei’s shoulders were swollen all over, and he paid a price for this action. However, this is not the time to check the pain, because another half of the orcs are rushing over. Wei uses the quickest action he can do to pick up the sword of the half-orc. As long as there is a weapon in hand, the person who wants to kill him must pay a high price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Wei at the moment is very aware of the current situation, no one knows his physical condition better than himself. He has no way to send out his debilitating temperament. Every activity will protest without hesitation. He must save. It is not the saving of physical strength in the usual sense, but to save every movement and remove all unnecessary movements. Only then can he win—or say, kill the most half-orcs before they die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei’s sword rushed to the half-orc who rushed into the ring of fire, and only made a real effort when he stabbed half. When the Orc was planning to parry, the speed of the sword increased several times. He did not have time to react to the speed of this sudden change. The tip of the sword pierced his throat before his weapon blocked. If it is not a clever swordsman, there is no way to see the high spirit of this sword. On one side, the gold only sees Wei forward, and without any other action, kills a half-orc, as if the half-orc himself had his throat. Sent to his sword tip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the reduction of half-orcs outside the ring of fire, more and more orcs can rush over. This is the first time Wei has brought the sword to this level. There is no superfluous movement. The sword does not make any contact with the enemy's blade. Every time, he avoids the half-orc with a slight difference. Full of attacks, then let the sword edge into the other's neck. Before this battle, he always had enough physical strength to waste him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
