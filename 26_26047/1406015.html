			<div id="content">The offensive suddenly stopped, and the offensive side retreated. The defensive side did not dare to chase, because it was not because they won, but because the other's advantage has been established, they have actually escaped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behan is barely maintained, but fortunately the magician’s paralysis goal is Lev and Wei, otherwise he can’t stand it now! Before jumping off, the magician gave him a magic to enhance the armor's protective ability, but even then, he still had a few more wounds on his body, and the shoulders on the right side of the armor were cut off, compared to The damage, more serious is the consumption of physical strength. When the battle temporarily subsides, the accumulated fatigue will be madly thrown up, making him feel that the power of the sword holding the earth is gone! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many enemies have just been defeated? Behan thought so hard while breathing, but in fact he did not be able to defeat several enemies. In addition to using the sword of the earth for the first wave of surprises, it was better to say that he was defending. There is no such thing as a mediocre enemy. The continuous cooperation and attack are seamless, and the absolute advantage of the number makes him have no chance to use the sword of the earth for the second time! However, relying on him to attract the attention of the enemy, Elna successfully settled seven or eight, although the boxing fighter can not kill, but the person who married the Erna iron fist did not move for two days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other side is not optimistic, because the center of the hall is filled with purple powder, so people can only rush from both sides of the wall, although Lev and Wei defended together, but due to the influence of paralysis, in fact, only Wei is fighting now, and this barbarian warrior always has room to refuse to succumb to the killer. Otherwise, he will concentrate on attacking. Skills and explosive balls attached to the armor, there are now at least ten bodies on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Stop, you can't escape!" The magician spoke after a brief calm. The skills and abilities of the other side have been very clear, although the enemy still has the strength - from the fact that they have not killed a person so far - but the outcome is obvious... there are already twelve in the opposite side of the hall. The longbow was aimed at five people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold slowly regroups power, just after the magic was interrupted The impact of the temporary loss of control of magical energy has not disappeared. Although he knows that at least five bows are aimed at him, as long as he first sets up a defensive magical "wind ring" against bows and arrows, the threat will be eliminated immediately. Kim’s concentration again began to meditate on the prayers, but on the surface he tried to make himself look less like he was preparing for magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop!" The magician repeated it. He was very confident in the magic of the companion and the door. This is the strength of the enchantment. Closing the spell, as long as the outer enchantment is not destroyed, the door is unbreakable, and except for the small passage outside the door, the rest of the hotel has been surrounded by enchantment, and these wanted criminals simply cannot escape. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are you?" Behan asked, although I couldn’t think of anything that was really feasible, but there was nothing wrong with delaying the time! "You are not an ordinary adventurer! Is it a professional bounty hunter group?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bounty Hunter Group?...haha...we are actually seen as The Bounty Hunter Group! It’s really interesting. The magician laughed. From the beginning, only he was talking, so the adventurer can easily judge that he is the leader of this group! "Oh... your bounty is very attractive, but we are not a bounty hunter group..." He seems to have broken the thought that Behan wants to temporarily delay the time. "But if you don't immediately put down your arms, I don't mind. Then your heads will go to the reward!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Speaking, he made a gesture, and the archers immediately made the bowstring bigger, so that the enemy would be more The feeling of more threats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn!" Behan’s mind carefully considered the response to this scene. He has noticed that only one of the three magicians is in the battle. Paralysis was used to assist the attack, and the other two have been using magic against their feet. Behan knows this magic. He used to see the magician used to seal the power of the sword in his hands during the mercenary career. The two magicians have already completed the move, which completely cuts off the adventurers. The opportunity to attack the archers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The guy in the git!" The cursing man cursed in this way, and did not consider the wizard's proposal. He has been a mercenary, knowing what the consequences of surrendering weapons are, even if it is formal, the treatment of the army that strictly abides by those conventions is definitely not a comfortable thing, not to mention that his companion has a woman he admires. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the soldiers and Elna wearing the armor of the whole body, the other three people may not escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After looking through the center of the hall filled with purple powder, the row of archers are aiming at their side, they can be seen from their stable posture. The level of archery will not be bad. Although these powders are not fatal, they can also inhale people's mobility and get paralyzed for hours. They make the enemy unable to form a siege, but they also become the barriers that archers protect themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that only this trick is used! It was the new use of the sword of the earth that was discovered in the contest conference—that is, the one that he was stabbed by a sword and was very disgraceful. He was called “light flash”. The skill, this trick can not directly transmit power through the earth, but the power of the sword of the earth is very expensive. Once the light flashes, the sword of the earth can't recover the power in a few days, and he I am not sure to use the light to flash and knock down so many people at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you must try it! Behan clenched the magic sword in his hand, and the sword of the earth responded to his will and began to gather all the power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold began to feel wrong, the wind's elf gathered very slowly, slow is a bit too much, which made him delay to gather power to use magic There is only one explanation for this situation, and some people use unusually strong wind magic in the vicinity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I give you the last chance! I am going to ten, if I don’t let go of the weapon, then let’s die!” The magician has also been from the other side. In the eyes, they saw that they did not give up much, and issued the final warning. "One...two..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He ordered three numbers, When I tried to take a breath and continued to count, I found that this breath could not be sucked back! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold finally grasped the activities of the Wind Elves, I don’t know why, all the elves of the wind are leaving this space at high speed, the air is being sucked away from this enchantment No matter how he repeatedly recited the prayers, he could not fight this strange power. He quickly gave up his efforts to use the ring of the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician instinctively continued to take a bite, but this move only allowed the air in the lungs to continue to come out. He suddenly realized that someone was using magic to extract this. The air inside the enchantment! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Put the arrow!" He tried his best to squeeze out the last trace of air from the lungs to issue this order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the archers loosened the bowstrings, their targets responded almost simultaneously, and Wei’s hands suddenly appeared with a blasting ball flying towards them. Han also made his trick! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Light flash!" The sword of the earth draws an arc in the air, and huge energy is released from this magic sword to form a The light belt flew toward the flying arrows that were coming in from the front. Like Behan’s expectations, whether it’s the hardwood’s arrow or the steel<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the iron arrow can’t resist this powerful energy, after the two crossed, these arrows Just like a twist, it becomes a piece of debris, which does not pose any threat. The arrows that are not in direct contact with this energy are also affected by the shock wave, completely lost the prospect, and do not know where to shoot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white energy band is like a huge scimitar, and the blood mixed with the minced meat is sprayed out. Those who hold the longbow do not have How many can dodge the opportunity, can only let this white scythe ruthlessly cut their chest and waist, Behan is the first time to find this trick actually has such a great power, he remembers this last move only broke The opponent's armor, but this time, he split the seven people from the middle into two, and he only hoped that this guy could knock down those guys instead of the waist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei’s magic followed, and the blasting ball fell ruthlessly among those who had split into two segments and had not yet split into two segments, with glowing energy To veto the existence of life, in just one or two seconds, the archers were swept away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enemies on both sides rushed up, but the loss of air has affected everyone, compared to the rest of the hall, the situation of the adventurers standing by the door the best. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's the matter!" Lev quickly looked at Kim, but the magician gave him a gesture to prove that he had nothing to do with this strange thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get out of the way!" The warrior in armor gave up the enemy in front of him and rushed to the door after throwing a blast of magic, trying to use his weight to hit the sturdy door. There is no way to breathe in this room. If this continues, it will take only five minutes to stay alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wearing the fierce impact of the body on the door, Wei this collision is all-out, he wears the weight of the armor plus the inertia of running, if this If the door is only locked, even if the door is not broken, the threshold can't hold it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We found out that the door was in the wrong moment at the moment of contact with the door. The door was simply hidden, and it was echoed with his shoulder. Open, the body with too strong force completely lost the center of gravity, can not hold the momentum of the forefront, and fell to the ground outside the door! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone stunned. Almost everyone, except the Wei who hit the door, clearly saw that the door was in contact with the soldier’s body. The moment before the sudden suddenly opened, whether it was the gold that had just hit the door, or the other people who watched him hit the door, they could not believe their eyes! In particular, there is no one at the door, and it is obvious that no one is just opening the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leif is the first person to come back. The effectiveness of magic is limited. Now it has faded. Wei’s explosive ball has blocked the enemy’s progress. The road is a good opportunity to retreat! He grabbed a stool and threw it at the opposite enemy, covering them both back. Kim was still looking at the door, and seemed to want to figure out what happened just now, but the thief who ran over pulled him hard and took him out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adventurer’s movements are very fast, surpassing their enemies, and everyone ran to the space where the door was facing, just as they had expected, this place is The only exit to the enchantment. Wei, who just got up, stayed behind, but in reality there is no possibility of fighting. The thinness of the air is just beyond the limit that humans can accept. There is no way to breathe! In this environment, no matter whether it is a mage or an archer, no one has the opportunity to attack the enemy. Everyone simply rushes outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pedestrians on the road are still walking normally. Suddenly, a few fully armed people suddenly appear to be coming out of the hotel as if they were coming out of the air. The commotion came into being, but then there was more confusion, because the people who were standing near the hotel pulled out their weapons and rushed to these people! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Spy...killing...Helping...I’m going to come..." A burst of fear that the world’s voices are coming out of the crowd, immediately Let the confusion expand tenfold! People on the street are desperately pushing, and people who are already nervous by the news of the war are rushing around, making those who try to intercept these five adventurers cause a lot of trouble because of their initial mission. It’s monitoring, not fighting, they are too scattered! The number of people who can rush up is too small, and it is easily broken! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five people rushed to the street, at the corner, a familiar voice passed over! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey! Young people! Come over... come here!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s Old Locke He is waving to five people in a small alley! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five people follow this strange old man in a turn of the corner. Old Locke seems to be familiar with the terrain of this area. The adventurer can only follow his back. There are footsteps and screams at the beginning, but very quickly, as Old Locke is a labyrinth, these are the same. The sounds are all gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The group of people finally stopped in a remote alley, just ran that kind of urgency, the old Locke looked a bit too much to eat, began to gasp . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You young people, they don't understand the hardships of the old people, they just run so fast..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey...you just ran ahead of you!" Lev originally wanted to say this, but did not say it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, okay, anyway, you have always been so disrespectful of the old man... forget it! But young people, we really have a relationship, actually Here I happened to meet again!" The old man changed his tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold looked at the old Locke, the old man’s dress was much better than the last time he broke up. It seems that the original magician’s gown has been dead, now the old Locke’s Dressing up, even if it can't be said to be very good, but at least it is not much worse. He wore a robes (not a robe) that was roughly fit, and it looked like he had just washed it. He didn’t wear a hat on his head, he had an ordinary cane on his hand, and he wore a very ordinary cloth on his feet. shoe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adventurer and the old man met for the first time was purely an accident. The magician accidentally asked the old man who looked so stubborn (at the time) to eat a meal and was knocked a little money. For this reason he was also said by Lev. A pass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this is the old man who is regarded as a liar, pointing to the adventurer who can cross the orcs and ask for help. This is the old man, in Huo Pucheng’s critical moment taught the gold curse to save the crisis. It was this old man who led them into the bitter cold and rescued the crisis’s companions in the half-orc’s base camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the most important thing is that this old man - which is not known to be intentional or unintentional - has made gold a cursed mage and has a control curse Ability. The magician knew the true meaning of the cursed mage from Nobis, and the control curse was not a universal ability in the Holy Light dynasty as the magician had thought, but an almost unique gift. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes! It’s a coincidence! Meet again!" Lev swallowed the problem that he intended to say, although the old man was simply a question mark. The battle between life and death, in the end, actually escaped in such an incredible way, and now I want to come to the top ten is the hands and feet of this old man. At the beginning, the door that can't be opened can be opened at the touch of a button. There must be something wrong with it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Locke," After the breathing calmed down, Kim finally got the courage to ask this question that had existed in his mind for a long time, "The curse... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Young people!" Old Locke interrupted the magician. "After something, I slowly said, now is not talking, everyone is regaining spirit." Let's go quickly, if the guy who chased you is coming over, you can be in trouble!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are those guys?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You didn't see it? The guy who was so arrogant and unpredictable, he was one of the most famous magicians of Durant, known for his research on the magic array," Old Locke I was a little angry and said, "I have seen him several times. Although I have a bit of a skill, I don’t understand a little politeness. His subordinates don’t even know what it means to respect the elderly, and they have blocked the road and put a knife and a gun. Look! Poor is my cane! It’s a bandit!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cane? Bandit? "Even clear-eyed gold also hear a little faint head turned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Locke handed the head of the hand to the front of the gold so that he could see the distortion of the head of the cane decoration due to the impact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I gave them a little instruction about respecting the elderly, and as a result my cane became like this, and they refused to pay compensation..." The old man said It was justified, but everyone heard that he actually hit the cane with his cane. But no one said it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go! Tell me the stories you have along the way... It’s been a long time since I last met... right, I remember that you are going to Undead Island. Have you been there yet?" Old Locke went all the way and asked without a word, leaving the alley with an adventurer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's true, Your Majesty! I found the pulse of the Holy Grail!" The sacristy is indeed in the hands of human beings, in their palaces!" The dwarf wearing a red robes squatted in front of the dwarf king, calmly reporting the fact that when he looked up, he couldn’t help but glance at it. The tall black figure standing next to the bloody dwarf king. This figure reveals evil, he said to himself in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that you are telling the truth!" Dwarf King, Luman V turned to look at the demon who claimed to be the Supreme, although he brought The news is true, but Luman V's tone is still full of doubts and distrust. He never believes in any demon, no matter what they say in their mouths. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My Majesty, I will never deceive you!" Sayādaw bent over and bowed. "Deceive you is not good for me!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn human!" Luman V issued a full of malicious snoring, and his anger was almost irrepressible! Humans actually took away their unique artifacts, and in his hands of high self-esteem, in his guarded palace! It was on his face, no, on the face of all the dwarves, a loud slap in the face. It is definitely not a dwarf's practice to respond to such a move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a minute, kneel!" The Sayādaw took two steps and stood in front of the dwarf. "What are you doing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course it is to win the game from humans Our stuff! Go away!" The dwarf shook the axe in his hand to the demon. From his expression, everyone could be very clear that he didn't mind letting the weapon stain some blood before the war began. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, please don't be so impulsive... I have a good proposal..." The Sayādaw made a humble gesture to avoid the dwarf being angry Under the shot, he knew that the dwarf in front of him could not refuse his proposal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The six people left the city from the city gate. The entire team of soldiers who had guarded the gates were temporarily taken away because of the huge turmoil in the city, so the adventurers did not encounter any trouble when they left the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This way... The dragon was left by the dragons of the Dragon Island... Babe returned to his father's side of Undead Island... ...no wonder I didn't see the little girl... It's pitiful, for the daughter to become a zombie mage!" Old Locke sighed while listening to the adventurers' words, but there was not much sigh in the voice, "then How did you become the first name on the wanted list?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold talks about the adventures after the 30% off, while paying attention to the old man’s The expression changes, I don't know why, he always has a strange feeling, feeling that his actions are always in the master's grasp, although this is almost impossible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your luck is really not a bad thing..." After listening to the whole cause of the key night burglary that was transformed from a hero to a criminal After the process, especially when the saints took away the magic book, the old man’s original face changed slightly, but even the nearest gold, there is no way to read his from his expression. Mind, "Nothing has been found... except for a wanted crime."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, Mr. Locke..." Lev suddenly asked, " Why are you here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just accidentally thought of going to the city without a night! Just passing by here, just happened to meet you!" Old Locke replied casually, but In the tone of voice, the pronunciation of the words "just" is strengthened. "It’s really a coincidence to say it... Young people, we must have a fate, otherwise how can I meet you when I think about where to eat in the corner?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The old man showed a brilliant smile, watching the thieves who held almost all the assets of the team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have something to go to the city that never sleeps?" Lev quickly tweeted the topic, although he already knew that the old man was definitely not the kind of liar who ate food. But he is even more convinced that if he goes to dinner, he will definitely pay for it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But we have already left the city!" Behan inserted one side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassured, rest assured, I know there is a good place, not far from us, there are good things to eat!" Old Locke said excitedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The good place that Old Locke said is coming soon, this is a family At the intersection of the small villages in the suburbs, it looks like ordinary shops. Whether it is decoration or facilities, the only thing that is not ordinary is the skill of the chef. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cooking of this small hotel owner is indeed praised by the old Locke along the way, it can be said that it has reached an impeccable level, five people because Not hungry, so did not eat much, but the old Locke had a big meal, while he was eating and listening to the magician to carefully explain what happened on the island of Undead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...and then Nubis sent me to the city of Delante with the transfer magic array!" Kim said, his eyes carefully captured. In the face of the old Locke opposite him, he just tried several times and wondered if the "the man" that Nubis said was the mysterious old man in front of him. Honestly, if there is a person who knows Kim to convince the Necromancer to give him guidance, the only possibility is that this elder is simply an honest old man. But the magician was disappointed, and there was no evidence in the eyes of Old Locke. Old Locke’s performance is the same as listening to an adventure story that has nothing to do with him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Father...who is the person who asked Nobis to give me some pointers on magic?" The magician braved the courage and glared at the old man. Locke suddenly spoke when he finished a small glass of light beer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you entrusting Nobis?" The magician almost asked this directly, although he knew it was rude, and if it was really done by Old Locke, then he must have his own concealment of the truth. The reason, however, is that he really wants to know the answer. If it is really old Locke, what is it for? He was originally an ordinary magician who could no longer be ordinary. Why did Old Locke choose him? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah..." Lev made a scream, so that everyone's eyes were focused on him, and everyone saw him crunching. Now! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At Lev’s waist, the pretty worn leather armor was cut into a rather large hole, and the clothes inside were also cut. And everyone remembers that Lev always put his wallet in this position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lev looked at everyone, revealing a rigid smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that you are in trouble?" The old man also saw Lev A large scratch on the leather armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is really trouble, because the adventurers are going all the way to the south in order to get out of Delante’s pursuit. The money is almost on Leif’s body. Because most of the journeys on the way, they dare not approach the densely populated areas, they give the money to a person to buy the necessary supplies, and the thieves are the best choice for this job. There is almost no left around them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five people looked at each other and their expressions were awkward. It’s not a mistake to lose the wallet. In the battle of disparity, no one can take care of their wallet. Moreover, the adventurers also have some valuable things, and they don’t have to lose the money, but now The key trouble is the price of the meal - although I don't know the specific price, I can still judge a rough one. The old Locke chose some expensive dishes - the adventurers can't afford the money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Forget it, Father, we are really in trouble!" Five people did not speak until the magician broke the silence for the first time. "We don't seem to have Enough money..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long fat boss with The laugh appeared next to six guests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A total of six and a half gold coins, count six!" Five adventurers remained silent, and Elna's face turned red all over. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry..." Lev struggled to speak, although these people had the most experience of his experience, but he could not pay for the meal, especially unintentionally. It’s not the case that I’m going to eat the King’s meal at the beginning, and he hasn’t experienced it several times. "We..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give you..." Old Locke took the money out of his body and placed it on the boss's fat hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold wants to talk, but Old Locke made a gesture to signal that they should not move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"First, let's say you owe me!" The old man's face showed a hint of ridicule, reminiscent of the bird catcher seeing the birds flying The expression when entering the net. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Six people left the hotel, Lev walked to the side of old Locke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, Mr. Locke, we will return it to you soon...and return it to you in the next town..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, I have an idea! I am going to the city that never sleeps. It’s just a little things that need adventurers to help, just meet you, just like this, even if the money is my employment. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing in the city that never sleeps?" Everyone looked at the old Locke, and the front of the magician asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh...it's a little dangerous thing, you need some brave adventurers...you don't want to quit, I think you are a very suitable candidate! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only six gold coins..." Lev whispered, the city that never sleeps is the capital of the Reiter empire, and if there is something dangerous to do there, absolutely Not a good thing! But the key is... This mission actually has only six gold coins commission? He hired five adventurers at a time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six people set up a campfire and set up a tent to prepare for camping. Although there is a village nearby, in order to avoid the eyes and ears of others, lest the scene be repeated this afternoon, everyone decided to camp, and, in order to prevent the shift, they arranged shifts. The vigil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Locke is sitting next to the fire. He is the first class tonight. Others have already entered the tent. The moon is still in the treetops. When the moon rises to the top of the tree, he can hand over to Wei. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man leans on the golden magic wand, he seems to be thinking about something, just moving his face to the round head decoration part of the top of the stick The flame on the fire was jumping cheerfully, and the old wrinkled face was reflected in golden yellow, constructing an expression of serious, serious, slightly sad thinking of an elderly person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The footsteps came from behind, and the old man turned his head and saw Wei, who was coming out of the tent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come on, it’s not yet time!" The old man said this, then turned his head back and continued to look at the flames beating in front of him. "Young is so good,哎..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We walked to the side of old Locke and sat down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A very beautiful Aton's armor, young man!" Old Locke looked at the soldier and smiled. "This armor and this sword are very commensurate with you." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Aton's A?" Wei stayed for a moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes...we call those substances that do not belong to this world "Aton"... This is a very rare thing, even rarer than the holy silver ... Where did you get it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What I got from Long Island is something that Long Elder gave me..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't say this, you have something to ask me!" The old man turned his face back to the fire, using a magic wand as a fire stick to pull on the firewood, let The flame is higher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to ask about this sword!" Wei handed the sword to the old Locke and looked at the old man with a look of hope. Since he knew that the old man had some knowledge of the sword, he had been regretting why he did not ask the old Locke, but this time there was a chance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to know?" Old Locke took the sword in his hand and easily held the rather heavy sword in his hand, then The flame reflected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's how to use it!" Wei suppressed the excitement that came from his heart. He looked at the old Locke's expression. The old man really knows something about this. The thing of the sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How to use..." Old Locke smiled softly, then crossed the sword to his face and watched the sword carefully through the fire. On every texture, "...not useful, even if I tell you, you can't use this sword!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?!" Differences and a beating in front of Wei, let the fear and worry of these two uncommon emotions appear in the hearts of the soldiers. He knew from the mouth of Kim that the old man was very creative in magic. He immediately thought of the most likely question. "Do you need magic to use it? No... It doesn't matter, although I don't use magic now, but I can learn... ...I am still young, whether it takes ten or twenty years, I can certainly learn..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No... use this sword You don't need this... You know, this sword is not made by humans, but a craft of high fairness..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...only Is it used by higher fairies?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No...not like this...do you know? The craft of this sword is now impossible for humans, even The most brilliant times of ancient humans can't be done. Don't say humans, even in the high spirits, no one has ever reproduced this skill. The legendary craftsman Robert Nikki, who originally cast them, whose name was permanently passed, also Casting these three swords to pay for life, there is no secret to casting a sword Down..." Old Locke said, while gently rubbing the ridge of the sword with his fingernails, carefully listening to the sound of this metal. "This sword was created by absorbing the life of the founder, and it is a high leprechaun." Eternal life!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, they were personally named by their founders, called "Wilderness", "Golden Morning", and this "fangs"! Old Locke put the sword back to Wei's side, slowly said "But, the other two swords are gone, only the "fangs" are left... The other two swords have been turned into dust with their users, leaving only some forgotten books to record. The story of these three swords, and I am one of the few people who have the chance to see these books - this is the only remaining sword that has been stored as a treasure of the higher goblins... until the humans defeat the high spirits, this sword It has also become a trophy for human beings."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Locke handed the sword back to Wei’s hand. "In fact, the use of this sword does not make sense to you. You can use it only as a weapon. This tooth is a very good weapon, it is both handy and sharp, and it will hardly be damaged. It is fully qualified to be a sharp blade... Yes, Why do you want to know how to use this sword?"<br /><br />&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want revenge!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Revenge?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is a demon destroying my hometown and killing all my loved ones, so I need to know how to use this sword. Since it was created to destroy the demon, there must be a force that can defeat the demon. - Tell I, how is the power of it used?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah..." Old Locke looked at Wei’s face, hate and pain together to engrave this handsome face a threatening expression, "But this sword is just called the Demon Sword. It is not really made to fight the demon. - Because the demon is powerful, ordinary steel and magic can give The demon caused damage and did not need special weapons. Moreover, "Old Locke paused. "By your strength, although it is a bit difficult to defeat a demon, it is not impossible. It is not necessary to cling to this sword. As long as your companions join hands, you can definitely play Demons ...... "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; What? ! This sword is just a name called the Demon Sword? Isn't it a weapon made to fight the demon? Even if a thunderbolt falls on his feet, Wei can't be shocked. He couldn't hear the following words. He could see that Old Locke's lips were moving up and down, but there were countless voices in his head, so that the ears could not receive information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is this? Is this sword just a name called a demon sword? No, this is impossible. Since I have been in the second fight with the Eight-Eyed Devil, since I have known the insurmountable gap between him and the Eight-Eyed Devil, even if he has always been strong, he cannot accept this blow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since then, this demon sword is his hope, he remembers that he used this weapon to penetrate the body of the devil to cause damage, originally thought to use only Can find the true power of this sword, he can defeat the devil, which almost became his only hope of revenge, but...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sword is only It is called a magic sword! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the last time you used this sword to hurt the devil is just because it happened? Just because he was trying to deal with the elders of the dragon and was accidentally caught by the gap? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's the matter with you? Wei..." Old Locke noticed the change of the warrior, and Wei's face turned pale in the blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No...nothing...useless, I and the gold plus the dragon elders, combined with the strength of our three, can not defeat the demon... Maybe they are telling the truth, it is not an ordinary demon..." Wei said a little sluggishly. Suddenly there was a burst of self-destruction in his heart, and he wanted to fold the sword into pieces and throw it away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you both add a dragon?" Now it’s the turn of the old Locke. "Is there a demon who can fight the dragon? No, it's impossible, How is this possible? Is it..." He whispered to himself, thinking of a worst thought in his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moon has risen above the top of the tree, and the bright moon shines on this camp, according to this fire, according to the two people who have fallen into a short silence . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait a minute, after slackening the hand holding the sword, Wei suddenly thought of a problem, if the real power of the sword is not used to destroy the demon, what is that? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Locke..." The soldier broke the silence, looked up and looked at the old man in front of him. He suddenly found the fire mixed with the old man in front of the moonlight. Let this aging figure produce a majestic, sacred, irresistible feeling, so that he can't speak at once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...What is the real purpose of the Demon Sword? What are they made for?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Real use?" Unspeakable laughter, "They are made by the high-level goblins in order to destroy the artifacts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Artifacts?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, the true power of this sword is that it can destroy artifacts and destroy items made by the power of the gods." After finishing this sentence, Old Locke clearly saw Wei’s face. It can be counted as a desperate disappointment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The demon who can fight against the dragon..." Old Locke carefully tasted the words that Wei just said, "Yes, Wei, can you talk about it in the dragon?" What happened on the island?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah..." Old Locke’s loud words pulled Wei back from the awkward state. In fact, he has made a decision in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We started to talk about what happened in Long Island. He didn’t talk much, it was very simple, but it was more detailed than gold. In the narrative of the day, Kim mainly talks about what happened on Undead Island, and other parts skipped a lot of details, including what happened on the Dragon Island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Locke listened carefully to Wei’s words and only asked when necessary. Wei did not notice that the old man's face became more and more dignified. When he heard the honorable man make a generous promise to the elders of the dragon and asked them to join, his face almost turned into a blue, but then he heard the dragon elder refused. When this request was made and there was a conflict with the Sayādaw, his face was alleviated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei’s remarks were finally finished, and Old Locke exhaled a long breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Old..." "You..." The two men almost opened at the same time, but immediately stopped and waited for the other person to speak, causing a brief silence. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Father," or Wei Xian opened his mouth. "Do you know anything about the demon?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Yes, if I am not mistaken, he should be." Old Locke sighed. "If my guess is not wrong, young people, your revenge is probably impossible, no matter how you are. Do, only vain and sacrifice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you know this demon?" Wei's eyes suddenly burst into a ray of light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes...if I think there is nothing wrong with it. Do you know? In ancient times, there was no race in the world, this race is not "God's creation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are countless races in this world, all of which are said to have been created by the gods when the world began to form, every god At least they have created an ideal creature in their own minds, but the chaotic three gods in the gods are not made..." Old Rockton paused, "But actually, they also created a person who knows the existence. Race... Their abilities are excellent, they are powerful people with both wisdom and strength. The only weakness is that they have only three! This race is neither dead nor born. In some ways, they are simply living. Artifact! And the demon we are talking about is created by this race."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The real name of this race is tabooed by all the knowers, buried in the oldest In history, In us, we can only call them devils."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is they who make the demon, although no one knows their motives, maybe for boring, maybe It is what the goal is met, but in short, this purely devastating race is created, and the number is so much. Soon, this continent has footprints of this terrible race everywhere."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All races, whether they are feuds or allies, unite together to fight the threat of the demon, forming a big league. At this time, everyone knows the existence of the three devils, knows Their identity and strength, then, in order to completely eliminate the threat of the demon, the Alliance decided to destroy the three devils!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the devil is not dead, this is from one The power that was decided at the beginning, I said, from a certain point of view, they are artifacts of life, they can not be destroyed, this is the price they are unable to bear and multiply. In order to break the setting of the gods, The greatest craftsman in the goblin, named Robert Nick, used his own life to create three swords that could destroy the devil—that is, destroy the artifact—and use the mysterious method that could not be verified. A group of high-class goblins - all of whom are the most famous, brave, and noblest warriors - organized an expedition with them and defeated the devil, but all the warriors all died gloriously. Although there is another saying It is said that this expedition is composed of warriors with multiple races. In the end, there are still several survivors, but it is irrelevant to pursue these historical issues. What I want to tell you is..." Old Locke faced with a heavy tone. The soldier who was staring at his face said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
