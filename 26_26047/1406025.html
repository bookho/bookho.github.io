			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five are concentrated in the center of this underground derelict temple. I don't know when I have portrayed a space magic array, and it has already started to work, and the entire magic array is shining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How did Elna not come yet?" Lev looked at the distance, but the light here was not so good, not far from how far. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's go, she probably won't come!" Old Locke looked at the distance and said to several other people who had been armed well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's wait a minute, Elna should come!" Kim did not believe the answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A white robes of a therapist appeared in the dark, making everyone happy, but when they approached, they discovered that the therapist was not Elna. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The priest gave me a message." The therapist went to the surprised people. "Let you wait for too long - Miss Elna has decided not to go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man in the white robe took a ceremony and then turned and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's go!" Old Locke said, and everyone followed him to the magical array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Get started!" Old Locke said, the remnant of the golden-eyed corner suddenly caught a sudden figure, a purple robe figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is - Nubis?!" Before finally being transferred to the space, Kim finally recognized the familiar shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scenes in front of the scene change rapidly, when everyone decides to come, They found themselves in a tunnel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here?" Jin looked around and it looked like an abandoned mine, next to an upward ladder. But there is a magical array on the ground - just like the magical array that was sent by Nubis to the city of Durant last time, it is obviously an ancient site. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come with me!" Old Locke did not answer the gold. He first climbed the ladder that looked old but still strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an empty space outside, and you can see some of the walls that have collapsed because of the earthquake. Outside the city that was hit by the accident, it was a huge crack, just like the earth suddenly opened its mouth. There are several houses in the vicinity, but no one has ever lived, because I don’t know if the earthquake will come again for a second time, so the residents are temporarily evacuated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is..." Lev pointed to the crack in the distance and asked Old Locke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, the crack leads to the forgotten underground city." Old Locke replied, "Let's see it in the past."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This area is located in the plains, but the land is not rich. Due to the development of the city that never sleeps, there are not many farmers who have cultivated outside the city. Most of the original fields are absurd. The adventurers did not encounter much obstacles and went to the crack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really deep!" Lev carefully looked into the crack, deep inside, not visible to the end, and full of a strange The breath, as if something will come out from this darkness at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do we want to go down here?" Behan asked Old Locke. He estimated the length of the crack in the earth, which is about tens of kilometers long. If they want to go straight, only let Kim take them one by one with flying magic. But no one knows what is in this darkness, this method is too risky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No! Going along the crack, we will find a place to go! We must hurry! Although there are many defensive intruders in the underground city of Dakenis The measures, but they have been two days longer than us, we must speed up the pace!" Old Locke said loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, the ancient underground city." Old Locke replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician stopped talking, and the group followed the old Locke and began to move forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Locke said that there was nothing wrong with it, it was only about half an hour, and they saw a slope that could make people go down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the ground down, the crack is dark in the depths, but once you slowly walk down, you find that there is actually no such thing as you can imagine. The light is still good, and you can barely see the surrounding environment. In fact, it is not so much like a city in the old Locke's mouth. It is a complicated tunnel: it is well-connected, and most of it is manually renovated. It is obviously a long time ago. The thing is - the natural cave. The perforated light vines reveal their roots everywhere, giving the incoming person a faint light. Old Locke said that this is the passage that was dug when the city of Dakenis was built. It was no longer used after the completion of the City of Magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where is the guardian Warcraft inhabited here?" Now Leif is ahead. The road here is obviously not even familiar with the old Locke, so it was changed to Leif, and the thieves are choosing their own direction according to the weak flow of air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, at most there are only mice..." Old Locke smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clear voice passed from the other side, and the sound could not have been sent by the mouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, Mr. Locke, the mouse we met this time is really too big!" Lev showed an ironic smile, then pulled out Own short sword and quickly hide to a corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is ready to go, everyone is ready for the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An object appears in the front of the turn, and Wei’s body slams up, intending to use an unexpected slam to give something that doesn’t know what it is. A little, but his footsteps stopped after two steps, because it was a person who appeared from the turn. A human in black armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah..." The man gave a scream, and he immediately saw Wei’s murderous look, just as Wei took his footsteps, he The sword has also been pulled out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two looked at each other and suddenly they found each other’s faces familiar. Wei Yih couldn't remember who the other person was, but that person clearly recognized them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it you?" The man groaned and slowly took the sword back. Then, several people appeared behind him, all armed, and there was a man wearing a robe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are also looking for a dragon contract?" The other party spoke, but the content scared everyone to jump. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The last time I lost, but this time I will not lose to you!" The man looked at Wei. Although he has already retracted the sword, he still reveals some kind of hostility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah...that's the one!" Behan finally remembered the other side, thanks to the sword he had smashed in the ring. It is the famous warrior known as "black feather", the holder of the magic sword "dark wind", and also the person who defeated him completely in the ring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no plan for both sides to fight, Kim they remain vigilant and look at the opposite pedestrian, they have about seven, and soon enter a passage that disappears in everyone's Inside the field of vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened?" Lev jumped from his hiding position and looked at Old Locke. “It seems that everyone knows what is hidden in this place...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I deliberately let the adventurer’s union release the news...” Old Locke replied, he The expression on the face is difficult to distinguish, but as far as Lev’s position is concerned, the old man has recovered the cheeky state of the past. "Now some people around the world who are ambitious know the existence of this thing! There are definitely many people coming here to find it! This way our chances are greatly increased!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;They continue to move forward, and Lev is marking every possible confusing turn to prevent the possibility of getting lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is Old Locke? And what is his purpose for? Kim suddenly began to rethink this issue. Da Siye said that he is the leader of the Adventurers' Union, so his amazing intelligence ability is not surprising, and there are so many resources in his hands. But... why is he? Why did he find himself? Why do you always want to use them to complete your mission? In the whole team, except Wei, there is really no other person in the whole team! Although he is now a cursed mage, when he first met in the Snow City, he was a rare magician other than young, and even the intelligence of the adventurer’s union. He knows too much.... Yes, he also said that he was watching the establishment of the temple - which means he lived at least three or four hundred years! Wait a minute, the Supreme has promised to restore the youth to the law, then the old Locke is also...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All kinds of questions revolve around the heart of Kim, the answer seems to be This piece of blur slowly formed, but it could not be captured clearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, I think we are near!" Lev screamed. The flow in the air begins to come alive, meaning that a huge space is nearby. This should be the city of Dakos, which Old Locke said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Father!" Lev rubbed the rock with a knife to create an identifiable mark, and asked. "Right, you said that this city is called the city of Dakos, how do you know!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a written record," Old Locke faintly answered . "When the curse was abused into war, the magicians left these places that could become targets of the curse at any time, and evacuated... This is why the Reiter empire can find the crystallization of ancient magic and make the city that never sleeps. The reason."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you say those glowing pillars of light come from the city of Dakos?" Kim asked in surprise, and suddenly he remembered a question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, I remember that there is a record in the book. When the undead war was, the prince of the Reiter empire summoned the dragon with the contract of the dragon... now this How could the contract be buried in this ancient city?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It’s another contract, the contract can only be used once...ah...”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all around, they don’t seem to be solid ground, but the rough sea. The mud and rock fragments mixed with moss kept falling, and the fluctuations under the feet made people simply unable to stand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician instinctively squatted on the ground, waiting for the past of this earthquake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get up!" One hand grabbed the gold dress and slammed him directly with amazing strength. It is old Locke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Run fast, or it will be buried!" Old Locke shouted loudly, and at the same time pulled up Lev, who was also squatting next to Kim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Run!" he shouted. "This can't stand such a big shock!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Kim ran forward less than three steps, and there was a terrible huge sound coming from all around. The formation that has been hollowed out by artificial and natural forces has been unable to withstand such powerful forces and shakes up and down, and the whole collapses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The anger of the earth has finally stopped! Edward pushed hard to push the gravel and dirt on his body and stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is it now? He turned his head around, but there was only a piece of darkness nearby, and nothing could be seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Luke! Rayson!" He called the name of his companion loudly, but there was no echo around. He held his breath and couldn't feel any breathing in his ears. He and his companions were separated. I don't know how others are doing, I hope that the rocks that have not fallen will be buried alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edward fumbled forward. The changes just made him lose his sense of direction, and now he can only move forward with luck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quiet, surrounded by infinite silence, the body can not feel the flow of air, it seems that he fell into a living grave, the broken rock layer to bury It is. This kind of silence is so suffocating, and he can't stand it as a veteran fighter. The front is dark, it seems that this direction leads to eternity, he does not know how long he has gone, maybe ten minutes, maybe ten hours. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He unconsciously reached into his arms and touched the amulet. That was the gift his wife gave him when he was leaving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am waiting for you to come back and name the child!" Melia said to him with a smile. When he turned and walked, the girl caught up and added a sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be too reluctant!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that there is courage and strength through this itself only symbol The amulet of meaning passed to the body, so that his heart no longer trembled, and he stepped up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a dragon contract in the ruins that was transmitted by the adventurer's union. Anyone knows what it means! When humans were almost defeated by the Necromancers, it was the Dragons who defeated the Necromancers. If the Reiter empire masters the contract, then they can dominate the world - Delante can't make this happen anyway. Because of this, his father-in-law, the Emperor Nicholas of Delante, immediately responded by summoning a team of elite people to find a way to take it over before the Reiter Empire got the contract. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I must succeed!" He whispered to himself. He knows how much pressure Melia is taking! Although Nikolay had to admit them, but a princess actually ran away with a man of unknown mercenary, the brave girl had to face all the cold eyes and rumors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn!" The place where the hand touched was really a pile of rocks, and it seems that the intersection has been blocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edward was a bit frustrated, but he still reached out and pushed it. The stone is heavy and I don't know how thick the pile is. It seems that this is a dead end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, windy!" When the hand came back, suddenly he felt a flow of air. It was passed through the cracks in the rock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edward's spirit is strong, windy means that the roadblock is not too thick, and the opposite side should be a relatively large, air-flowing space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dark wind, see you!" He reached out and pulled out the magic sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Break!" With the loud sound of the rock being shattered, block The rock on the road collapsed as a whole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edward jumped to the side in time and was not hit by the flurry of stones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He succeeded, and the faint light that came in from outside was the best proof. Now he can see the situation outside, and as he estimated in advance, there is a huge space behind the pile of stones that seal the intersection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high rock hangs on the head, very high, at least tens of meters, here is a huge underground cavity, and he, and this The opening of one of the numerous small passages through which the holes communicate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although they are far apart, they still see the obvious artificial buildings. Here is the ancient city, the lost city that was forgotten by humans in the dynasty war - Daknis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edward accepts his thoughts of moving in that direction immediately, he must find a companion, or confirm that he can't find it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold looks at the fault behind him! He ran over and the rocky passage broke apart behind him. I don't know if he fell halfway down or stuck in the other side. In short, he is now a rock wall and he is separated from the others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vibrations around have stopped, and Kim walked back, knocking the new rock wall that was created by the slip of the hope. But this is futile, because the thickness of this rock wall is as difficult to penetrate as the "future." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician quickly determined that he had no choice but to move on along this path. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What will happen around you? When he was alone, Kim found himself with some guilty feelings. He added himself to the "guardian of the stars" and then proceeded to move forward, so that he could only be slaughtered when he suddenly jumped out of something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably more suitable for growth here, the unique plants of the underground world such as the vines are more in this area, making the surroundings brighter. While carefully observing the situation around him, Kim carefully moved forward. Not long after, he found himself in a large, unimaginable underground cavity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who!" Suddenly, a voice came, an old and majestic voice! Gold, which has always been watched, immediately turned to face the source of the sound, and the energy of the flame quickly condensed into a blasting ball in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man in a blue robe is facing him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How could it be you... Mr. Raymond?" Kim recognized the other. Yes, in front of him is lost in the mainland is considered to be the most powerful magician, Dick's court sorcerer, the great magician Raymond Sordo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it you? Kim?" After a brief recall, the Magi also recognized the young man who had a relationship with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So you want to get the contract of the dragon?" Jin asked to sit next to him. This elder. In just two years, Raymond's look slammed a lot and it looked really bad, but the eyes were still fascinating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!" Raymond’s sly answer "It’s all my fault. Now I have to take this responsibility! It’s my proposal to organize a large army to half-orcs. A big attack, so that this threat can be solved once and for all... But now..." The old man’s hand clenched his magic wand, but he could not suppress the excitement in his tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But...this is not your fault!" Kim originally wanted to tell him about the old Locke, and decided to not mention it after thinking about it. "The dwarves actually did not think of the Alliance with the Orcs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I must get the contract of the dragon!" Raymond said loudly. After the Northern Expedition, the Deco, just like a baby facing the wolf, was helplessly exposed to the army of the Orcs and Dwarves. The siege of the city of ice and snow has ended, and the coalition forces withdrew the day before. But what is the use of this? Deco’s half-country was cruelly embarrassed, and countless residents were displaced or taken away by the Orcs! This blow is definitely not recoverable in a short time. Even more frightening is that with this huge victory, the Orcs have begun to build a series of colonies in the north of Dicko! The ambition of the King of Tooth is clear, he will expel the human race and recapture the ancestral land. Other human countries, because they are confrontational and mutually restrained, have not given enough assistance to Dicco. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold wants to say something to comfort the old man, but finds himself can't say a word. Raymond’s blow was not something that could be comforted. In addition to the dangers facing the country, he had to face other griefs—he had four disciples who died in the terrible battle and could not find the bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are also looking for a dragon contract?" Raymond suddenly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah...Yes..." Kim did not expect the other party to raise the question suddenly, and some flustered answers.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you give it to me? "The old magician continues to ask gently.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm..." At this moment, how can Kim refuse this request?<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have rested enough, let's move on! Raymond stood up. Kim also stood up. He could see the gratifying expression on the face of the old magician, but it could not cover the exhaustion and sorrow of Raymond's eyes.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unable to see the figure around, after a circle, Edward found himself in front of a stone pillar group.< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Luke! He screamed again, but still didn't hear back. It seemed that there were no people around. Edward disappointed with these tall pillars and was about to turn and leave, but his sight caught a very important thing. Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first stone pillar is engraved with the mark that they are scheduled to be lost.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; there! "Edward was overjoyed. From the mark, at least two people were lucky to leave the disaster.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a passageway in front, but it is much more spacious than the one that comes out of it, but the terrain is uneven. There was a turn inside, and a little voice came from the turns, and it seemed that other people were waiting for themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edward ran over, but when he turned the corner, suddenly a black shadow came. He instinctively reached out and pulled the sword, but it was too late, and the body hit him in his arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah! Rayson!" Edward finally recognized the companion in front of him. He reached out to help each other, but the hand touched the other's silk robes and felt a warm damp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Running..." The magician said this in a weak voice, and the body fell in his arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the turn is still coming, and now you can notice, it is the fighting voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edward touched the heart of the companion and confirmed that the priest was dead. He gently put the body that had no life on the ground, and then grasped the dark wind in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He rushed over to the corner! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inside of the corner is very large, as big as a hall, and a large number of light vines stick out their roots from all over, and they shine brightly here. It seems to be the intersection of a rocky passage, but now it has become a slaughterhouse. Lying on the ground, all lying down were corpses, and a stone pillar in the middle was inserted with a bad luck that was forcibly thrown onto it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are at least twenty bodies around, and the last living person is sending out a wailing wailing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One body wearing full body armor, no, can’t be said to be worn, but it should be said that the tall man wrapped in steel armor is standing between the blood and the body. He straightened his right hand and grabbed the head of a wounded person who was struggling with the last struggle. The victim made a scream of heartbreaking, but the five fingers continued to strengthen their strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This person is the cruel swordsman who took the artifact from the dwarf, killing the killers of every attacker behind the adventurers, Wright The steel shackles seen by the lord's nest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh!" With the horror of the skull shattering, the screams stopped, and the injurer turned his face toward the newcomer and said a number. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Twenty-three!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man turned to Edward, the body clearly In the armor belonging to the human craft, only a pair of eyes that transmit icy murder are exposed. Although many of the corpses everywhere were opened by sharp weapons, this guy had empty hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are you?" Black Feather asked aloud, and put a defensive posture with a sword. But the other party did not answer, but strode forward to this side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are you?" Edward asked again. The other hand reached out a hand and there was any liquid ejected from the gap in the armor of his hand. The viscous liquid drooped down his gloves and formed a sword in a blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s the enemy and the friend no longer have to judge. "Dark!" With this voice, Edward launched the offensive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Too...too strong...how could it..." Edward Belt Unwilling eyes stared at the iron geek in front of him, but the fact is ruthless, the other party is completely unaffected by the dark wind power, and the sudden spurs determine the outcome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sword that flowed out of this weirdo body ruthlessly penetrated Edward's chest. He has always been proud of his speed, and as a result he has obtained the nickname of Black Feather. He has no chance of resisting the speed of the human reaction beyond the speed of human reaction. Even the dark wind has not yet smashed half, and the other's sword has been pierced. he. Everything happened at that moment, that is, when he flung himself, the other side was stabbed, and a sword defeated him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miliya came to him with a smile and took his Face, then gently kissed him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be too reluctant..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, Melia, I Can't name our child..." The body that was penetrated by the blade exhaled the last breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jianguang flying, after the other party’s body is soft, the sage He didn't stop, the long sword slid in the air until the body in front was cut into pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Twenty-four!" The cold voice rang again, then he turned his head and faced a new group of people who had just emerged from a passage. These four people have already seen the scene just now. The thief in front of him saw this horrible gaze swept over and frightened and stepped back a few steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It was the last time!" Behan has recognized this cruel butcher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two magicians flew to the city. This is Raymond's magic, because there are a lot of stone pillars in the middle, so the big magician thinks flying is the best choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Raymond!" Kim said. "Let's go find my companion first! With their help, it's much easier to find a dragon contract." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? Do you have a companion?" asked the old magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, the violent earthquake that just happened made us lost!" Kim replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's good..." Raymond's words have not been finished yet, a lightning bolt from the stone pillar forest under them, from the side of Raymond's body Over, hit the rock formations above their heads. The gravel fell, leaving the two people almost lost their balance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who?" In a blink of an eye, Raymond has responded before Kim has yet to restore balance. A green acid appeared in his hands, but he did not immediately launch a counterattack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A figure rises from below and wears a mage robe like both of them. The magician is in the middle of Raymond and Kim, but the powerful thunder is just enough to make him understand his strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who are you? Why suddenly attacked us..." Jin asked, he naturally thought that this person was also an adventurer like him. But his voice did not fall, Raymond launched an attack. When the acid bomb is shot, a detonation ball is added immediately behind it. The magic wave in front of the magic is chased in the middle. The acid after the explosion turns into a dangerous net and flies to this person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Get out of the way, Kim, he is not human!" Raymond shouted at the same time as he launched the attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the acid is blocked in the air like an invisible wall. Before Kim reacted to Raymond’s words, the other’s next attack was launched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without any spells, the two balls of light entangled in the electric light appeared in the other's hands, and the two gods of thunder swung over them like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold and Raymond each evaded and let this powerful magic fly by. This amazing ability just scared the gold jump. Someone can easily make such a powerful attack so easily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the dodge gap, Raymond also replied to the other side with a vacuum blade, but was blocked by the opponent's defensive magic as before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the surrounding wind elves began to weaken rapidly, and it was obvious that the other party used vacuum waves to break their flying magic, and the three bodies began to slowly land below. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s the Eight Eyes Devil!" Wei Yi recognized the other. There must be nothing wrong with this. This is the sorrow of the Eight-Eyed Devil. He recognized the hateful voice when he was inside the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other side stepped over to this side, and Wei stood up. In exactly the same way as before, when the last step of the attack range into the sword was taken, the other side suddenly stabbed a sword aimed at the chest with a naked eye. However, Wei had precautions. His body turned to the left side, and he was able to let the sword come, and at the same time, the demon sword was cut to the other's neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other three people can only look at one side and can't insert it completely. This is a battle that exceeds their grades. Both of them wear heavy armor, but the speed of each other is dazzling. The two long swords were picked, stabbed, wiped, smashed, and chopped, and they collided with each other in the air at an alarming high speed, attacking the flaws in the opponent's movement from various strange angles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entanglement war gradually began to separate the winners and losers, and Wei was clearly at a disadvantage. In any case, he is still a personal class after all, and it is impossible to maintain this kind of battle that requires a high concentration for a long time. Wei has now switched to a dual-handed sword, and it seems that there is only the power of parry, and there is no power to fight back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tie 傀儡 step by step, the strength of his sword is unbelievable, even if it is already holding the sword in both hands, each collision still makes Wei feel the arm A burst of vibration. Wei's opponent is simply a perfect combat machine, no matter the speed, strength, skill, and control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rewind, Wei! That is the Phantom Warrior, you can't win!" Old Locke yelled, but now Wei doesn't want to retire, but can't Retreat. His opponent is forced to be so tight, there is no chance to retreat. The enemy's epee dance is like a wind, and Wei Ping from all sides of the attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Use vindictiveness, retreat!" Old Locke yelled again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The violent temper is sprayed out and blows the ball back. Although the opponent apparently did not have any influence, Wei had already taken this opportunity to disengage and returned to the potholes they came before the other party caught up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright followed the Sayādaw to the tallest building in this underground city The doorway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A magical energy burst out suddenly, blocking them and the gates of the building. This is a clearly visible light blue glossy defensive ring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The guardian circle?" Brett was taken aback and didn't expect it to be protected by this. There are countless traps on this road - although most of the traps are simple traps consisting of one or two attacking magic, there aren't many really delicate magic traps - see what kind of environment the city was at the time. Abandoned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There must be a magical array that maintains the guardian circle, and it must be destroyed!" Brit’s words have not been said and swallowed back, because So he reached out and let his arm covered with cyan scales pass through the blue defensive magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cheat the three-year-old kid's stuff!" The laughter of the singer rang, and Brett saw some fear that the defense was rapidly disintegrating. The practice completely ignores the principle of magic, which is beyond the scope of his knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people walked into the door. There is no abnormality in the road below. Only in the door of the innermost room, there are two magical statues made by Seiko trying to make the last recalcitrant. But the Sayādaw is just a random wave, and these two faithful magic guards become the gravel on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Found it! It’s the most defensive core!" Pick up the golden box on the table in the middle of the room and open it. The paper in it is lying quietly inside. His ugly laughter echoed in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But Lord, why are you doing this?" Brett asked carefully. He has touched a little temper of the Supreme, and when the demon is proud, he always likes to show off his plans and abilities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You want to ask me why I want to make a channel for others to come in, right?" The sorcerer laughed, but the laughter changed into a sneer . “Because it is the place to entertain guests...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“No...” Just when Bright still couldn’t understand the meaning of the sage, the demon suddenly Start talking to myself. "There are too many channels, so it is not suitable... It seems that I have to change it so that the guests can only come in from one import... Hehehehe" He laughed again and then faced Bright. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no more thing for you here, go back! Try to maintain the Reiter empire, and let it collapse now and not meet my plan!" The waver waved impatiently, and Breit even disappeared into the air without even having the opportunity to speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the ground battle, Raymond is completely at a disadvantage. He can only open defensive magic and resist the constant blow of the enemy connection. The magic ability of the other side is too abnormal. The monster tactics are not so brilliant, but the amazing magic speed and endless magic are hard to suppress. Raymond has no ability to fight back. But the same, as long as Raymond stays in defense, the other side can't help them for a moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold can't get started, no matter what magic is immediately blocked by the opponent's powerful defense, it is better to use it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gold," Raymond whispered to the young people around him. "It’s not a way to drag it down here. I’m blocking it here. You think of a way to advanced city. Go find the contract of the dragon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician should have a voice, this is really not the way to go. Because as long as Raymond stays in defense, the opponent can't break his defense, just dragging the time in vain. However, the other side of the magic attack is as frequent, and suddenly can not find empty to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...The power of the palm of your hand...the guardian of space and time, please follow my request..." Raymond’s spell suddenly sounded, and Kim’s time was still Did not respond, the scene in front of the scene changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold suddenly turned back, only to find that he was separated from Raymond by a few hundred meters. Just this should be a short-distance momentary movement that can move things in the field of view. Although this magic can't be said to be very complicated, it is incredible to have precise control under such intense magical interference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go, don't worry about me, I don't care!" A voice was passed directly into Kim's mind. The magician hesitated a little and made the right choice. He slammed the opportunity that the other party did not notice, and under the cover of Shizhu, began to advance to the city of Dakos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Listen, Kim, if you can get the contract, don't worry about me, please send it to Dick as soon as possible!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay!" Watching Kim's body disappear into the stone pillar forest, Raymond sighed with relief, and then turned his face again. "Now let's continue!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We retreat back into the narrow cave, that The shovel also caught up. Old Locke immediately began to assign tasks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wei, you are blocking in front!" he shouted, then immediately turned to the swordsman, "Beihan, 趁 this opportunity, here is to play It’s time for the sword of the earth to be the most powerful!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behan immediately understood the intent of the old Locke, and the sword of the earth immediately penetrated the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The ground is rushing!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge force rushed out from all sides of the cave, Mixed with gravel impact on the shovel. Old Locke is right, this place can play the most powerful power of the Sword of the Earth, because it is the earth in all directions. Under this powerful impact, even the shovel could not stand it, and his body swayed and almost lost balance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Opportunity!" Wei Mengchong, the demon sword was cut down, the other side of the head, although the other side turned his head in time, but this cut down He had a small half helmet and even a small piece of scalp and half an ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half helmet fell to the ground, making a loud sound, and the other half also slipped down, revealing a face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah..." Wei made a sound that was not like a human voice. By slashing the light of the vine, you can see that face and Wei There are seven points similar, the difference is that there is a huge scar on the left eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Brother..." Wei’s voice mixed with surprise and fear. He recognized the face, or the face that belonged to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Wei was suspicious, the next attack came, the other party did not hesitate, and this opportunity was aimed at Wei’s neck position, and the speed was still fast. It’s as fast as it’s not affected at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the thieves have already rushed to the first step, and even Leif himself is wondering where this courage comes from. He grabbed Wei's back collar and pulled it to the side. Although he couldn't pull Wei all the way, it was enough for his body to move, and the position in this sword was turned into a breastplate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next wave of the Sword of the Earth has been attacked, preventing the possibility of the other party continuing to pursue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "See clearly, is he your brother?" Lev was also anxious. At this time, if Wei is finished, he will definitely not escape. "Look at his neck and face!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second wave of the sword caused by the sword of the earth is over, now you can see clearly, that face and neck There is a clear dividing line in the middle, the skin color of the upper and lower sides is completely different, and it belongs to different people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Listen, Wei!" Old Locke’s voice came from behind. "If you really love your brother, then don't let your hands go, let Your brother's body is freed from the control of His Holiness!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Locke looked at the front and he had already determined his victory. Although this phantom warrior can be described as horrible, it is only a flaw. He does not know that he should temporarily retreat in order to choose a place that is beneficial to him. It will only be brave but stupid. Under the double attack of the sword of Wei and the earth, it is impossible to be spared. No matter how powerful the power, without wisdom and judgment, it is not worth fearing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have already chopped the armor of this opponent piece by piece with the support of Wei Beihan. As in the imagination, the tall body of the other is constructed from the limbs of different people, and the difference in skin color between them is very obvious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wei," Old Locke issued a timely guidance. "The phantom warrior's ability to regenerate is very strong, and he must be completely shredded before he regenerates!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But this sentence has not been said much, with the next impact of Behan, Wei also issued a real attack. Each sword is cut down along the skin color boundary, and in the few seconds when the opponent is shocked and slightly slow, the demon sword will dismember him into the initial state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last sword was cut from the neck and cut the line of skin color accurately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ongoing attack has been going on for an hour, but the other side’s magic is Not seen at all. Still a magic and a magical stream swooped over. Raymond also tried to use the consuming tactics, using the defensive magic consumption is far less than the attack magic to consume the other side's magic, it seems that this plan is unsuccessful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now there seems to be no good way, he has lost the opportunity, and the opponent’s defensive magic is something he doesn’t know, and he can’t launch it for the time being. Counterattack. Raymond tried many times to directly rebound the opponent's magic to counterattack, but most of them did not hit the other side, but hit the rock at the top of the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An invisible barrier suddenly appeared between the two battle figures, the opponent's attacking magic was all blocked, and then a voice came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two, please don't be so excited. This will destroy this site! I don't think you want to cause the whole collapse here!" With the figure, A man with a short beard and a white gown, the tall old magician appeared behind a stone pillar about twenty meters from them. If Kim is still here, he will definitely recognize this as his teacher, the great magician Xiu Ke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With the power of two..." Shuke’s words stopped because the old man also understood that Raymond was not facing humanity. Although the appearance looks really like it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah!" A hot wave hits the head, and the Master sees another target appearing, launching the attack without hesitation, his power is beyond the thunder Meng estimates that it is easy to attack two people at the same time. Moreover, the attack on Raymond was not affected at the same time. The wizard's magic is fast and powerful, and almost every magic has overlapped several times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, it is not unreasonable that Xiu Ke should not fight. He quickly opened his defensive magic, and now the two old magicians stood on the same front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are you?" Raymond’s heart suddenly showed a signal, very Obviously it is the spiritual connection from the person who just joined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Raymond Sordo?" The spirit fluctuated and seemed to be a surprise for the name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, are you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am honored to meet, my name is repair, repair ·K. I don’t think we have any time to be polite at this time, or join hands to solve this problem first... Is this guy a phantom warrior who guards this site?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "No, he is York Ray - the court magician of the Reiter Empire. I have seen him once... Anyway, we both seem to have to deal with it!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two great magisters are admiring each other for a long time, and the simple spiritual exchange immediately makes them form a united front. The two of them began to approach each other, and then Raymond walked into the defensive magic of repair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is that guy?" Someone who was surprised to ask Raymond, can create a phantom warrior that attacks this intensity, but at the same time It’s been a long time to hold back the power of the two great magisters, and I can’t believe it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know. I only saw it from a distance when I went to Leiter last time...if it wasn't this time it suddenly attacked me. I can't see it at all. It's not human... You are responsible for defense, let me attack!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good!" Answer, doubt first put On the one hand, defeating this cricket is the most important thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three great magisters lost on the mainland launched a magical battle outside the underground city. Now the two sides are coming and going, and they seem to be evenly matched. But in general, it is only in the consumption of magic, no one can give the other party a fatal blow to end the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A light bomb was bounced off by the Master’s defense, flying up to the top of the rock, and the gravel fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How to save the magic, is in full defensive, but he is also observing each other at the same time, the other's defense surprised him, no matter what type of elemental magic, or Space magic, all blocked by this apparently the same defense. He noticed that several small stones were found on the sorcerer's body when the gravel fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His defensive weakness is on the head! The top part of his head does not seem to defend against physical attacks." Shuai calmly told Raymond, who is responsible for the attack, "use Try the strongest attack magic!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Awaken the power of ancient taboos from the dark abyss..." Raymond gave up the other's small Frequent attacks, began to slowly read a long spell. "... Let death and destruction cover the earth...Build a deep glaciers, use your power to freeze the blood and hands and feet of my enemies..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A white frozen The gas began to encircle the Master, and the surrounding rocks and the ground were all condensed with a layer of frost. The other party ignored it and issued three bursting balls in a row, but when they passed through the freezing air, these flames disappeared completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Blade of Ice and Snow!" The power of magic broke out, and in a moment, the temperature was lowered at a high speed, and a large piece of land around the Master was completely frozen, in the air. The water condenses into a huge icicle that extends from the ground to the top of the rock and freezes his entire body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Successful!" Xiu Keke breathed a sigh of relief. But at this time, the sound of the cracking of the ice came, and the Master broke free from the icicles, his power broke out, and the icicles were broken into pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A huge and sharp ice cone falls, piercing from the top of his head while the wizard is about to use magic, running through his body and putting his entire body Nailed to the ground. This is a trap. Raymond has consciously divided the icicle into two parts when constructing magic. This is the key blow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;York’s body is beginning to shine, the magic he is brewing is no longer able to be emitted, the power of loss of control is exploding in his body, piercing him with his body The body's ice cones are fried together into pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Successful!" Raymond couldn't help but touch his forehead. This is really a bit of luck. From the very beginning, the opponent’s monotonous and powerful attack can judge the other party’s magic power, and the magic speed is amazing, but it should not have much combat judgment. However, if he does not have the responsibility to suddenly appear and assume the defense, he alone cannot complete the trap just now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the two great magisters can have time to look at each other. How to say it, because both sides have heard of each other's names, they know each other's existence, and they all have admiration. I met this time, and this is the first time I saw the other person’s words. It’s not so much that they are the first time to meet, they are friends who have been friends for a long time. Raymond has always admired the ability to put down everything and concentrate on the study of magic, while the repairing heart also praised Raymond for bravely taking on the responsibility of the state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the two people didn’t even have a chance to formally ask, and a voice came from the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who defeated my servant? This powerful force should be respected!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The space was distorted, and the robes of the black robes appeared in front of the two great magisters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Brother..." Wei stood in front of the pit just filled, slowly mourning the long-lost relatives. He has no other choice. Here is the only mud land nearby. He used a magic sword to dig a pit and buried his loved one's head. The other parts belonging to the Phantom Warrior are stacked with other bodies. They don't have time to help these people bury them, they can only be put together symbolically so that later people can see them. Or later can bury these dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't be sad, Wei!" Behan walked to Wei, but he couldn't say anything else. He saw Wei's hand once clenched into a fist, but slowly loosened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right!" Behan asked the old Locke sitting on the side. "You just said that the guy is a 'phantom warrior', what the hell is it?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The limit of the law!" Old Locke whispered, "just like the magical statues we have seen, but he is made of human body." They are a lot more flexible than those stone statues, but they are not inferior in strength... as long as they have enough time and patience, they can even let them master the magic. But the most terrible thing is that the makers can attach their will to them at any time. It can be seen as the avatar of the manufacturer, so it is called the phantom warrior. This is because the wickedness is banned in the dynasty dynasty. But..." Old Locke turned to look at the bodies on the pile of corpses. Pieces. "Combining the bodies of different people in a mess into a new phantom warrior... I saw this for the first time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We walked over and hit Broken the old Locke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's go. Let's go find the gold!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He takes the lead to the exit Go, old Locke thought about it, and took a piece of paper from the pocket and stuck it on the rock wall. On paper is some symbol written by some glowing powder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lev picked up the magical sword from Edward's body and shook it. Then he found that the sword was also rejecting his control, so he picked up the scabbard on the corpse and put the sword in his backpack. He noticed the actions of the old Locke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is this? Lev carefully looked at it. It was a thick piece of paper, and some of the glittering small particles made up a pattern on the paper. This figure reminds Lev of the time when he left Undead Island. This figure is like the space that Nubis sent them to send magic array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hurry up. Lev!" The call came from afar, dispelling Lev's curiosity. He responded and the run followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold is now walking alone in the streets of this ancient city, he is very Be careful. Old Locke told him that the city was abandoned in the war. In order not to be occupied by the enemy, the residents ruined all the common magic passages before retreating, and then placed layers of traps in the city to meet the enemies that did not actually arrive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are traces of magical destruction everywhere, and they are all new. It seems that there was something forced to pass through this area not long ago, leaving a mess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold has some stunned checks for traces of a broken trap. This is the illusion trap that Nubis introduced to him, but it is now violently destroyed by violence. Kim self-evaluated and found that if he entered this trap if he was caught off guard, he would probably not be able to come out. In the combination of paralysis and illusion, the trapper thinks that he is moving on, but he has actually been paralyzed, and he will continue to advance in the illusion until he dies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I promised Raymond’s request, Kim really didn’t think so much. Now the magician is scared. It’s really scary. After all, he can’t compete with the Lord. He started to stand on the road and hesitated. Can't decide whether to move on or should turn back to meet with partners and Raymond. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a brief hesitation, the wizard decided to move on. After all, time is very urgent, if the Sayādaw gets the dragon contract first, then things will be difficult. Although it is very dangerous, in a sense, this level of danger is not as good as fighting the Dragons or taking the contract from the Supreme. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Holding this idea, Kim carefully follows the trap of destruction. There were no signs of Sayādaw along the way until he saw the building opened by the gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold does not have much knowledge of architecture, he can only infer from common sense. In general, the tallest building in the city is the most important building, and the opening of the hole - along the way, almost all the houses are closed, except those that have been destroyed - - It means that someone has gone in. If there is anyone coming here all the way and opening the door, then there is only the sage. When Kim was hesitating, there was a sudden sound of earth-shattering, and a strong vibration came from his feet, as if it was another great earthquake, but the shock stopped immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold looked around, but those buildings blocked his view and made him unable to see anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The direction of this vibration seems to be the direction in which Raymond and the monster fight - perhaps the great damage caused by their magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the heart is full of an ominous feeling, but Kim still has enough courage, now is not a time to back down. He added "shadow" to himself - this magic can make his body invisible, unless it is deliberately sought, otherwise it is difficult to see, but obviously it will not be useful to the sage - then walk door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s very quiet around, it seems that only Kim’s own heart is jumping. Gold tries to lower the footsteps as much as possible, and chooses to follow the path of the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"咚咚..." A slight impact came, the sound was very light, but the gold in the alert state was very clear. He immediately judged that the sound came from the ground, and something was hitting the wooden floor under his feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"咚...咚......" The sound rang again, and the golden hand slammed into the room of the sound source. He curled up his body as much as possible, and a magic was in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knocking sounded for the third time, this time changed to a position. Then, under the gaze of Kim, a mouth suddenly opened on the wall, and the old Locke came out, followed by other companions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah..." Kim’s surprise sounded, and he stood up, but before he could do anything, Lev had pulled out his knife and told him Mammoth. The flying knife passed over the edge of his ear, and his cheeks numb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a minute, it’s me!" Wei has already rushed over this time, the sword is dancing, and he quickly smashes it. Fortunately, Kim promptly screams, otherwise This is dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gold?" After hearing his voice, Wei promptly took the sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's me!" The magician remembered that the invisible state of his body had not been lifted. There is not only one who is nervous, but also the partners. The nerves have reached the limit. It is no wonder that an abnormal voice is heard and the attack is launched immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How did you come?" Kim lifted the state of stealth and asked Lev, who was wiping a cold sweat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know a shortcut..." Old Locke answered. "If there is any problem, let’s talk about it, we have to be fast, otherwise it might be too late." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's too late!" A familiar and horrible voice came. Everyone looks at the source of the sound - I don't know when, the sage has already appeared at the door of this room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You come for this thing!" The sage shook his right hand holding a box. Surprisingly, the black cloak he wore had no right sleeve at the moment, and his arms covered with cyan scales were clearly displayed in front of five people. The box in his hand is golden, but there is no decoration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Eight eyes demon!" Wei lined up everyone, and one person walked up. His eyes were filled with fanatic anger at the moment, and it looked like an injured beast. He exudes a strong murderousness mixed with anger, and the single person walks toward the demon! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold noticed that Wei had already taken out the magic crystal that the old Locke gave him, and pinched it to his left hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You actually play with my brother's body like that..." He yelled, "I want to avenge my loved ones..." with the last one The sound, he rushed up, almost leaving the afterimage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demon sword is cut off in the front, but the body of the Sayādaw disappears when the sword arrives. His body appeared in the hall outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Revenge? Hehehehehehe..." The frog inside the box called again. "This kind of words, only the strong can say! You Do you have this qualification? Forget it, I just prepared a program for you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop!" Wei wildly rushed again, he began to appear The precursor of the mad warrior, the murderous body exuded by the body made the companions behind him feel depressed, but could not shake the demon in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold they rushed out of the room, just to see the light from the hands of the Eight-Eyed Devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We looked at the light, and the murderousness of the body began to weaken. The magician immediately recognized what the Zun is doing, which is farsighted magic, a kind of magic to watch the distant situation, but usually use a crystal ball or a mirror to use the medium as a mediator. It has never been seen in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that group of lights, Mink’s body is clearly displayed. She is obviously in a coma, but it really makes Wei stop, so that Jin Jinhan is the environment she is in now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mink’s body lies in a transparent crystal cabinet filled with green acid. There is now an invisible barrier that is protecting her, keeping the acid out. Old Locke, Behan, Lev, three people also looked, but they are not the same as Kim, do not understand the meaning of the Supreme. Lev was vaguely familiar, but he couldn't remember who it was. Mink's hair is scattered, a complete female posture. If you don't know, who can think of this woman as the boy? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to do?" Wei's voice passed through a stiff throat and then passed through the tight teeth. The hatred in the voice sounds numb to the scalp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I killed your companions, I let her go!" The voice of the Sayādaw sounded from hell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No!" Wei suddenly became angry, but he did not act rashly. "I definitely don't compromise... You are the demon, I am not the enemy of you, you can't threaten me in any way!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh... ..." The Sayādaw smiled, but the ugly laughter revealed the biting ice. "That's good, I am satisfied with your wishes!" The light of the group was even stronger, and the situation of Mink was clearly revealed. The golden box didn't know when it was hidden by him. His scaled hands made a complicated symbol in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No..." The invisible barrier disappeared with the movement of the Sayādaw, and the green acid rushed into the girl's body, instantly engulfing the body. Through the translucent green liquid, you can clearly see that Mink's skin is quickly dissolved, and then you can see the original beautiful and beautiful face, revealing the white bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei Meng rushed up, anger has completely overshadowed his reason, he has become a Berserker. At this moment he was replaced by a double-handed sword, and the storage magic crystal did not know where it was thrown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sage looked coldly at the opponent who rushed up, and extended a hand to point him at him...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Everything is so sudden, in a blink of an eye, the whole situation has changed, and even the companions who are ready to go are too late to intervene. Wei only rushed two steps, and even the sword's attack range had not yet entered and fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warrior fell to the ground and made a painful voice, full of pain and unwillingness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to kill you... I must kill you!" The saints stepped on Wei's back, but Wei had no chance to struggle, but he could only make a painful but helpless cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But I won't kill you now!" Sayādaw looked at the man who stepped under his feet and spoke in the tone of a proud winner. "You not only disturbed my important experiments, but also hurt my body. This sin will be redeemed with the pain of a lifetime! Your body has been hurt by the hammer of the god of war, and the wound made by the artifact will never heal. As long as a little stimulation will break out immediately...so you can't have the chance to overcome me in your life... Hahaha... Because I am so happy to see you, so I will let you go today!"< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Supreme kicked Wei’s body to Behan, who immediately lifted the warrior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, the appetizer is over, the main dish is on the scene!" The Sayādaw turned his face to the old Locke of Kim, and then sneered at it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Holy Light, Welcome!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Holy Light?" Kim Surprised Again Turned to look at the old Locke, but Locke did not say anything. His face was pale and his body was trembling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The most powerful magician in the legend of mankind...had defeated the heroes of the high-level goblins, created the magical dynasty, how are you scared? Live After so many years, has it made you feel embarrassed and useless? Look, can destroy my demon sword is not already around you, why not? Hehehehehehe..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sayādaw laughed and seemed to be scared by the old Locke in the wilderness of the Orcs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Locke kept silent, and suddenly, when the sinister laughed and was unprepared, he threw a thing that was last used. Thunder hit the ball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demon held out a hand to stop, but the ball suddenly exploded, and the free thunder rushed out excitedly, bringing a huge electric The column, the demon was hit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go!" Old Locke yelled and pulled Lev, who was farthest from him, to his side. His right hand then found a magic crystal from the bag in his waist. Then, with a burst of space, the five of them disappeared in front of the Sayādaw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leif is coming back, the old move of Old Locke has sent them Go back to the starting point just now. It is also the place to fight with the shovel of the Supreme. The piece of paper is shining, but only for a short while, the light disappears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wei, are you okay?" Kim looked at the warrior who was lying on the ground. At the moment, Wei Zheng looked at everything with a stunned look. There is a demon curse on him - it was intended to let Elna's mother get rid of it, but it was extended because of the involvement of the old Locke - the injury on the shoulder was slowly recovering, and this injury temporarily lost him. Ability to act, but no life-threatening - mental damage is really serious compared to the damage of **. Wei is now in an unconscious state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We don't have time, he will definitely catch up!" Old Locke said loudly to Kim, "You must use one more moment to move away from here. I only have For an instant movement, you must immediately re-deliver the magic to the magic crystal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gold turned over, and the old Locke seemed very anxious at this time. He took over the crystal of the magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gold, hurry, we must leave immediately..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But...but ..." Kim really hates why he doesn't have space magic. His momentary moving magic can only work through the magical array on his body, and it cannot be placed in the magic crystal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves in the air began to fly and proved that the power of a magic has been extended here. Kim has seen this situation in the treasure house of Delante. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s too late!" Old Locke understood that he had miscalculated. The Sayādaw catches up much faster than I thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Under the Holy Light, you are running really fast!" The body of the demon appeared in front of the adventurers. The black cloak on the Eight-Eyed Devil has been turned into a blackout in the previous lightning strike. Now he stands in front of five people with a true face. Kim once saw it once on Long Island, but this time it was a real positive look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of the sage is very similar to a lizard, but the scales are smaller and finer than the lizards. His head minister has several forks that resemble a horn, and his body has four pairs of eyes on the front. Four on the head, but the eyes above are closed and look like eyebrows. There is a pair of chest and lower abdomen. But the whole image is not so much a horror as it is a sense of courage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, but your speed is not slow." Old Locke went up, facing the Sayādaw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can only rely on you, Lev! Yours, because you are not a threat to him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leif tried every means to suppress the fear that was almost impossible to restrain, slowly Close to the devil and then circle behind him. And as Old Locke said, the Sayādaw did not respond to him, just as he did not see him at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leif is very nervous, he wants to drop the papers in his hands more than once, then run away, running away from this demon, but every time He has overcome this idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has no weapons in his hand, only three pieces of paper that Old Locke gave him. These thick pieces of paper are engraved with a lot of magic crystal particles to form a magical array, but this magical array is completely different from the one used by Old Locke to locate the momentary movement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put these papers on the Supreme, this is the task that Old Locke gave him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happens to the consequences? Leif did not think about it. The only thing he prayed was that the old Locke’s judgment was correct. The Sayādaw only regarded him as a small, at any time. A bug that can be killed with an ankle will not have any precautions against his actions. As long as the Supreme has such a little suspicion, or if he is only on the rise, Leif will say goodbye to the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Locke is taking a sentence and the Eight Eyes Devils delay the time. The Sayādaw is not in a hurry to start, he is like a cat, and does not want to kill the prey that is destined to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leif is as close as possible, and then he has all the courage to rush. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil extended his hand toward Lev with an elegant and quick movement. Power spurted out of his hand, and a beam of light ruthlessly hit Lev's chest and fluttered the whole person he fought like a leaf until it hit the wall. The thief fainted, but he also succeeded, because while he was throwing, he flew three pieces of cardboard caught in his fingers to the sage. The devil concentrated his power on his chest, ignoring the little movement of his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Quick, gold!" Old Locke yelled, and the magician who had already prepared himself immediately accumulated what he had just accumulated, overlapping the fourteen paralysis - - This time, the effect of adding the magic crystal - immediately released, and the sages suddenly got this trick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened?" The Eight-Eyed Devil looked at his body with some disbelief. His body was paralyzed and unable to move. It should be said that his anti-magic ability is amazing. He has overlapped with fourteen times of paralysis and can still speak and turn his head, but his body has lost his ability to move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Quick! Use the thunder!" Old Locke loudly reminded the magician. The sage is only temporarily trapped by the magic squad. This is not going to last long. The magical squad is similar to the half-orc’s magical handcuffs that Kim has ever enjoyed. It is used by it, and even the sages can’t use magic for a while. But the magic of saving in those tiny magic crystals is that it is impossible to support for too long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold does not hesitate to start his mantra. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am in the distance of the darkness, calling for the elves of light to come... Cut the powerful power into the hands of the gods in charge of them... Thunderbolt opens! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thunderbolt is interwoven into a huge net, swirling in this narrow cave space. In the nearby atmosphere, Lei Jing was cursed and summoned, intertwined with each other, and huge energy shrouded the body of the Sayādaw. Although there is no such thing as a huge thunder that can be called from the sky as in the city of Hope, the violent electric light echoing in the air is constantly bombarding the sage of the sage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is it possible!" Old Locke couldn't believe it, and he understood why. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s an elemental covenant! It’s over...” Old Locke murmured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Locke’s voice reached the ear of Kim, and then he knew why this curse could not hurt the Savior. The sage must also master the mystery of the elemental covenant. As long as he transforms the body into the property of the thunder, then the squad can not damage him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only take the risk!" Kim bit his teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The ancient forces contained in the atmosphere, please listen to my request..." Although the body alone can not withstand the body, but gold is still Started the second spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop, gold, you can't take it, you will die!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... ... turned into the wind... turned into dust... All power is added to me! Look at the move, the sage! The wind blows the thunder!” The magician forcibly endured the body’s pain because of the unbearable The two curses are combined into one spatial extent. At the same time attacked by two forces, the elemental covenant can only let him avoid one! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Awful stinky boy!" The roar of the sage came, and his body was being ruthlessly torn and cut by the raging wind elf. The roar of the demon reverberated throughout the cave, and even the terrible roar of the curse could not overwhelm his voice. The three magical arrays on his body have been shattered by the wind, but he can't escape the cage of the cursed structure. He is now resisting with vindictiveness, but the interval between two vindictiveness, the wind ruthlessly cuts his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The capillaries of gold begin to rupture, first the hand, then the face. The blood was squeezed out of his blood vessels, and he converges along his skin into a stream, staining his gray mage robe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pain of physical pain seems to be broken by what power, but Kim still maintains two curses. The body of the Sayādaw is being torn apart and become thinner and thinner. Suddenly, his vindictiveness could not be maintained, and then his entire body fell under the savage curse, and it was torn into pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Successful..." When the body finally broke, Kim could not support it. He fell to his head and fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The violent curse slowly disappeared after the defender fell, and Beckham, who was hiding in Leif, was also crawling out. Only the shards of the demon king were left on the ground, and they won and defeated the sage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gold! Gold!" Old Locke swayed the magician's dying body, his movements were fast, while he continued to shake him, keeping his mind awake I immediately took out a small bottle from the pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold liquid pours on the face, making the magician feel refreshed. This is a bottle of holy water, which not only washed away the blood on the gold face, but also quickly contracted his wounds and stopped the blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it successful?" The magician asked Old Locke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have succeeded!" Old Locke's face was a joy. The body of the Sayādaw was cut into pieces that could not be pieced together. Although he must be born again, it would take at least ten days and a half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Found it!" Behan excitedly ran to the front of Kim, who held the box in one hand and a book in the other. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The one of the sages left these two things!" He laughed and handed the things to the old Locke. Kim recognized that this is the magic book that was taken away by the sages in Durant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Lock took the box and placed it on the side of the body, but put the magic book in the gold pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is what you deserve, gold!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Right, just now Say you..." The magician stopped when he said half of it. His eyes were wide and his face was full of horror and incredible expression. Kim with one finger behind Behan, his mouth opened, but he couldn't speak! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A huge gem is floating in the air, and an arm has been born from this gem. Cyan, arms covered with scales. And that flesh and blood is growing rapidly, and soon a prototype of the body is constructed. The first generated arm waved, and the old Locke didn't react for the time—a light that melted the box that had not been destroyed by the curse into a metallic liquid, and the dragon's contract was annihilated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Behan!" Kim yelled out, but nothing was used. The body of the swordsman was cut open by this power, and the body became The two sections of incompleteness, half of the chest and the entire abdomen disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The restoration of the sage is faster than the old Locke’s imagination, everything is turned over again, and the victory that has already arrived suddenly becomes a bubble disappearing, and Failure and death are heavily pressured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gold!" Another voice came, and Kim turned to look at him and saw his teacher coming out of a passage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher! How are you here..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;修克White mage robe, but the chest part of this robe has been dyed red by the blood flowing out of his mouth. He was hurt! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher...you're okay..." Jin struggled to sit up, but the curse of the previous spell was too big for his body, his The effort failed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing!" The footsteps of Shuk came over from there. "One day that really impressed me, I first met the admiration that I have always admired. Raymond Sordo, who didn't have a chance to meet, then saw the real magic!" He smiled on his face, but he couldn't hide the whiteness of his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Raymond? Then he..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He also saw the real magic !" repair gram while walking and answering. "I didn't expect to have such a powerful magical power... We humans are really just the frogs at the bottom of the well... The demon... is this reason so called the demon?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I have no regrets in my life..." Suk went to Kim's side, bent over and touched Kim's face, and then took off a ring from his hand and handed it to Kim. The magician recognizes this ring, this is the work that Shuke has been trying to make, the space ring that can move instantly - the work that imitates the space operation ball - now that he has put this ring on his hand, it means this thing Has been successful. He took the ring after Kim took it and continued to move forward, while continuing to say. "Human life is limited, that is, the use of magic can not be extended! I have lived for a few years, even if the research can not study how many famous..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Teacher...what are you doing!” Kim finally woke up from the shock of the beginning, and understood the meaning of Shuo Ke’s words. He cried with a cry. Old Locke looked at this scene with awkwardness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing!" He answered, his tone was full of calm. "Just do one teacher's duty. One teacher, always pull a disciple at a critical time!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't! Teacher!" Magician Shouting, but his teacher did not stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gold, you listen, as evidenced by my own words, I, Xiu Ke, the owner of the Stone Tower, will all the property of the Stone Tower Handed over to my only apprentice: Kim Cali!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The avatar’s arm shot another death light, but failed to hit the old magic. division. Shuk went to the body that was constantly growing new flesh and blood, and then looked back at Jin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be careful to take care of yourself, gold!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a twist in space The old magician disappeared in front of the two together with the meat group that was recovering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can't you?" Kim whispered to Erna. The latter nodded silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I really can't do anything!" Elna said blankly, and then handed the sword of the earth that had been folded in half to Kim's hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kim Momo took over the broken sword, and the sword had reached the final responsibility, guarding its master to the last moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original Pioneer’s unrivalled Jianfeng has become brilliance and has become a two-stage scrap iron. The magician gently stroked it and then received them in his own package. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Would you like to take it?" Elna whispered, her voice with a heavy sense of guilt, just for the moment of retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No need to...I am buried in the temple, the Count of Fatt will be satisfied..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Are you going back alone?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well... please let Wei live in the temple for a while, he needs to be quiet now..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reassure, my mother has nothing to do..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Locke appears in the distance Kim immediately turned around and planned to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait a minute, Kim, I have something to say to you!" cried Old Locke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Enough!" Kim turned and shouted loudly. " Needless to say!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know that you are very upset, but this is an inevitable sacrifice..." Old Locke’s words have not been finished yet, and Kim is a big man. Interrupted his words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Inevitable sacrifice? This is the result of your plan! Which plan did you achieve? We succeeded? You said to recapture The dwarf's artifacts prevent them from joining the Orcs. We did it, and went to the Royal Palace with you to stand guard for you - but the result? Deco fell to the iron hoof of the Orcs! You said to be in the Lord. Before we grab the dragon contract, we want to go with you. We did it, and brought you all the way to Dakenis. The result? You destroyed Wei! You said let us set a trap, use the curse Smash the Sayādaw, we did it - the result? Not only accompanied Behan, but also my teacher! Enough, really enough! I have had enough, now I have to go back to the Behan family, put The news of his death told his father that we will not meet again in the future, and anything about you is irrelevant to me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician said the sooner, It seems as if the anger and sorrow accumulated in the heart are to be vented together. In fact, the old Locke is not wrong, but the feelings of the magician need to vent.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You release the news of the dragon contract, but do you know how many people died for this? Mr. Meng is dead, my teacher is dead! They wouldn’t have died, they wouldn’t die! Even the half-orc dwarves and the dragons will attack together...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You killed them!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Locke quietly listened to the words of gold, no rebuttal. His calm face made Kim feel a guilty conscience, and the feverish mind just calmed down a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry..." The magician paused and whispered apologetically. "Mr. Locke...just... I was so excited just now..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician turned and left, his feet on the floor tiles hate the heavy sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, Mr. Locke...Gold him..." Elna looked at Kim and left and turned to apologize to Old Locke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter..." Old Locke whispered. "There is indeed my fault here!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold walks down the steps of the temple. He I remember when I arrived, there were three people. No, four people went up together, but now it is a person. Wei has already lost, completely lost the spirit of the past, drinking all day! Babe is missing, And Behan is already a member of the tomb outside the temple.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician touched his parcel and suddenly found that he did not know How to deal with Liss who stayed in Studdin, and the Count of Fatt. If they knew the death of Behan, what would they do? But this is the responsibility, since he and Behan are going out, he must be to him. The family made a reply.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Locke walked into the ruins of the shrine at the bottom, and the necromancer appeared from one side and greeted him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That kid is too much! Respect the teacher! He actually said that!" Nubis bowed his head to the old Locke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No...Nubis, I think we have all lived for too long... I have forgotten how much pain he has to bear now...he is really It’s very young! Right, what's going on with me?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Most has been done, please wait a little longer. But... ..." Nubis asked hesitantly. "Do you really think so?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remember the book? You show it to me! A warrior defeated the devil!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have always committed a The mistake is to try to use magic to defeat the sage... There is no more magic in the world than the devil!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..."< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remember? There is a winged man and a tauren in the heroes, and a half-orc... If the unnamed mage was fighting with magic, then Why would you choose Some races that are not good at magic?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The count is there?" Come to the door of the luxurious bureaucrat and ask the servant who is guarding the door. The latter recognized the identity of Kim after a little bit of attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Please let me know first." The servant politely bowed and then turned and went in. He will come out again after a short time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Lord is waiting for you in his study room upstairs!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold step by step Going up the stairs, you will get one more point for each uneasiness in your heart. He did not dare to go to the military camp outside the city to see Lisi, can the half goblin withstand such a blow? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold opened the door, Count Fade was sitting at his desk waiting for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My bastard son told you to bring back the news?" Kim had not spoken before the count began. "I don't think it's a good thing anyway!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s not that Behan called me!" Jin Jingjing’s answer, his tone and expression revealed the message. Let the count of the count change. The magician took a step forward and took out the sword of the earth that had been broken in his package and placed it on the table of the count. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Count of Fatt looked at the broken sword in the ground for ten minutes, then looked up at Kim’s face. He seems to be indifferent, but Kim sees the sorrow and the wave of feelings that are almost coming up from the depths of his eyes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is he dead like a hero?" asked the count. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Yes, the death is very strong..." Kim replied. The count listened to this and leaned back. With this simple movement, his appearance suddenly reveals the state of the dragon clock, as if he had been ten years old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Also...the half-fairy is already pregnant, and our family is still a successor. As long as he does not humiliate our doorstep!" Earl faint Said. Then he turned the seat along with the body to the side. No longer look at gold positively, it seems to be a disgusting messenger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold looked at the gorgeous glass lamp holder placed behind the count. This thing reveals the truth to the magician - the crystallized highlights are appearing on the count's eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold exited the room backwards. As he walked out and took the door, there was a faint cry in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Jin Jingjing came out, thinking only the eyes of the count just now. It was the sorrow of a father who lost his son. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I think of my father, Kim immediately thinks of his hometown, remembers his neighbors, and his parents and brothers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go back! Go and see the family..." When Kim stepped out of the door of the building, he decided his goal. His adventure life... It should be a temporary passage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lost Continental calendar 999 years, this year is destined to be recorded in history books In the middle of the year, there have been so many major events. During the year, the Reiter empire regained its position after losing nearly a hundred years in the southwestern territory. The Red Alliance has lost its status as an independent country and has incorporated this rejuvenated old empire as a vassal state. In the same year, the rich and powerful Victor Emperor re-established by Leite was violently ill at the age of 56. On the same day that the emperor died, a major earthquake occurred near the capital city of Leite, causing a tens of kilometers of cracks in the suburbs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s not as big as the big chaos in the North. After almost a year of preparation, the northern powers Dike sent a large army to attack the half-orcs across the half-orc wilderness in retaliation for the Southern invasion of the upper half of the orcs. However, the army of Dike was attacked by the army of half-orcs and dwarves in the wilderness, and the whole army was wiped out. The coalition forces won the attack, and all the way was like a broken bamboo. It swept across the entire north of Dicco and continued to take troops under the ice city of Dicco. The shock caused by this war far exceeds the failure itself, because this is the first time humans have faced the real threat of aliens since the Liberation War. When the news spread throughout the country through the adventurer's union, it caused a panic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, for the residents of the city of Rohr in Raftwar, there has been no real change in the days. Half-orcs, wars, and earthquakes are only a period of discussion about this relatively remote place, and then they are no longer mentioned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This day is a normal day without any difference in the past, the only blacksmith shop in the village of Sidico - this is the only blacksmith shop outside the city - Open the door in the morning as usual, and the blacksmith Xiwei removes his small sign from the inside, put it at the door, and starts working. Since his store became a medium store, he changed his name to Xiwei, the name of the richest man in the city, meaning self-evident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His blacksmith shop has been open for almost two years, from the beginning of the stall to the upgrade to the current shop took longer. In the area of ​​the city of Rohr, it is a big thing to open a shop. No one in the vicinity has been ignorant. His craft is OK, and the price is fair, so as long as it is not a special reason, the metal utensils of the village next to it are sent to repair here. For a young man in his twenties, being able to own a shop—although he didn’t hire any deputy—has been a remarkable achievement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are not many things today. There is only a broken shovel to repair, and there is also a pickaxe that the guest requested, so he was not busy after opening the door. Work, but sit there for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A figure appears on the door of this small shop. This is a foreigner with luggage, wearing a long robes, but because he wears a hood that is commonly used by travelers, he can't see his face. The man stood outside the shop and was looking at it carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The traveler was a rare thing for the village outside of Ruhr, so Sive Kali immediately came out to greet this person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello, sir, what do you need?" He pointed to the various irons that were already in the shop. "Please pick whatever you want." If you don't have something, I can order it for you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"John!" The man did not answer, after a brief silence, he called out The blacksmith's past name, then he took off his hood from his head, revealing a face similar to the blacksmith. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Brother!" The blacksmith briefly stunned and immediately recognized the identity of the traveler. Joy and excitement filled his face, and he rushed up and hugged his brother tightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Punk looks at the son sitting in front of him, father and son alone In this room, it is relatively silent. In just two or three years, the change of gold is really big. The once calm face is now weather-beaten. I must have experienced too many hardships and difficulties, which makes him look much older than he actually is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dad!" Kim tried to calm his voice. After so long silence, he spoke first. Although he left less than three years, his father’s face was much older than the impression. "I am back! Dad!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Punk stood up, went to the gold, and hugged his son. The father and the son hugged together. When Kim left his hometown with his dream and Leif, when the grocery store owner shouted loudly and claimed that he had to sever the relationship with his son who had left home, the two of them might never have thought of it. I will hold it so tightly when I meet again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You will not leave, gold?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold has been home for three days, in these three days, old punk The matter of "reverse" has spread throughout the village. People are curious to visit the Kali family, mainly to see the child who finally returned home. However, just like other things, after three days, everyone's enthusiasm has subsided, and the topic has also left Kim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dad!" The magician stepped into the store and saw his father under the dim oil lamp, so he released a bright ball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gold?" Punk looked up and looked at the ghost thing that his son had made, but this thing was much better than the poor oil lamp. The eyes that made him slightly presbyistic were more clear, so he didn't say anything, just bowed his head and continued his work. "What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ken... How is he doing now?" The magician asked, although he actually knew the result, but there was still luck. Longing for the possibility of one in ten thousand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Punk slowly raised his head and looked at his son, then he lowered his head again and sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s already dead... It’s a very bad death. I saw it when I was buried and buried... I was almost split in half...” Old Punk He sighed again. "So good young people are really talented in the sky... even the names are not engraved, not even letting people know where they are buried."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "So...Mimi?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She lives in the city now, with a child... The days are not easy. Right, Kim. You should go see her, you three were so good friends!" Old Locke did not look up, so he could not see the gold face pale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...OK, Dad... I will go tomorrow afternoon!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold walks on the streets of the city of Rohr, looking at the streets that have not changed much on both sides. Although it was already a long time ago, when he passed the turn, he remembered that he was intercepted by the magician of the black robe and was taken to the School of Magic in the absence of explanation. in. That accident changed his life. Otherwise, the blacksmith shop is now, he is not his brother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing wrong with this, the military camp is separated by the middle of a street! The magician walked to the very ordinary house and saw the military camp from here. Kim still remembers that he and Ken are starting from here to destroy the bandits, but now, Ken is no longer there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door of the house is closed, the magician wants to knock on the door, but still hesitate. He stood in front of the door until someone pulled his clothes and squatted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Uncle, what are you doing in front of my house?" The little girl asked him with such childish innocence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This girl is about two or three years old and has just reached the age when she can be run to the door by her parents. But it is not her age, but her face that attracts gold. Although the face of this little girl is like a child of all ages, it is round, but the five senses clearly show the combination of the two faces. The magician knelt down and looked at the little girl's face carefully. He looked as carefully as if he was trying to prove something that he was not sure about. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician reached out and gently put it on the little girl's shoulder. "What is your name, little girl?" the magician asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My mother said that I can't just tell my name to a stranger!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No relationship, tell Uncle, uncle is not a bad person!" Kim said softly, but the heart felt a strange look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No... Mom told me I can't say..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing, put Open Mary!" Along with this angry voice, a woman rushed over, she grabbed the child from the gold hand, and then looked at the magician with a very fierce look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold also raised his head, the eyes of the two men came together, and the woman’s eyes slowly began to soften. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gold! You are gold!" She rushed over and grabbed the magician's hand. "It's really you... really... oh, I haven't seen each other for so many years... don't stay outside, come in and sit!" Meimi turned her face to her daughter, "Mary, call Uncle!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Uncle!" The little girl screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold looks at Mimi, she is wearing a very ordinary blue coat on her upper body and a pink skirt on her lower body. But both of these clothes became greasy due to the damage caused by the fumes. Her face has changed a lot from the past, and the innocence in memory has disappeared from her face because of heavy blows and life. But she is still her, and Mi Mi still has not changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you doing, come in and sit down!" Mi Milian pulled and pulled Jin into the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I haven't seen each other for many years! When did you come back? Oh, I forgot, I heard that you are a magician now..." The face is full of the joy of meeting the old man. "Your face can really change a lot, I can't recognize it at first!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s been a lot of years!" Answer, since I went to the School of Magic, I have never seen Meimi! But even after so many years, when I met, I still recognized her at once. "But you don't seem to change at all, just like before!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hahahahaha...you really can talk!"Mimi laughed hard I took a gold shoulder. "I heard that you left home, how have you been in the past few years?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just spent two years as an adventurer..." Kim looked around. The decoration in this house is not very good. "Yes, how are you doing now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Put ordinary, I am doing it now at the quarry Live, cook for the miners!" Meimi replied with a smile. "Although I can barely eat it, but it's OK!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there no pension?" Kim couldn't help but ask, but He immediately regretted it. Because the smile on the face of Mimi solidified. The young woman’s face was calm, but there was extreme sadness in her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't matter...It doesn't matter...It doesn't matter... ..."Mimi showed a smile as much as possible, but the voice looked awkward. "That has passed... It has passed! There is no pension... because Ken is only fighting as a mercenary..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people stand in front of the grave and bow down in silence, this grave is no different from the other graves around. In addition to the familiar name on the tombstone - Ken was buried here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician raised his head and turned his face to see the beautiful rice still immersed in sadness. Her face seemed to be no different from that of the time. A voice that was pressed deep inside suddenly rushed up. It was a hidden will and ** that penetrated the heart at this particular time. Layers of defense, burst out like a volcano. But there is another force that is suppressing it. The two thoughts are violently colliding in the golden heart, and the conflict is more intense than any magical war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meimi looked at Kim, her eyes were so penetrating, and the magician felt a guilty guilty, and could not help but turn his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, Kim!" The sound of the meter sounded, but it seemed so out of reach. "Do not worry, I can support it... The days are not very sad, much better than at the beginning! Everyone is very concerned about supporting me..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; A strong wind blew over and blew the dress of Mi Mi. The magician suddenly found that the Mei Mi at the moment was no different from the girl at that time. The face, the body, the voice, in this second, Kim seems I saw that Mimi’s face was completely filled with innocence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, I have always been willing to go out to work - just like before... I am stupid, gold! Sometimes I even feel knocked The person is willing..." The voice of Mimi is full of happiness, but Kim also hears a warning from it. "With Mary to be with me, I will be alone in the past."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A hammer slammed into the heart of Kim, and then the wound A sorrowful liquid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's go, Mimi. Go back." The magician said. At this time, Kim found that his disguise was as good as it was, so that the voice and the heart were completely isolated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, go back!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people walked out of the cemetery and stood at the door of the cemetery Mary rushed up and Mimi picked it up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mom, why didn't Dad come back?" Little girl suddenly raised this question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Stupid child, Dad has something to go out! Wait a little longer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Daddy, don't you want us?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Stupid... Mary is so cute, who wouldn't want you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, Mimi, I think of some important things, I have to go first!" Kim found He has already reached the critical point of the explosion, he said in a hurry, and then turned around and turned to the opposite direction of Mami's home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just turned a corner, the magician's legs could not support the body. He leaned against the wall and the whole body suddenly lost strength and leaned against the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart is very painful, a worm has drilled in, biting a big mouth. The whole person with Jin Pao bent down and couldn't even straighten. The emptiness and the loss are as sinister as the shadows. It seems that a fragile egg is broken. After the yolk protein in the streamer, there is only one empty shell, which is empty and empty outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is just a bubble that doesn’t have much hope. Gold is shouting loudly at himself. But it didn't work, it didn't alleviate anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden mouth and gasping, leaning against the corner of the wall, it is like a patient with an acute attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are people coming up and talking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician suddenly found himself unable to stand it, he raised the magic ring in his hand, and in a flash, with the twist of space, gold disappeared here. In front of the group of onlookers. He didn't move the space for positioning. This behavior is magical because he doesn't know where he will be sent. But now the magician can't take care of this, he just wants to escape, the farther the better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold looked up and found that he had returned to the secret place of his childhood, he, Mi Mi, Ken, the secret place shared by three people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The setting sun is still throwing the light on this beautiful hillside, the grass is still reflecting the golden sunlight, making the hillside look like outside the green underwear. Put on a gold coat. There is only one person in gold around. He began to run wildly on the grass, shouting insignificantly, venting desperately until he couldn’t run anymore, and then lying on his back on the grass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hehehehehehe..." A familiar and disgusting voice suddenly sounded, and the magician raised his head fiercely, and saw the tall body in a black robe standing on the top of the slope, the sun shining on his body, on the slope Long shadows on the top. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sirweed? What do you want?" Kim stood up and suddenly found himself in his heart without fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing, just want to ask for some compensation!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Compensation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have destroyed two of my beloved dolls. Is it wrong to ask for some compensation?" The voice of the Sayādaw sounded as disgusting as before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then how do you want me to pay?" Jin Leng answered with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s fine to compensate yourself!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Locke walked to Wei. The warrior still wears armor - this has become his habit - but there is a strong alcohol in his body, not knowing how much he has drunk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Is drinking useful?” Old Locke replied with no mercy, “Drinking can kill eight eyes of the devil? In addition to damaging your own body, You can't get anything!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are holding old Locke, his eyes are blood red. Then he turned his head in disregard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want to take revenge?" Old Locke sounded a little lower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How to report? How do I report this body?" Wei put his face together and talked to the old Locke's nose. "There is no way even for the big priests. The damage caused by the artifacts can't be cured! As long as the Eight-Eyed Devil uses a little bit of power, he can step me down again! I am just a clown in his eyes... everything is In vain efforts..." His face left Old Locke and began to whisper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But I have a way to heal your wounds and give you more power!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Really?" Wei looked up and looked at the serious face of Old Locke. Suddenly he broke out with a force and reached for the other's chest. "Really?" he asked again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, but it costs a lot..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not afraid!" Wei suddenly Crazy, "What can I! What else can I lose? I have nothing, nothing! In addition to my body and my armor, I have nothing! What price do I fear?" Just give me the opportunity to revenge, for my loved ones, for Mink, to avenge myself, or just give me a chance to revenge, I can lose anything!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Locke breaks away from Wei, then walks to the corner, picks up the Demon Sword where Wei Lianshe is placed, and then pulls out the sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You look, Wei!" Old Locke stretched out his left hand and then swung his sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arm leaves the body as the sword falls, and the blood spurts out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this?" Wei asked in surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait to see!" Old Locke’s face remained the same, as if there was no pain. The strange thing happened, the blood stopped slowly, at an incredible speed. Such a large wound stops bleeding in a blink of an eye, and then the blood that falls to the ground begins to rise from the ground and back into the body. Then, with Wei's incredible gaze, the broken arm floated from the ground and reconnected to the wound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Less than ten minutes before and after, the old Locke’s hand returned to normal, just as there was no injury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You will become such a monster... Would you like it too?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Yes..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the body of the Phantom Warrior!" Old Locke calmly replied. "My method is to change your body and transform the monster that looks like me! Do you accept it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's amazing!" Kim gasped. There is no chance of victory at all, and the magic and skills of both sides are not at the same level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you not a curse mage? Why don't you try it without a curse!" The sarcasm of the sage came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forbidden? Yes, but the curse is too powerful, and Kim knows that he can't limit the scope of the curse to a small enough range. If you use the curse, the nearby village of Sidlik can't be saved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't need it? Then I used it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What, the sage will also Curse? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demon's spiritual contact made him instantly understand the doubts in the golden heart, and he laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't think that only the world can control the curse! Hehehehe" Laughs laughed. "There is no magic in this world that my family can't manipulate." Strength!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...from the depths of the sky, the great soul that has been imprisoned since ancient times! Tell your anger about the stupid things in this world... "The Sayādaw actually began to swear by the sky, but his spell was not known to Kim. There is no such one in the human curse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Hold death on the head of the fool! Meteor!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sky is more dazzling than the light of the setting sun. The meteorite with fire rushed to the ground, pounced behind the gold, and pounced on the whole area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No! No... No... No!?" Kim looked at this unprecedented scene with an unbelievable look, while muttering to himself Head. But why didn't he believe that the huge meteorite came to the earth, and a huge pillar of smoke shrouded the city of Rohr at the moment. After the smoke had dispersed, the city had been smeared from the ground, leaving only a huge, black smoke pit. Nothing left, no one can escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hehehehehehe...very spectacular scenery..." The voice of the singer sounded, "How, my curse is still in." Is your eye?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician turned his head and his eyes had turned into a blood and fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh But the air seemed to suddenly become a mass of mud, trapping him inside, and simply could not get out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You bastard!" Gold struggled in the trap of the air, and he was crying now. The magic of the Sayādaw is almost beyond the scope of his knowledge. Even the two most powerful magisters on the mainland are defeated by the Supreme Master. What can the great magician in this area sit on? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Use your body to compensate for my loss!" The sage smiled smugly and began to move toward a magician who could not move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A black light suddenly shot, hitting the Supreme from behind, but did not cause any harm to him. The demon turned his head and saw the necromancer flying forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sages did not move at all, but countless holy sages have appeared around him, and then attacked Nobis with rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nubis body suddenly disappeared before these terrible fires came, and after a beautiful close-range space move, he appeared next to Kim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We go, young people!" Nubis grabbed the ring on the golden hand, and then both of them disappeared in the eyes of the sage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let me go!" The magician struggled hard, "I want to kill He...the devil..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You just go to death!" Nobis’s voice did not fluctuate at all, his power was beyond humanity. The struggle of Kim in his hands is like a child, and it is in vain. "The devil wants to make you a phantom warrior, even if you want to escape, you can't escape. He will find you sooner or later!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't you know? I heard about the magic trick of the magic of the power, that is, the magic of the magical statue of the activity. And the phantom warrior is the result of the development of the highest and most evil, made with ** The steerable cockroach! I don't know why he chose you, but in short, you are destined to escape!" Nubis answered calmly. Kim slowly stopped struggling, then he suddenly turned his head and watched Nubis covered with a dark face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You mean...I killed them? All the people in the city are killed by me? Because I went back to my hometown, so I killed They are? Is it?" Kim asked with a cry, his face was full of tears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you must understand from this perspective...Yes, it is because of you that the city was destroyed! Dead you, he intends to make you suffer first...just like he did to Wei in the past."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am...I am...I am harmed Dead her..." Kim whispered in pain. Nubis took off the ring from his hand and put it on his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Leave here first!" The undead sorcerer glanced at the darkened land, and no one could see that it used to be a city. It was really The power of terror. In his memory, the only thing that can cause such complete and complete destruction is the eternal ravage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you brought him back?" When the zombie mage appeared behind him At that time, the old Locke did not return immediately to ask questions. He is writing something with a pen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, respect the teacher!" Nubis replied. "I just arrived. It seems that he didn't lie to us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Best he didn't lie to us!" Old Locke put down his pen and turned his head. Facing the Necromancer. "However, even if this is a trap, we can only step in it, because there is no other choice! Anyway, it is a failure, it is better to gamble! And the sage seems to have no need to make a trap again!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But...only two of them are..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reassure!" Old Locke replied. "With the Demon Sword and that thing... We still have a chance! I can't participate in the battle, and this battle has nothing to do with you... The rest, there are only two young people!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He then sighed. "I didn't think that the energy of the demon was so big. Even if he didn't get the contract of the dragon, he would definitely win... I really can't imagine that he could actually speak the winged and lizard people... if it really happened If there is a chaos in the whole world, no matter whether it is a forest alliance or a high-level goblin, it is absolutely impossible to watch it quietly on the side..." Old Locke looked up at the ceiling. This rudimentary house was originally intended to be a temporary residence for the travellers who passed through the temple. There was no decoration at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A new battle for hegemony is about to begin... and no matter what the outcome, victory can't be ours!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the demon for?" Nubis asked, "What is he for?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Not important, the result is the key!” Old Locke replied softly. "This is the universal standard of humanity - we just got up to fight the powerful high-level goblins for this reason..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold lies in bed, his mind is blank, and his heart is only sad and confused. I once thought that I knew Wei, but now I can feel the feeling that the soldiers have continued for so many years, the mixture of absolute powerlessness and grief and hatred, full of unwillingness and hatred, but reason tells me that this is just futile. This kind of conflict is so painful, even if he thinks he will be killed by the sages there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this inside the temple? It’s ridiculous, why do you think about this question, what is the relationship between not in the temple? Suddenly I realized that I have no home to go back! Nubis may have lied to him, but the Supreme is unwilling to let him go for some reason. The farther away from home, the safer the family is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door sounds, the magician looks at the side, and the person who comes in is the old Locke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thing? What else can I help? I can't even do my own thing... also help people? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I found the lair of the sage, and now it is our turn to take the initiative. I want you to go with Wei! It is dangerous, but..."< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the words can’t be heard, because there is no need to hear it? Want to go with Wei yourself? Going to fight with the Lord? This sounds like a myth, or the boring motto of the knights when they face the inevitable failures. "No victory, only glory." Even after using the trap and depriving the sage of the magical power and mobility, he still gets the result, going to his lair and facing him... it’s ridiculous! Also said danger, is this dangerous? This is called death! Or, as Nubis said, give the Lord the material to make the Phantom Warrior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know that you are very upset, but don't you want to be your teacher, and the innocent residents of the city of Rolle..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teacher...Yes, he died to save me, just to save me this useless apprentice...He is stupid, really. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And Mimi!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last sentence produced terrible lethality, let The magician's entire body bounced off the bed like a spring. He rushed to the front of old Locke and grabbed his clothes. Old Locke's height is similar to him, but at this time, Kim looks like he is half a head taller than Old Locke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you know!" Gold angered, just as all the cowards were stimulated to the most painful position in the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are you? How much do you know? You know what I know, but I don’t know you! You are a wanderer in front of us. Old Locke, in front of the big priest, is the leader of the Adventurers’ Union, Gilles, who became the legendary magician in front of the Eight-Eyed Devil. I don’t know who you are in front of others! You are Who? You know how to master magic, why do you always regret your magic? I don't know why you found me, guide me, use me, but I want to tell you, I am not arbitrarily manipulated by you!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Locke’s face is also red, and a anger seems to rush to the face he has never had. He twisted the gold wrist with amazing strength and pushed the magician's huge body down on the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Holy Light! What a brilliant name!" he shouted. "But this name has ended with the end of that era! Yes, some people have been called this way, but that is not me! Kid, you may understand the pain of immortality? Look at everything that is gone in front of you, all the glory Turning into dust, all the people you love, the people you guard all leave you... You think you lost your lover's experience I don't know? Don't pretend there, the world's poor people are not the only one!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are you?" Kim turned his head, regardless of the wound on his head - the power of Old Locke was so big, let his head lick Hit the wall - ask in a frightened tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am a phantom warrior!" Old Locke said with an indescribable expression, "The human ambition called the Holy Light for his stupidity. The idea of ​​'forever guarding humans', so infuse your soul into the body of the Phantom Warrior, that is me! I have no past, no future, just like the guardian beasts and magic traps that guard the ancient treasures. The illusory ideal! Until I can't take it anymore! I can't use magic anymore, because this body can't bear it - once it's used, it will be dry and decaying!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "But you are different!" Old Locke stepped forward. "You are a real human being, and the future! You are not bound by anything, you are free! Choose yourself, spend your life in pain and self-blame - if that is the case, I will not force you - - Still have to fight for yourself, fight for yourself, for your teacher and lover! Maybe you will fail, but at least you can get rid of it! Choose young people!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I...do you have a chance?" The magician looked up at Old Locke, and there was still a last trace of confusion in his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, but it is costly! Have you seen the magic book?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Look... but can't read..." Gold whispered. In the past, he has been reading the magic book, but it is too complicated. Even the most powerful magicians, those knowledgeable people must digest the book through long-term research and repeated inference. The knowledge of Kim’s current level is still too superficial for this book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kim struggled to stand up, "I am willing!" he shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lev gently knocked on the door, "big priest, it’s me "He said so loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come in!" The voice of the big priest came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leif pushed the door in and saw the big priest sitting in the chair hill, holding a cup in his hand, full of amber liquid. The highest-ranking woman in the temple is drinking wine alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's the matter with you?" She glanced at Lev, who had taken off his therapist's robes - although he wore the clothes for less than a month. - In exchange for his tattered leather armor, and carrying luggage on his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for taking care of this for a long time... I think, I think," Lev said with some urgency, "I should have left..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" The priest laid down the cup in his hand. "Is it because of who? Is there discrimination or deliberately embarrassing you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, no..." Lev quickly explained, "There is no such thing." ...just...just it is not for me!" He looked down and couldn't look at the face of the big priest. "Although life is very good here, but... it is too restrictive," he said in an almost inaudible voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you not like Elna? As long as you become a beginner..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No..." Lev swallowed, "I like her very much, but..." He finally got the courage. "I found that I was used to the adventure life. The life of the temple really made me feel very boring."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big sigh sighed, she reached for the cup in her hand And then said something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, come out, Elna!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee looked surprised In front, the curtain in the middle of the room was pulled open, and the figure of Elna appeared behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, I..." Lev said nothing yet When it was finished, it was interrupted by the big priest wave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't expect you two to come to me to say the same thing, I still want to force you to stay. It's not too boring... but you have to agree to my conditions." "She turned her head and looked at Lev. The expression seemed to be full of murderousness, and the scared thief took a step back." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have to bring Elna!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mom!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Da Siji made a gesture to stop the red-faced Erna, and continued to say "and you must take good care of her, can't make her sad!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leif lingered for a long time, then he finally reacted. He looked at Elna, who was also flushed in front of him, and smiled embarrassedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where are you going now?" Erna asked in the back The front of Lev. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go to the magician first!" Lev replied. "First find him, then we can regroup a team... I wanted to go to the Northwest Forest Alliance a long time ago!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know Where is Kim?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He must go home!" Lev answered confidently. "I know where his hometown is. But the fall of Wei." I don't know," Lev's tone changed. "He suddenly disappeared from the temple. There should be nothing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is very strong, There won't be anything!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lev walked into the front hall, and suddenly he saw a familiar back in front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lev’s words were interrupted because the man turned around. The gray hair and the wrinkled face proved that the thief had mistaken the person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, sir... I admit the wrong person..." Lev was embarrassed to take a step back and apologize. Although I was shocked, fortunately this person did not seem to be angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter..." The old magician turned his face again and seemed to appreciate the relief on the wall. A therapist came over at this time. "Do you have anything, sir?" he asked the magician who looked different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I just came here... look at the temple..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Sorry, if you don't have anything, please don't stay here, here is the wounded!" The therapist made a courtesy order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah... sorry!" The old magician ate this soft nail and had to turn and walk toward the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s weird! I must have made a mistake!" Lev watched the old man disappear into the doorway. "The old man not only has an image but even walks." It’s almost like gold!” He shook his head and decided not to think about this stupid question. It’s important to think about ways to get back your gear. I don't know if those guards will give him the weapons to oil at a fixed time...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The old magician walked down the steps and stopped in front of the statue of the lady in front of the temple, silently watching this gorgeous statue, for a while did not move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Forty years..." He whispered to himself that the lightness of the light could not be heard by others. "The God of Chaos took away my forty years as a price... Now even Lev doesn't know me...so, I am already dead!<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the magical array that connects to the lord's nest. "Old Locke put the paper in front of the gold. Kim then draws a magical array on the ground, and then slowly feels the composition and rules of the energy in this magic array.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"I understand. He opened his eyes and looked at the old Locke in front of him. "I will hold it!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have to remember what you want to do!" Seal the magic of the other party. Don't try to beat the sage with magic, no one can beat the demon with magic! The last time the trap was used only once, there was no second chance. Old Locke said slowly to Kim, the latter nodded. "The only thing that can kill the demon is the Demon Sword. Your mission is to cooperate with Wei." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician turned around silently. His spirit is completely different from before, although it is only half a month, but gold and the real four Ten years ago. What he got is definitely not available in 40 years. In fact, he has not even fully absorbed the knowledge that is integrated into his memory. So huge knowledge and power is not one person can be in half a month. The whole body is fully integrated.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold turned to face Wei. The warrior was wearing the armor and carrying a sword in his hand. His face was wearing gold and the first time. The mask that met for a while - Wei kept the fragments of the mask around, and now the mask was repaired by Nubis. Although he could not see the expression on his face, Kim could still feel the power of Wei. He is vaguely aware that there have been some changes in Wei's body, although it is not certain exactly where it changed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go! Wei just said this with his eyes, but now the gold can be read very clearly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician walks to Wei, with his wand in the air Draw a symbol and then the two disappear.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you say they can succeed? teacher? "The body of Nubis suddenly appeared in the side of the old Locke after the disappearance of Kim and Wei.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe, maybe not..." Old Locke looked at the Necromancer The face, "Some things can't be grasped by anyone. When I developed the Undead Magic, who would know that one day the Necromancer would have a desperate battle with humans? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people appeared in this mysterious cave. The old Locke’s message was correct. With the help of the magical array, Kim easily sent two people to the saint’s lair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This rock cave is large and long, but it has not been decorated and refurbished, basically maintaining its original appearance. If there is no magical array when they come in, there is nothing to prove that this is the devil's nest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are moving forward, two people are all guarded, maybe because of tension, both of them feel the special atmosphere that is emanating here, as if there is a trap waiting Swallow these two humans who are not self-reliant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Welcome to the two!" A voice suddenly came, and both people were shocked. The Sayādaw appeared in front. Just now he completely concealed his own breath. If it was not suddenly, the two would definitely regard him as a tall stalagmite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you know that we are coming?" The magician asked, he had recovered from the shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Look at the fact that you can come here, I tell you the truth!" The Sayādaw slowly came to this side, "Honely Say, I saw that when you two appeared, my surprise was not much less than your surprise.” He smiled, and the frog sound inside the box echoed in the rock cave. "I know that the Light will definitely come to me and find a way to get rid of me, so I have been waiting here - just that I didn't think it was two of you."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why!" Kim continued to ask, while carefully observing the surrounding environment, they are not familiar with this place, the longer the delay, the better for them. Wei also understands this, so he has been patient, and Kim can even see the hand of the warrior holding the sword shaking slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because he had to do this! Hehehehehehe..." The Sayādaw gave a shrill smile. "I think he has got the news. The half-orc and the dwarf coalition are brewing a larger offensive. This time Dico is in jeopardy... The lizard people are already eager to try because I taught them how to expand the swamp. Let them first have the desire to expand their territories for thousands of years. Also, "The Sayādaw said in that ironic tone. "The tribal alliance of the Winged People has agreed that once human beings are in chaos, they immediately fight against humanity. They have suppressed their desire for wealth for too long. If they are given a chance, they will immediately mobilize. Once mobilized, "The tone of the Sayādaw is getting more and more proud. "Then they will never wait too long - whether or not human beings are in chaos. The last new race in the mainland will begin, and no race can stay out of it, including High Fairy, including the Forest Alliance... It was originally human beings who separated the races. Now, this barrier is about to be broken! Hehehehehehe..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I laughed again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And the light of the human guardian's own light, his head can only think of using my way to stop it! It's a pity, I let this Everything can be developed without my intervention... Even if you can get rid of me, it won't end!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not trying to be old Locke or human, I am fighting for myself!" Kim whispered, both of them carefully confirmed, and the Sayādaw did not lay any traps. The two people have a tacit understanding and slowly separated, forming a pre-week, and relying on the preparation of the attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stupid, I don't know if I use it!" The sages answered without hesitation. The irony in the tone is very strong. "But you just want to win." I?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't try to see how to know... I want to ask you once, why are you doing this? Why? What are the races for you? Benefits?" In an instant, the magician grasped the spiritual tentacles that the sages spy on his heart. Immediately, the two had a spiritual battle! Kim didn't know how to let the other person know how much he was, but he knew the purpose of everything that the Sayādaw did. He is not specifically aimed at humans, just because human beings are right in the center of the continent and become a natural barrier separating all races. Therefore, he must deal with human beings first. Otherwise, the war will not be able to fight. Unfortunately, there are so many races that can be used by the Sayādaw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a short battle, the Devil regained his spiritual tentacles. He couldn't help but make a surprised voice. The two enemies suddenly changed so that he couldn't see through it! One heart has an insurmountable defensive wall, and the other directly captures the spiritual extension of his spying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why? Good question! The life that has just been born will take the initiative to find the mother's **, and the rattlesnake will bite all the legs and legs that are approaching, even if those feet do not step on it. Does this need a reason? Need! And I hope to see that this continent is not so dead, it should be a bit more lively."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really?" The magician asked coldly. In the spiritual battle just now, he penetrated a little deep into the heart of the Sayādaw through the tentacles. There, he did not get the same answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sage did not pay attention to the gold, continue to say it, he did not seem to notice that Wei is getting closer to him. Now the distance between the devil and the gold is twice the distance from Wei. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have been successful for a long time, but I still made some mistakes. The first thing is that you have disturbed my important experiment!" Let the latter stop for a while, "I made a helping World of Warcraft to protect myself, I want to safely complete the experiment of the highly magical Phantom Warrior! But it was disturbed by you. For your sake, I only made one though Power, but no fighting skills and proper judgment of waste! I spent four hundred years preparing for this experiment, but it was destroyed by you all at once... I won't let you go easily! You must do this Atonement!... Also, when I sent Warcraft from the Dark Continent to the Orcs to enhance their strength, there was a loophole in the magic, and a large number of Warcraft were transmitted to various places in the mainland... causing attention that could have been avoided. ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Up!" Kim shouted, and then a thunderbolt immediately threw himself out of his hand and shot at the Sayādaw. "Electric shock magic thunder!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stupid!" Immediately around the body of the Sayādaw, a round defensive wall was created, and the lightning strikes the defensive wall, which is surprising. Yes, the magic of gold actually broke the defense of the devil and hit him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this magic has hardly exerted any lethal consequences, but has reached the goal of containment, Wei has crossed the space between him and His Holiness. Destroy the sword and slash it. His speed is completely beyond the expectations of the demon, and he can't make any resistance, so Wei is getting close to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a light ball in the demon's hand, but Wei has already rushed to him. Their combined attack is beyond the expectations of the enemy, especially the speed of Wei, so that the Sayādaw was caught off guard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sword was cut and the hand of the devil was being cut. The sword was so heavy that a blue arm was immediately cut down and landed on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei didn’t stop, before the sword was lifted again, the violent spurt came out, and the black cloak on the demon was torn into countless flying blacks. butterfly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Abominable!" The devil screamed, and he didn't know what was going on. Just now Wei Juran was unaffected, and this was enough to inspire the damage caused by the Hammer of the God of War. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Strengthen!" Kim promptly added to him at the end of Wei. Wei once again spurred, this time aimed at the eyes of the left chest of the Sayādaw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sword penetrated into the eye and pulled out a blood arrow. But the effect of this sudden blow ended here. At the third attack, the Sayādaw was out of the sword. Wei's speed is indeed beyond humans, but the Sayādaw is not much worse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil made a reaction beyond the unexpected of two people, and he turned and fled to the other side of the cave. Wei immediately followed up, and Kim took a moment to follow up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This chase is a magical battle. The devil is constantly using paralysis, sluggishness, freezing, quicksand, space constraints, atmospheric traps, etc. Magic attacks the Wei behind him, while Kim is doing the opposite, constantly cursing. Although Kim lost 40 years of years in exchange for the power of this great magician, but compared with the respected, his magic speed is obviously inferior, only to see the move, Wei is to keep the fight is not wasted, three figures Keeping chasing for a long time under this delicate balance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil suddenly stopped and turned to look at the two people behind. In this short process, his arm that was cut off by Wei has been completely regenerated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the devil stopped, the two stopped. Gold is in front and Wei is behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hehehehe..." Sayādaw suddenly laughed. "I have to admit that you are doing very well, but the game is over!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised his hands With a weird pronunciation, Kim sees light spots appearing around him. Magic text appears in every corner of the rock wall. Kim looks at the words and suddenly recognizes what these are. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a magical array! The Sayādaw actually used this thing first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold knows that it is useless. With these things in place, no magic can be used. The elves are in a chaotic and chaotic environment in this space, and they are unable to exert their power at all. A magic that could have blown up a mountain is now barely able to light a piece of paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the sage can't use magic anymore! And they have Wei on this side. If Wei and Sage begin to fight hand-to-hand, the magician knows that the warrior will become the winner. His Holiness relied mainly on his immortal body in the close combat, but once he was cut by the sword, he still needs time to regenerate. And as long as Wei beat him down, then he will never have a chance to be born again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wei, look at you...ah..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blonde screams The demon sword was cut from his left shoulder and almost cut off half a shoulder. He turned his head. Wei behind the mask was a pair of irrational eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hehehehehehe..." The sorcerer laughed. The magician fell softly, and the blood spurted out of his terrible wound and sprinkled the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is death? Very quiet and peaceful, the body seems to have been melted by this calm feeling, slowly, lost its sense of existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A river appeared in front of it, the sun shines on the bank of the river, and the flowers across the river are everywhere, it is a beautiful scenery. The magician turned his head and looked behind him. There was a thick fog behind him, and he could feel the roar of the beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold ran forward and ran to the river. After crossing the river, it is a beautiful land. The river is very shallow and it is easy to pass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't come over, gold!" A voice appeared, and the magician looked at the source of the sound and saw Shuke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher!" Kim stepped forward, but his teacher immediately shouted, "Don't come over, go back!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go back?" Gold looked back, the fog behind it was thicker, and the beasts hiding in the thick fog were getting closer. "But..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't come over! Kim, go back!" Another voice came, Raymond didn't know when it happened to be around, but he Say the same words as the repair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..." Kim hesitated and glanced behind him, and the beast would appear at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't come over, go back!" One after another appeared, Behan, Mi Mi, Ken, Wolf, but they said the same thing. "Don't come over, go back..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden opened his eyes, the wound hurts , probably the entire shoulder has fallen off. He barely raised his head and saw that the demon king was standing in the middle, Wei was dancing the sword in a crazy air, and attacked all directions with anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Imaginary!" Kim understands why. The elements of the sacred spirits attacked the magic, completely using the dark magic with the powerful illusion to attack the Wei mentally. Just now Wei slashed himself in the illusion, and then continued to fight against the non-existing enemies. The two of them looked almost like Like a clown who is not self-sufficient. The difference between the enchanted enchantment and the gold is only used to seal the elemental magic without affecting the spiritual magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We suddenly stopped and looked around. He was finally freed from the illusion, but this is deliberate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your ** is perfect!" The sages approached Wei, the warrior's physical strength is still good, but the vindictiveness must have been exhausted in the illusion. "No matter the speed, the strength is very strong, but your spirit is not strong enough. This is the reason for your failure! Your companion is powerful, but his **... is just a sword. Fallen! Hahahaha and you cut it yourself..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? Your body is actually a phantom warrior... hahahaha - really an unexpected income... well, I completely destroy your spirit, and then you are mine!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wei..." Kim wants to talk, but he can't say it, he can only watch Wei suffer from spiritual torture. Wei desperately resisted, but he could not resist the overwhelming will of His Holiness. His memory and reason are being erased a little bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you failing like this? No, never! The soldiers tried their best to support another wave of fierce thoughts, and he looked at the gold that fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden’s eyes are looking at him, and the two are in pairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Listen, Kim!" The soldiers did their best to throw their thoughts into the magician with their eyes. "I have tried my best... no more regrets, but you still have a chance..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know!" The magician also answered with his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After another attack, the Sayādaw also went all out to vow to defeat the opponent's consciousness. Wei suddenly gave up resistance and he fell to the ground. The eyes behind the masks are still facing the magician, but they are just the eyes of the godless. His will was destroyed. Now he is alive, but his body is alive, and the real Wei is dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only one chance must be attacked...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But where is the key? correct! On that day, the sage was destroyed by the curse and the jewel-like crystal that floated in the air. That should be the core of the devil that Old Locke said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the weakness, but where is the crystal hidden in the body? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cruel picture reappeared, a cyan scale hand was formed, and a death light was emitted from the hand, breaking Behan’s sword of the earth After penetrating his body...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the shoulder! That crystal is hidden in the shoulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician closes his eyes and everything is under this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sage came over, he walked to the side of Wei's body and reached for the sword, this is the only weapon in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opportunity! In an instant, Wei’s body jumped up, and the long sword pierced the right shoulder of the Supreme when the Lord’s dreams were not thought of! When the blade pierced a third, it couldn't get in, and it obviously hit the core. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah..." The Devil’s body paused, and the core was hit more than the other parts of the body. The Devil actually changed. Resistance, let Wei again stab the second. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No! Kim felt a pain. He knew that this was the limit of his strength. Physical injuries inevitably affected his spirit. He couldn’t control this phantom warrior for too long, and must hurry! Wei’s long sword flashed like a wind, and a sword and a sword fell to the body of the Supreme, and soon he cut his body into pieces and completely removed the flesh and blood from the core. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A violent dizziness rushed to the brain of gold, which is a sign of excessive bleeding. After the faint feeling passed, he looked over there and looked at the body of the demon, and Wei’s body was standing there. The demon sword is full of the blood of the sage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it victorious?" he said softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Almost a little!" The voice of the Sayādaw came. His head has no idea when it is combined with the core, although the other parts have not re-growth, but it is obvious that he can't die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Repent, it’s the last bit of it... Ah! You..." The smile of the Sayādaw turned into a voice with fear, because the magician The broken body has stood up from the pool of blood and is coming step by step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't fall down... can't fall!" Kim never knew that walking was so difficult, and every step of the effort was to work hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This step is for the teacher... This step is for Mr. Raymond..." Jin Xinzhong slowly told himself that this foot is not for himself. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This step is for Wei..." It has already reached Wei's side. Kim stretched out his right hand and wanted to get the sword, but he almost fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is for Mary..." The magician exhaled a sigh of relief, then grabbed a heavy sword of demon. He was not trained in any sword holding, and his movements were extremely poor, but this did not affect his aiming the sword at the head of the demon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is for the USmi!" Kim didn't use force, because he had no strength at all, he just stabbed it with the weight of the sword itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hahahaha..." The devil's laughter rang again, even though he had one head left. The wound wounded by the Demon Sword is harder to recover than the ordinary wound. Just this sword stabbed his face, but it could not stop the devil's smile. "It turns out that it is like this, it can't kill me! Hahahaha... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is for all who are killed by you!" Gold said softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician began to use magic and used madness once and for all. The gap left by the Lord's enchantment is now being used by his enemies. The hatred in the heart is getting stronger and stronger with the magic. I have long lost my mind, but there seems to be another force in my heart that allows the magician to continue to apply madness to himself under this crazy hate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demon sword began to shake, the sword began to respond to the inner hatred of the holder, the hatred became more and more intense, and the sword shook more and more . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No...Impossible...I can't fail..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One voice Suddenly passed to the heart of Kim, that is the seal of the demon sword. The magician did not resist and spoke out the voice loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Call out the ancient power in the chaos of the outer world, open the door to this time and space for me... from the alien world, listen to me Prayer, I use my blood, my soul, I force to exchange... to end the destruction of all things..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Demon Sword begins to decompose, along with this spell, The entire Demon Sword quickly decomposes, forming a black mist. This is the real secret of the Demon Sword. There are only three demons, they have no fertility, they can't be killed, nothing can destroy him. In this world, the demon king is immortal. Therefore, the real power of the demon sword created by the high leprechaun is the space that belongs to the world in this world. In this space, the law of the world does not work. Can be completely destroyed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A translucent darkness erupted from the Demon Sword, and it shrouded a large space around it. The blade of the Demon Sword became a long mist, and the gold pointed the fog at the head of the Savior. The head of the Sayādaw did not change, but Kim knew that the core had begun to dissolve. I don't know why, just know, it feels the same as visual hearing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No...no..." The demon screamed awkwardly, but he couldn’t shake the gold. He kept this position unchanged and clearly felt that the core had been dissolved. At least half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the fog disappeared and the whole darkness disappeared, leaving only the hilt in the golden hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil stopped the wail, and both of them couldn’t believe it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hahahaha!" The devil laughed and he knew why. The victory is now his. "This sword and the hammer of the god of war have collided... hahahaha... its power has been weakened by that artifact, unable to kill me..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are so lucky! Lord!" A voice came, Kim now has no strength to turn around and see, but he heard the owner of this voice, is cloth special! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are just right, Brett, kill this guy!" Resident shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing, Brett?" The voice passed to the ear, and the pain caused by the fall just kept the lucidity of Kim for the last time. "Ah..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing, just want to see how much your core has melted... ah, almost melted!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you want to betray me?Bright..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Betrayal? Can't talk about betrayal Don't you kill my sister Mink by cruel means? Don't you betray me?... Now this core is really soft, just a little bit of power, you can continue to melt it..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop! I want to help you unlock the seal and give you more power? You are now..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, that's just using each other! You didn't do a lot of things with me? Lord, you really look down on me, don't you know why they came here because I Tell them! Hahahahaha... I also gave them the memory crystal... I don’t know, that memory crystal tells me too many secrets! For example What is the memory crystal? They are the remnants of the devil's core! Just like the one I have now!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I got your crystal! Now all your knowledge and strength are in my hands. As for the sages, you will disappear forever!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this. The final scream of the devil was introduced into the magician's ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician exhaled the last breath, and with this breath, his consciousness is over! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright put this new memory crystal in his hand and concentrated his consciousness on this crystal. Along with this move, many new things flowed into his mind. The memory of the Sayādaw is almost complete, not only the knowledge of magic, but also the memory of the Sayādaw, and of course the stronger power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hahahaha..." Brett laughed again and laughed very well. He turned and looked at the two humans under his feet. Although the appearance changes so much, he still knows that this magician is gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Or I won!" He laughed, everything was his. Everything and everything that His Holiness has done is his. He looked at Kim, and his eyes closed, and it looked like he was dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, Kim! Although I have always hated it, I hate you, but now I really appreciate you... you are really good. ... although I know that you are dead, but in order to thank you, I will send you a ride."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright sent some kind of just knowing The signal, the surrounding magic array disappeared. He proudly reached out a hand, a green acid ball appeared in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Farewell to gold, I will always miss you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop!" With this sound, an electric light passes through the cave and rushes straight toward Brett. Although it did not hit, it has already interrupted the magic in the hands of Brett. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Locke and the Necromancer appear in the vision of Brett. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Necromancer!" Brett suddenly felt a horror, and Wolf's horror was still fresh in his memory. He saw a sorcerer and he felt a cold back. What he wants to get has already been obtained, which makes his heart retreat. Things are slowly coming, first get the knowledge and strength of the Sayādaw and then deal with these two guys. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Locke strode over, but they were too far apart to stop Brett from using space magic to escape. He ran to where two people were lying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gold!" He yelled, but the magician did not move, his wounds were terrible, and it was obviously impossible to save. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wei!" Wei also did not respond. There was no scar on him - it didn't matter if he was injured - but when he turned his face over, Old Locke knew what was going on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do we do? Respect the teacher?" Nubis asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
