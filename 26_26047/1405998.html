The half-orcs who died in their hands (of course, mainly Wei) have no fewer than 30. In addition to the battles that took place outside, there are only more than 30 orcs that can threaten them now. One third of the. Although the situation seems to be great, the adventurers are not good enough to go there now. The wounds in Wei's lungs are not competing. Now every breath is a painful torment, and the lower abdomen hurts a little, but this inappropriate movement also makes it start to send out painful signals. And that impact made Kim's left hand lose his ability to move, and now his left hand swollen handle is full. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he was breathing, Kim suddenly thought of a thought, a thought that could save lives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wei! Hurry up, your sword... my handcuffs..." Although Kim is a bit of a brain in this case, Wei immediately I know the meaning of the magician. The gold hand was placed on the ground, and Wei used all his strength to cut the sword to the center of the handcuffs. With a bang, Mars shot, a big gap appeared on the sword, but the handcuffs did not move, as if laughing at the two humans who are not self-sufficient. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei quickly gasped, the sword just made him a lot of effort, the pain in the abdomen is now a lot more, but he did not care about this, he Raised the sword again. But the magician has already seen that this handcuff is protected by a special force. He knows that it is useless to cut it down, so he stopped the warrior. They must save every effort to cope with the next wave of attacks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people stand together, on the surface are standing together, in fact, Wei relies on Kim, at this moment, Kim knows that his companion has already Unable to fight, the sword just consumed his last strength (but for the sake of gold, Wei still raised the sword again). In fact, if it is not in such an environment, they (including gold) have already fallen on the ground. No more. But now it is impossible to rest, they are waiting for the next attack of the half-orc. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the pain of the whole body, at this time, Wei felt that his mind was particularly clear. He knew that his sword had already reached the previous battle. A height reached. Although a swordsman must have ample physical strength, it is precisely because of extraordinary physical strength that Wei has no way to eliminate the extra movements in his swordsmanship. It’s ironic to say it, when the whole body is hurt and exhausted. Wei Cai really did what he had never done. But this is too late. Anyway, Wei also knows that he will not see the sun of tomorrow. Now kill one more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-beasts seem to have coordinated a bit, and Kim sees them and decides to stop fighting internally before killing themselves and Wei. So now, for the two adventurers, the number of enemies is small, but they are even more dangerous now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-orcs in the audience are waiting for the upcoming fierce battle with nervousness. Lengele is also watching the field carefully. He has come to the conclusion that if two humans want to live, they must sacrifice one and use a human head to cause the half-orcs to kill each other. Otherwise, they both To die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold picks up a half-orc sword with his right hand (his left hand is no longer available), which is almost the first time he became a magician Picking up the sword at a time, although very clumsy, but at the moment more than one sword can give Wei a little help. The two exchanged a look with each other, and Wei immediately knew what Kim was going to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four orcs are arranged in a loose single column to cross the gap in the ring of fire, when Kim is in contact with Wei in the first half of the orcs Threw a sword at him. The sword swung and flew past, and the first half of the orc had to use a weapon to stop the grid - just at the moment of the block, Wei was not so bright and straight with his sword on his neck. A bloody corpse fell immediately into the sea of ​​fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the Orcs still rushed over, they saw that Wei’s sword only attacked their neck, so they all strengthened the defense of this place. The next half of the orcs desperately waved the warhammer, forcing Wei to retreat several steps. Wei finally found a gap, letting his neck spurt a bunch of blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But because of these two steps, the remaining two orcs have already crossed the narrow gap, and now they immediately besieged Wei. If Wei at this moment is in a slightly better condition, then these two orcs will definitely not be able to benefit, but he has not even had the capital to collide with enemy weapons. Under the attack of a sword and a spear, Wei Festival Back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Orcs continue to maintain this unity, then the two adventurers actually don't have much to sing, they can only choose between early death and late death. However, because the soldiers who used to be the same army, some of the half-orcs know each other, they also know each other's strengths and weaknesses. Those who know that the weak are not opponents, if they want to win in the future competition, the only chance is to launch a sneak attack when you don't pay attention, and get rid of those stronger. There was nothing wrong with this idea, but when it was done, the fragile alliance between the orcs would soon be broken down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, the two adventurers looked at the half-orc outside, and once again fell into disarray, Wei suddenly understood, now is his own opportunity If you wait until the half-orc tears to end and unite again, even if they only have ten left, he can't deal with it (just four of them are difficult to deal with), now only rush out, take this opportunity to destroy them. . He looked at the gold with his eyes, and the magician immediately understood the meaning of the warrior. Although dangerous, it was better than waiting for the enemy to attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with the unity of the half-orcs, the two adventurers can really be the same, the gold attracts the enemy’s attention, and Wei is behind the scenes. This very primitive but effective tactic has been maximized. When the fire circle finally got together, there were only two adventurers who were injured in the arena. As a bait, Kim did not have a knife, but fortunately it was not a fatal injury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without any sound, the entire audience was silent, and all the orcs were killed, and this war god sacrifice would not be completed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the two adventurers were sitting on the corpse, a half-orc jumped out of the audience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, human! I didn't think you were so powerful! I am giving you a chance now, I want to have a fair fight with you. If you can overcome me, Then you can get free and safe to go back! Otherwise, your head will be placed on that altar!" Geller speaks in a arrogant tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the King of the Tooth to personally participate in the fight, all the Orcs stood up and they made a thunderous cheer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Geller’s fairness is actually unfair, because his injury on the shoulder is good now, the whole person is in the best state, and two The adventurer has just experienced a hard battle, his body is hurt, and he is exhausted. His so-called fairness is actually fair to himself and extremely disadvantageous to adventurers. But can two people at the moment have a second choice? In any case, they have to fight, after all, this is the only way to live. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greek is now slowly looking at the human beings in front of him, this human eye gives him a feeling of deja vu. Suddenly, Geller remembered where he had seen the eyes, which was under Hope City, and the eyes shot the rifle into his shoulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei stood in front of Geller, his sword was drooping, and the blood on the sword was still dripping. He only said one sentence - he used sign language, Kim translated - "Give me my sword back!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; even Wei also knows if there is no one If you have a good weapon, he doesn't want to live under the hammer of the god of war. He had already seen the terrible power of the hammer under Hope City, and turned the huge ice snake into broken ice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greg shortly said a few words to a subordinate, listened to the command of the king of the tooth, the Orc soldiers quickly handed the sword to Wei’s hand. on. During this time, Göller and Wei have been looking at each other. Although Kim is watching at the side, Gloria has ignored him. In his eyes, his opponent actually has only this warrior. He has a very deep impression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei’s mind is working desperately, and at this moment, he is forcing himself to think of the scene he is most reluctant to think of. I want to defeat this warrior in front of me (although I don't know his identity, but he must be a very important half-orc), Wei only relies on the power of the Berserker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 02<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a warrior, Wei can clearly see it in front of him. This half-orc is definitely not an ordinary thing - not a status, but a strength - just as the same beast can judge whether the animal in front of him is another beast. Originally, when he was in this dungeon, he had already guessed his fate. Therefore, in the previous battle, he fought with mortal determination. He also knew that no matter how successful he was, he could not escape. One death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personally, Wei is rather willing to die than to recall the painful memory. He would rather die like a warrior, but now he has a companion who lives and dies with him. He can’t avoid the sorrow of the magician. Eyes. For gold, he must remember to use that pain to become a Berserker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pain mixed with hatred is constantly drawn from the abyss of memory, Wei briefly closes his eyes, when the eyes open again, the eyes have It’s completely different from the one just now. It’s two people. The clear, sane eyes are full of hatred and madness at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-orc in the audience stopped the cry of the king of teeth, and the murderousness that flowed out of this human being made every half-orc feel cold. The slower half-orc can also see that in front of the King of the Tooth is a beast that is more dangerous than usual because of the injury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregor at this moment felt very uncomfortable - not because he was uncomfortable with the murderous fear, but rather uncomfortable with the murder itself. After feeling the murderousness of Wei, he connected the human being with the human warrior around him. Now he feels that these two human beings are really like, similar body, similar skin color, even face length is similar to six or seven points, but the closest is the same violent kind that two people exude Murderous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are still some differences. Geller holds the hammer of the god of war and thinks that the murderousness of the human beings in front of him is full of cold, bitter hatred. And the murderousness of the warrior exudes the kind of beast that kills the prey. Prior to this, Geller wanted to fight with Wei just because of the simple desire to fight with the strong, but now, fighting this human has a new meaning, because Geller has put Wei and that in his heart. The warrior is equal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei’s murderousness is more intense, and it is so strong that almost any enemy can be frightened and stunned – with the exception of the King of Teeth, which is blessed by God of War. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost at the same time, both Greer and Wei moved, and two weapons made a loud crash in the air, the first hit, each other In the test of the opponent's strength, Wei and Greer want to use force to overwhelm the opponent, but at the moment the two men's arms are not in the same position. Wei relies on the potential of life that is inspired, and Göhler can gain power directly from the hammer of the god of war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After determining that they could not overwhelm their opponents in power, both fighters took the initiative to step back and look at the opponents in front. But this gave Wei a chance, although the power did not fade, but Wei's mind has begun to gradually wake up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time is Wei’s active attack. Since the power is equal, it depends on technology to win the game. Wei Gaochao’s swordsmanship is retreating, and his mind has regained his sensibility. Wei has completely played the skill of the other half-orcs, although Wei’s slow and slow swordsmanship is fierce, but Geller also Absolutely not a fuel-efficient lamp, although he is temporarily on the defensive, but he is still comfortable, after all, he is not an ordinary half-orc warrior - the king of teeth of course has the capital of becoming the king of teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The frequency of the battle is getting faster and faster, and the gold on the fast side has no way to see the movement of the weapon. Now there is only the blade left in the entire arena. Collision sound, all the onlookers are silently watching this evenly contested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two battle figures are separated, this wave of contest is still not winning, but it can be seen that in terms of skills, Wei has the upper hand. Wei looked at the demon sword in his hand. This sword really contains incredible power. In the contest with the hammer of the god of war (We only know that it is a treasure, but did not think it is the hammer of the god of war), it does not Subject to any damage. From this point of view, it is indeed not a human product, no matter what magic sword can not compete with the artifact. Geller did not look at his weapons, because he believed his weapons as he believed in his hands and feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The King of Tooth actively attacks, at the moment of contact, both opponents read their own thoughts from the other's eyes. Both bodies have violent vindictiveness. This time the King of Tooth was attacked to cover up his true offensive, and Wei just wanted to end the battle with vindictiveness. Still not winning, the two vindictives only caused two half-overlapped pits on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician was blown on the ground by this unexpected attack, because the handcuffs that locked his hands, so he could not climb for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why not?" Wei looked at the power of his own vindictiveness. At this moment, he discovered that even if he was mad, the power was not much better than normal. After all, his body is now weak, no matter how excited, the power is very weak after all, this time the power of vindictive power is almost the same as the power of his ordinary state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next contact with the weapon made Wei know that he was not right. He didn't know if his strength was in recession or the other's strength was increasing. His hand was actually numb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now it’s Greg stepping and Wei’s retreat. After the contact, Wei knows that he can’t collide with the other’s weapon again. If you do, then the sword will fly out of your own hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, there is only one way!" Wei said to himself, he knows that he actually can't support it for a long time, he doesn't know what he will be. When the whole body is pulled off, it falls to the ground. The last time I was in the city of Hope in the city of Hope, it was such a sudden sudden loss of the whole person. Although it took a bit of a risk, it was only when I was able to move now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei Lianlian stepped back a few steps away from the scope of Geller’s attack and re-opened the posture. His eye had already seen a nearby corpse, and a scorpion had a sword in his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Geller is still stepping forward, he knows that the victory is already beckoning himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei suddenly slammed and threw the Demon Sword to Geller when he reached the corpse. Pulling up the sword while shooting down the long sword (in fact, one hand is still pulling out with one other hand). The sword on the body stabbed the tip of the sword to the unsuspecting throat. Geller’s warhammer has not recovered because of the flying sword, so there is no way to protect himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plan went very smoothly. Geller used the force to open the flying sword, so now the empty door is wide open and the sword is sent straight, although the king of teeth has lowered his chin to protect the throat. But it is as deadly as it is on the chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he stabbed his chest - Wei certainly aimed at the heart - Wei found his mistake. He learned this skill called "double knife and kill" from his own teacher. In the one-on-one battle, this is a terrible killing. But usually, the user's second knife is pulled out of his body. Now, Wei has no second sword on his body, so he unplugs the second sword from the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a broken sword, although he may still be a good sword when he penetrates into the body, but at the moment Wei pulled out but there is no The tip of the sword. The long sword did not have the chest that was able to penetrate Gray's leather armor. It may have caused damage to Göhler, but it was only a negligible injury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Geller stepped back half a step, he has not yet awake from this sudden attack of Wei, he is only instinctively waving the hammer of the god of war to Wei. Wei Shoujian blocked the block, but the hand in his hand was not the sword of the demon. Under the attack of the hammer of the god of war, this common sword of the half-orc soldiers became a piece of steel. The Warhammer immediately launched a second attack, and only Wei, who had a hilt in his hand, could only jump. He rushed to the place where the Demon Sword is now, and he must regain the Demon Sword, otherwise he will lose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But his opponent won't let him get the sword again, the third hammer hits the right shoulder blade on the back (the shoulder blade is completely broken) Wei's The whole body fell down. Some kind of power has invaded his body, liberating him from the state of the mad warrior who does not know the pain. From the fall of the ground, Wei actually can't stand up, let alone continue to fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three strikes are completely reflective movements that have been developed over many years of combat. Geller knew that the danger had passed when his opponent fell. Recalling the thrill of the moment, he couldn’t help but sweat on his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But in any case, Geller is still victorious, and the huge shouts from around are the greatest affirmation of his victory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 03<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We lie on the ground that is already full of blood, at this moment He has already drained his last strength, and he can only watch Geller slowly approach himself and not even move a finger. There is no way to take into account the enormous pains that have been uploaded from the shoulders. He just feels desperate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you here?" Wei said to himself. At this moment, his heart is not only desperate, but also annoyed. If you don't get the broken sword, if you are in a state of full prosperity now, if you haven't experienced that hardship... If you don't have any of the ones, then it's the one that is waiting on the ground for the end of the day. Half-orc. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Human, you listen," Geller said in a standard general language to Wei, who fell to the ground. "I am the King of the Tooth, dead. Among all the opponents in my hand, you are the strongest one. You can be proud to die!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corner of his eye suddenly saw a black shadow that rushed over. Göler stopped the action. He jumped to one side, and the collision of gold fell. Although Kim’s attack was a surprise, it was impossible to threaten the fighters of Geller at his level. The magician overpowered, and he rushed out five or six steps before stopping his momentum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greg looked at the magician who turned around. For him, Kim’s move at the moment was simply a dead end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are talking about two duels with us. Have you not beaten me yet?" Kim tried hard to attract Geller's attention, even though he is now Even one in ten thousand of the hopes for victory did not, but he could not watch Wei and was killed like this. Now for Kim, it will take a while for a while. In the future, Kim did not think about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greuse looked at the magician, his hand is now wearing a magic handcuffs, his face is bloody (so Göller does not recognize him) One hand is swollen like a small bucket, and the other hand holds a sword in a very irregular position. Maybe he is very powerful as a magician, but when he picks up the sword, he is no different from a lamb to be slaughtered. His current posture is very hard to hold the sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a loyal partner! Geller thought in his heart that in order to reward the human magician for not being afraid of death, Göll decided to kill the magician before killing the soldier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He began to walk to the magician, his hammer of the god of war did not lift, so he hanged in his hand, but the magician has retreated Although his sword system is to this half-orc. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a figure at the entrance to the glade, and he was covered with a masked cloak that only showed his eyes, from his movements and the exposed furry hands. Look, he is an old half-orc with a little age. On his shoulder, there is an animal named "baby" at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's the time!" Old Locke is glad that he has arrived in time, but he has no time to kill, he immediately grabbed from his shoulders. Baby - this little guy is about the size of an eagle at the moment, can't be called a "small" animal - he pours a pack of powder that he has prepared before into the baby's mouth before the baby comes and reacts. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The baby is flying into the sky, the degree of spicyness of the powder is beyond anyone’s imagination, and even the sense of taste is not very sensitive, this race has no way to bear it, poor The baby is full of mouths and fires (real fire-breathing), painful and screaming - unfortunately this does not reduce the spicy taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the dragon is uploaded over the head, and the half-beasts all look up at the dragons that are on their heads. At this moment, there was a dragon in the sky above the open-air battlefield. No one knows where the behemoth came from, as if it appeared in the sky in a flash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red, like a burning flame-like scale, because the hot can not stand the bloodshot eyes, the white, the huge, longer than the long gun Tooth decay, huge and sharp claws, huge wings, a huge tail with a length of more than ten meters, and the most terrible flame that is spurting with short breath, all of which constitute a body length close to fifty The daunting image of the dragon of the meter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone, including the gold and the Greer, who are facing each other, look at the behemoth above their heads. At this moment, the barking of this red dragon is because of the screaming of the hot, but it is easy to be mistaken for the roar of anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The loyal guards rushed over and they must immediately take the king of teeth to a safe place. At this moment, Wei and Zheng, who are lying on the ground, are stunned. Gold is gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several guards attacked the dragons in the sky, they shot arrows to the dragon's belly, but for the dragon scales that are five centimeters thick, only It seems to be scratching, but it provokes the baby's attack. At this moment, he is looking for a venting object. The feeling of the throat smoldering makes him rush to vent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scene is terrible, the dragon baby (???) suddenly rushed to the middle of the half-orc, bite with the teeth, step on the claws, sweep with the tail With the flame spray, in the first few minutes, the half-orcs who used the hundred calculations died under this attack. The weapon of the Orc can only make him more angry, killing the Orcs and working harder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door of the arena opened, and a team of half-orc guards rushed in, but the fire column that the baby spurted immediately made this one hundred people without even the bones. under. Although the body is huge, but the baby is not too heavy and heavy, he can accurately attack each casualty and bite them together with the bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get up, Wei, we must go right away!" But at this moment, Wei has no way to move. He can't move with one finger at the moment, and it is too difficult for the current gold to lift him up. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two masked half-orcs rushed to the front, and Kim hurried to grab the sword that he had thrown aside. It is only by him that he can defend both of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's us! Kim!" Behan hurriedly pulled down the cloak, and now Kim recognized that the half-orc was actually his companion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it you? What happened..." Blonde asked, but Old Locke interrupted Kim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no time to explain! We must leave now! Kid, immediately take the warrior away, he can't move now!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the help of Kim and Old Locke, Behan picked up Wei, but Wei’s eyes were desperately looking at a place. Kim immediately understood Wei’s thoughts. He ran over and picked up Destroy the sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Young man, how can you be put on this thing?" Old Locke stared at the handcuffs on the golden hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this?" "This is a scorpion! Use the power of God of War to absorb the energy released by the magician. This is a half-orc in ancient wars." Used to deal with the capture of human magicians. As long as this thing is in the hand - not necessarily in the hand - the magician will never want to use magic!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "How can I get it!" Kim asked anxiously, and he is now eager to get this thing down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no way, unless you can isolate the power of God of War! Or the Orc priest of the Orcs to take it. Otherwise it can't be destroyed! And..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is to cut your hands!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isolating the power of a god is simply impossible, and now I am looking for a half-orc who is willing to help them - and must be a priest of God of War - even more delusional In a flash, Kim made a choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Locke, you cut my hand for me!" Kim said firmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you really decide this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, instead of magic, I I would rather lose my hands!!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a hint of appreciation in Old Locke’s eyes, but it faded away immediately. He took the Demon Sword from Kim’s hand. . Old Locke’s eyes suddenly stared at the Demon Sword. After a few seconds, Old Locke confirmed that his eyes didn’t lie to him. He gave a pleasant voice. “Young! You have saved, this 'fang’ can Get rid of this handcuff!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"獠牙?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, this sword The name is fangs, it is the last sword of the world, it can seal the power of the gods!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Locke waved his teeth The sorcerer went, and the handcuffs that Wei had no way to destroy were opened in the face of the demon sword like a horse dung paper, and the things that bound the gold were finally destroyed. Now Kim can use magic again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go!" Old Locke handed the Demon Sword to Behan and urged him to leave immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behan immediately ran to the door where they came, and now must cherish every minute. Old Locke once said before they started, they actually only have fifteen minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kim is trying to follow Behan, but Old Locke blocked him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's the matter!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He can escape along a safe route, you can't The two of us must draw the attention of the half-orcs so that they can leave safely!" Old Locke said while pouring some potions from a bottle onto the swollen, powerful arm of Kim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Locke, what are we going to do now?" Kim is actually very strange about Locke’s true identity. I thought that the old Locke was a magician, but he now uses medicine (the medicine is a technique that uses grass and wood to treat diseases or hurts, but because of the existence of the therapist, this technology is very challenging. There is not much market. Only in remote areas, medicine is still circulating. Magicians will never use this technology because they think it will lower their own identity.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Look at the excitement for a while!" Old Locke reveals the lazy spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 04<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this arena, torn, more precisely, yes The slaughter is still going on, the red dragon has destroyed this arena half, and has killed the half-orcs calculated by thousands. The reason why only such a result is achieved is that the dragon has an adult body, but has no experience and knowledge to adapt to the body. He does not use any magic, and mainly uses physical attacks instead of the flame of death. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people in a safe place are watching - a nervous look, a way to appreciate - this battle, half-orcs worth Fortunately, there are some God of War priests on the scene, and their existence greatly reduces the damage caused by the death flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The baby in the battle (venting ???) suddenly feels the burning sensation in his mouth disappears, but this time there is just a half-orc Attacking him in the back, the long sword pierces from the gap between the scales of the hind legs (in the dragon, except for the scales of the abdomen, the back, the legs, the tail, the head, etc.) The gap exists), which brings him a sting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The baby swept his huge tail and cut off the important supporting pillar while sweeping the half-orc. . In a flash, the walls of half of the arena fell down and pressed the dragon together with countless half-orcs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Old... Mr. Locke, where did you get this dragon? Should he be a dragon?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes! You should have seen the dragon picture even if you haven’t seen the real dragon! It’s really a red dragon, the most ferocious one among the dragons, but it’s very cute!” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A small animal vibrating with wings is making a cry While flying to the two people present, the baby’s eyes were all wronged and tears, and it looked very pitiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s baby! How is it here?” The baby who has never been close to Kim has now flew into the arms of Kim, and Kim noticed that his tail is bleed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't cry, hey!" Old Locke gave the cheap fake smile of a child, and he took a thing from his pocket and put it on the baby. In front of you, "Look, this is a reward for your brave behavior!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The baby immediately stopped crying, and it immediately rushed to the hands of old Locke, from his Grab the glowing gem in your hand. The love of their race for the glowing things temporarily overwhelmed everything else. It was holding a gem and biting and licking, and the tears in his eyes had already flown to the country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Locke looked around, at this moment he has taken off all the disguise, and people will never see him as a half-orc. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Young people! It seems that we are going to run away! But we have to do something first!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;金 simply can't understand why Old Locke still doesn't leave, but at this moment he only listens to this old man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orcs finally recovered from the chaos caused by the Red Dragon, they regained their organization and were ready to fight again. But they can no longer find the red dragon that suddenly appeared. Just like his sudden appearance, the red dragon suddenly disappeared under the ruins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is that?" Geller asked a war god pastor beside him, although Göller was a well-informed half-orc, but he never Haven't heard of it - of course, haven't seen it - dragon. (The half-orc does not know the existence of the dragon)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know, it's the adventurers! Gera didn't destroy them all! It must be that they came to save their accomplices!" From the fangs of the King of Tooth, everyone can know that General Gera has no hope. It is. "If I let them catch them, I keep them safe and let them regret to be born in this world! Pass my orders! The whole city is martial! I have to dig all the hidden mice!!" But in fact, this order is not necessary. Because the adventurers in the arena are not neglected (???) at the moment, they have done something remarkable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "See? It is the officer! It seems that he is a general conductor! Use the fireball to kill him!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But Mr. Locke! If we do this, then have we ran?" Kim knows what the consequences of doing so - they may be swallowed by the half-orcs. To be honest, at this moment, the Orcs have not noticed that these two humans are an incredible thing in themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stupid! They have no commander and will fall into chaos again! We will be awkward!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Gold felt that he still listened well, so he began to prepare for magic. He did not notice the old Locke's linguistic disease, nor did he notice the guilt in his eyes at the moment. What kind of "machine" do they want? People have been saved, and the chances of escaping have just been very high. What they really need now is just to leave quietly and unobtrusively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fireball hit a half-orc officer who was commanding soldiers to search the ruins so unprepared, and he made a painful voice in the flames. But the next priest of the god of war immediately rushed up, not knowing what he did, the magical flame was immediately extinguished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every half-orc has noticed these two magicians who don’t know how to live (Old Locke is also a magician dress), their nerves are now in extreme tension and In the fragility, this courageous action of these two men became the vent of all the half-orcs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do we do?!" Looking at the half-orc who surged like a tidal wave, Kim nervously asked the old Locke around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Idiot! Of course, use our feet! Hurry up! Get caught by them, but even the bones will not be left!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah?!..." But now it’s too late to say anything, and Kim has no choice but to follow this old man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people escaped from the small door. After they went out, Old Locke immediately closed the door and took out the key and put the door Lock it up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This... Mr. Locke, where did you steal this key?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's really rude! How can someone like me steal it? I was responsible for the door that was dedicated to the gladiator door? I don't have a key, who should have the key?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden eyes can't say a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-beast is desperately attacking the door, but the door is too strong, and the hard wood makes the heavy sword and the axe only stay. The next one is not a deep trace. The door is ten minutes for the time of two humans, and ten minutes is enough for the two humans to have only two small points in the field of pursuit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gerler’s order was passed down. At this moment, all the half-orcs focused on the two escaped humans, and naturally ordered Explain that to seize these two people, in the case of such a clear goal, no one thinks that there are other adventurers who have no way to run. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Orcs began to catch up, the two men had already ran away from the square outside the arena that was vulnerable to siege and began to be inside the streets of the city and half-orcs. Be fascinated. Because of the carnival all night, the residents of this city are not sleeping at home in the area of ​​the arena, so there is no accident on the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go here!" Old Locke ran and said to Kim, he looked familiar to the streets here. "Bent to the left, there is an alley where you can reach the entrance of the tunnel through the alley."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold follows the old Locke, there is a The alley, the only thing different from what Old Locke said is that it is a dead end. Two people stopped in front of the stone wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I used the explosive ball to open it!" Kim volunteered, but this proposal was opposed by the old Locke. "If you want to open this stone wall, you must have at least eight explosions (the magic overlaps eight times). How much time do you want? Or turn back early!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The two talents ran halfway back, and a group of half-orcs appeared in front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orcs’ faces are slowly approaching with a smirk, and they know that these two humans are now mice in the bag. There is nowhere to escape on both sides, the magician knows that this battle is inevitable, and he immediately began to use it to deal with multiple enemies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orcs saw a glowing sphere in the hands of Kim, and they immediately knew what it was. The Orcs immediately split into very loose formations, and with a blasting ball there was no way to destroy them all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Kim knows that the situation is not good, once he releases the blasting ball, the remaining half-orcs will lick him to release the gap before the second magic. Rushing up, it's all over, but he has no other way, he will not release the blast ball and the orcs will slowly push over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Young people, don't let out the whole explosion of the blast ball, first divide it into small pieces and release it!" The old Locke voice came from the ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Divided into small pieces? But how is this possible?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old Locke on the side is also anxious "Why not? This is the energy you summoned? Since you can summon it, why can't you divide it into small pieces?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I really don't know what to do!" Kim is also very anxious now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Imagine, imagine, work hard to divide the explosive ball into small pieces with the will! Be sure to calm your mind, don't panic!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the situation is critical at the moment, the old Locke’s words seem to have some kind of power, and Kim’s mood begins to calm down. He closes his eyes and imagines that he is using an invisible hand. Divide the blast ball into small particles one by one. When he opened his eyes (in fact, it was only a few seconds), he saw that the blast ball had been divided into countless small particles, scattered around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 05<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glowing blast particles now wrap the magician, this situation Even the magician himself was surprised, but he immediately returned, and he wanted to attack these half-orcs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but at this moment, Kim has no way to control such a large number of energy particles at the same time, although he tries to spur magic, but only one or two particles fly to the Orcs. And have not hit yet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orcs were also stunned at the moment, and they saw that the human being was suddenly surrounded by particles of light, and no one knew what had happened. They could not help but stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stupid! Why don't you use the wind to push the blast particles?" Old Locke has also discovered the gold situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well...but can the wind push the blasting ball?" Kim has never heard of using the wind to push the fire (explosive fire is the magic of fire). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as you like, then you can! They are all the energy that you summoned! Since it is the energy that you control, then why not? What?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the use of the second magic is very laborious, there is no other choice for Kim at the moment, he began to meditate on the prayer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intensive explosive granules swooped over to the half-beasts under the influence of the wind, and there was no way to dodge in this relatively small alley. Each burst of blasting energy is enough to blow a piece of flesh and blood on the body, as long as it is hit by the throat, head, chest and abdomen can cause fatal damage. And the fastest half-orcs that are chasing are not wearing enough to withstand the power of this explosion. The screams of fear and the screams of pain are screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the magic finally came to an end, the two humans were covered with incomplete bodies, this chasing squad, about thirty or so orcs, all The corpse is in this alley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't believe that the power of my magic is louder than the ear of gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this really just the power of a blasting ball?" Kim asked Old Locke in an incredible tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, as long as you change a little bit of mode, magic can exert a powerful power! Unfortunately, the current magicians are stuck in the old model's basket. There is no way to adapt to the situation according to the situation... Don't say it, let's take this opportunity to escape!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the leadership of Old Locke, two people seven Turning a corner of the road and a lot of streets and alleys, gold wandering, he felt that he has been spinning in one place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"See, here!" When two people just got out of an alley, a voice came from the left, and immediately, the two were in A team of half-orcs chased down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people ran hard, but the sound of the iron boots behind them not only disappeared, but also getting closer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Young people! It seems that we have to use a way to get rid of these nasty guys, otherwise we can't escape," Old Locke said breathlessly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you deal with them with explosive bombs?" Kim was also a breathless answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stupid! Don't you see what's behind you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold turned around, at The leader of the chasing team is a costume-specific half-orc. He doesn’t even have weapons, and behind him is a heavily armed reloading soldier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the leader?" "It’s the priest of God of War! Haven’t you heard of it? They have the elemental covenant,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any four elemental magic (ground, wind, water, fire) and derived elemental magic (ice, light, thunder, acid) are ineffective for them. The only magic that can have an effect on them, There are only magical bullets and sacred (except for the gods) and death (that is, the princes) two magics without any attributes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So what do I do? "Although I don't understand a lot of proper nouns, Kim still knows that the old Locke's general meaning is <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what. "You didn't hear the sound? They all wore iron boots!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"????"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Stupid, what happens if the iron boots step on the ice?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold immediately understands what Old Locke wants to say, he runs I began to meditate on the prayers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Young people, you listened well!" After Kim was ready, Old Locke said, "The magician has to do is to manipulate energy!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You must not be bound by a fixed spell mode, you must decide how to release the magic according to the actual situation! To play your own imagination, you can definitely play better than yourself. Imagine even more powerful combat power!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The ice and snow elf flying in the north! Give your strength to me for a while..." While reading the mantra, although this "ice cone" magic is used to quickly create a frozen cone with a cone of ice to attack the enemy, but at this moment the gold slowly releases the frozen air to the ground behind it. This kind of control is really very laborious, and Kim must go all out to make the magic energy not be released. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a slamming sound behind him. The two people didn’t have to look back and knew what was going on. On the smooth ice, wearing iron boots is definitely not going to run. It is very difficult to even go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the ice left by the gold, a hundred orcs together with the priest of the god of war, all smashed into a ball - there are several unlucky guys When I fell, I was hurt by my own weapon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Look! That is the well, that is the entrance to the dark road!" After turning a corner, Old Locke pointed to a well in front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a darkness in the cave, and nothing can be seen. Kim is behind the old Locke, and slowly moves forward with a low foot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Old man! What is the elemental covenant you just said?" The gold who walked behind suddenly asked, even at this moment, his curiosity remained. Not weakened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Locke turned back, and if there was light at this time, then Kim could see the expression of appreciation on Locke’s face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is the covenant with the elemental elves. As long as you can complete this covenant, you can not be hurt by the elf power that has a covenant with you! However, you want to sign It is very difficult to make such a covenant. It must be tested by the elves and the elf king. Moreover, there is only one chance in a person's life. Once he has not passed the test, the elves will not give him a second chance!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The War priests have this kind of covenant?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, so, great Some of the magic is not useful for the priests of the war! I will remember later, if you encounter the priest of the god of war, you must escape early, otherwise you will use the magic bomb to solve them earlier!" Old Locke used a self-talking The tone said, "If the War Priest joins the Wild Bet Corps, the human advantage - the magician will be offset by a large part. It's really a headache!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; After a few minutes of silence, Kim asked again: "Mr. Locke ? I can have elements of the Covenant it "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; old Locke was taken aback, but can not see his face in the dark gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can I do it?" Because the old Locke did not answer, Kim asked again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course! As long as you are willing to pay a price!" Old Locke's tone reveals sadness, but the magician at the moment did not hear it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you tell me what to do?" Gold suppressed the excitement in my heart. When he thought that he could immunize most of the magic, Kim felt a ecstasy. At this moment, he even forgot that he was still on his way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Young people! For you, who is the most important person in the world!" Old Locke suddenly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dad, Mom, brothers and sisters, and my friends!" Kim stunned, but he quickly recovered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the most important thing for you?" "Magic!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If One side is your most important person, and the other side is magic. You have to choose between the two. What do you want to do?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold does not go deep Thinking of this problem, he simply put this problem on his past experience (in the past he used to leave home to pursue magic), he simply answered "Of course it is to choose magic!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Young people, you will regret it later!" The sentence almost blurted out, but Locke pressed the words to his lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, if there is a chance, I will teach you how to do it! The most important thing is to go out soon!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the light finally appeared, the two men had been gone for an hour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s finally out!" Kim took a deep breath. After passing through this dark tunnel and confirming that he has escaped the control of the Orcs, Kim has a feeling of being reborn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two are now on a hillside in the suburbs of Cyril, with few shrubs on the hills, although not very high, but providing cover for two people It is enough. After confirming his safety, Kim felt that his feet had softened and lost his feeling. He sat down on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Found it! Hey! Old age, I forgot where things are, but fortunately, I finally found it!" Hearing the sound of Old Locke, Kim wanted to stand up with his hands. At this moment, he discovered that his hand had completely lost its effect. Old Locke's medicine only temporarily suppressed the pain, and the injury on the opponent did not have much help. The activity of climbing the well wall just now has caused more damage to his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
