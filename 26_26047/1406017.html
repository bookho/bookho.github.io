			<div id="content">Several soldiers are laughing at the passage that is not known to many people, talking about what happened just now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They just need to stand up to Tianming, tomorrow, this tunnel will be completely sealed, lest the unwelcome dwarfs pop out again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The dwarves are so arrogant, huh, huh... they actually say that they want to declare war on humans... haha, really laugh at me, then all day The dwarfs who deal with the earth dare to say this..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hahaha... I should have used a fire magic to put those dwarfs and The beard burned together and let them go back lightly..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thing suddenly threw it out of someone’s passage and landed on the ground The light click. Even though these few guardians were actually not very alert, they still found this anomaly. Everyone turned to look at the strange things that landed on the ground, but before any one of them realized the danger, the thing burst out with dazzling blue brilliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four people quickly came out of the passageway and saw that the soldiers were now all on the ground and motionless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's amazing, what is this?" Lev looked at the old Rocket picking up the strange little crystal, and he couldn't help but feel a little envious. This thing is really convenient. It's easy to use, so throw it out and solve four people silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is called 'Thunder Shot' and will be strongly struck by a slight impact," Old Locke carefully placed this thing inside a small bag. The answer is, "Although the power is not fatal, it can make people faint. It is a very effective gadget. Of course, the carrier must be careful not to accidentally hit it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Gold glanced at the contents of the old Locke hand, his eyes can see the parts that others can't see, the magician immediately discovered the true face of the lightning strike. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This ball is imprisoned with an elf, and it is a thunder!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He does not endure Living said, he can see that the power of this Thunder is very powerful, so powerful that it can strike lightning through the things that bind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Locke looked at Jin with a little surprise, "Yes," he replied. "You are right. This lightning strike is a magic that has gone." Made in the ages, use magic to bind those powerful elves to serve humans... Don't say, we must go quickly. These people don't care, if I am not wrong, no one will come here this evening. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know where it is. Kim guessed that it should be the palace, but the old Locke is very familiar with this belt, taking them to the left and right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They didn’t meet anyone along the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he walked to a cloister, Old Locke stopped and turned and said to the three people behind him: "The gems are inside." He pointed his finger at the cloister A door in the courtyard at the end of the left side said, "I can feel it, you are here to look at the door, don't let people come in, I will go to get the gems!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "But..." Kim stepped forward. He didn't want to be thrown away at this last minute. Although this kind of thing is probably impossible to be known by others, he hopes to get this feat that will make him proud of his life - one The opportunity for mankind to be saved from the crisis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, you don't understand!" Old Locke knows what these young people think. "The jewel is not what you think, it is very dangerous." Anything that sees it can't resist the desire to take it for itself. It can blind the wisdom of the wise, can distort the mind of the brave... I don't trust you, but you should believe me, it It's not something we humans should have! Only the dwarf can use this thing to inspire inspiration and wisdom. For humans, it only triggers yu."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But..." Kim said that he had swallowed it before he said it. Old Locke just took a serious look and let him close his mouth. When the old man is serious, he always exudes a force that cannot be explained by gold. It is an attractive force that obeys his inability to defy. They silently watched the old Locke's footsteps disappear on the other side of the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three chose the ambush behind the door. If any unlucky guy had to walk through the door, he would have to prepare for the numbness of the gold. Wei’s fist, and Lev’s hand in his hand to prepare a flying knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did Old Locke know these things? Although he seems to be a little unbelievable, he can't help but know too much: even if other things can be explained by well-informed, even the news that the Orcs must form an alliance with the dwarf can be mastered. Exaggerated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, he just made it clear that there is nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person can resist the temptation of the Luoding gem, so they have to stay with them, but they are going to take it themselves. Is he not afraid of temptation? Although there is a voice in his heart telling him that Old Locke should not deceive them, the analysis of reason seems to give an opposite answer. Although Old Locke has not answered his question positively, now Kim is more certain that the person who calls Noubis is the old Locke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who is the old Locke?" Kim heard Lev talking to himself behind him, and it seems that he is not the only one to reflect and question. Yes, who is sucking at the old Rocky? Mastering such a huge mystery, with so much wisdom and strength, Lao Locke is definitely not a general figure. Such a person is absolutely impossible to be obscured. Locke must be just a pseudonym. He also has a real name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Someone is coming!" Wei gave a very low warning, pulling Kim back to reality from the cranky thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spell of paralysis immediately jumps into the mind of the magician, and he gathers all the spirits like a beast that is ready to attack. Judging from the sound, there is only one person, and there should be no arming, because the footsteps of his walking are relatively light, and there is no murmur of accidental collision of steel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leif pinches the knife in his hand and makes a gesture before throwing, and the other hand pulls another from the belt, just in case . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice is getting closer and closer, and the three exchanged their eyes and reached a tacit understanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paralysis! When the man had just revealed the first trace on the door, Kim did not hesitate to release the magic, and then the soldier rushed past the fastest speed, punching the head of the person. They don't want to kill people here, because there is no reason to kill them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fist stopped at the start of the millennium, because the warrior judged her gender from the figure of the person - the person is a woman: this person is very obvious It is an ordinary maid, which can be seen from the standard dress on her body. The magician's magic played its due role in her. The woman had completely lost her ability to act. Only one pair of eyes showed the horror that could not be concealed, and looked at the huge shadow that suddenly jumped out and fell in front of her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei hesitated a little, he didn’t want to attack a woman who actually lost her ability to act, but he also knew that the effect of paralysis was limited, and the magician again Need to save the magic to cope with the accident, only to stun her is the best choice. So he slammed into the back of the woman as lightly as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moonlight of this evening is really bright, but the leaves of the trees on the head of the adventurer unfortunately blocked most of the light, so Wei did not notice the girl’s hand. s things. As she stumbled down, the porcelain in her hand fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this porcelain is just an ordinary water bottle, although this crisp porcelain crack is not loud, but in this quiet night, this unique sound Caused the attention of those who are alert to the ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well!" When the sound rang, Kim knew it was not good. The only hope now is that there are no people in the vicinity. After all, it is impossible to make a far-reaching sound, but if there are people nearby, their ears will not let go of this voice! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is there?" A man’s voice came over, and then the sound of jogging was mixed with a little metal sound in the running sound. Obviously, this person is a guard, and if not, at least it is an armed person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We use the fastest speed to pull the maid who can't wake up in a short time, and the adventurers will immediately prepare for the same situation as the one just before. Two prey. Everyone squeezed a sweat and waited, but the other did not rush into it. Just because the footsteps that were particularly loud in the silence stopped in front of the trap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Quickly go out!" After a short wait, Kim immediately knew what had happened and shouted loudly to the soldier who was ready to go, then He also rushed out. It was the water bottle. Just Wei didn't have time to take the water bottle off. The man noticed these inexplicable pieces of debris on the ground. A slightly cautious person will think of this pile of debris for an inevitable reason and immediately make the most appropriate action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Worst of all, Kim Desperate found that the guard was running towards a big bell hanging on the wall. He knows that as long as the guards forcefully tear off the cushion of this magical alarm device, the huge ringtone will call all people, whether they are asleep or awake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Locke walks slowly in the courtyard, the footsteps are steady Like an old man walking in his backyard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no silence around, Old Locke knows that there is absolutely no guard in this place, because this is the collection place of the Luoding gem, and the power of this artifact can be offset. Any loyalty. There are no human guards here, and there are at most only magic traps or guards, and the latter two cannot threaten him at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the information is not wrong, this place should be the secret room of Emperor Victor and his actual bedroom. In order to guard against assassins who do not know where they will suddenly appear, powers often have multiple palaces, but generally only one is real, and it is the only possible place for gemstones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So late, the sleeping person should have fallen asleep. Old Locke looked at the building while considering the question of where to start searching. He has enough time, and only one or two maids will come in to do some routine cleaning work every night, and the guards responsible for guarding this area are an elite team - these troubles will be solved by the three young people. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A vigilant rushed into the heart of old Locke, and then this instinctive intuition crisis became a real threat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was suddenly pushed away from inside, and a figure wearing a white robe appeared in the sight of Old Locke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are you?" Brett asked with a panic, but the panic quickly disappeared because of his confidence in his strength. He is no longer the great magician of the past. Now, even if he is facing the teacher of the past, the great magician Raymond, he has the confidence to deal with it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Locke looked at the young man without saying a word, this silence added to the power of Brett, this old man does not seem to be the Emperor of Victor The guard here is an uninvited guest like him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately made a decision in his heart, and he could not let this person who saw him appear to be alive and must be resolved quickly and silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Petrochemical!" Brett quickly completed the spell, the speed is almost incredible, the magic accurately hits the old Locke standing still, secretly surging The energy of the pounce on the old man, to transform him from the biological world to the mineral world, but to Brett's surprise, petrochemical magic does not seem to work for this old man, no matter the skin or clothes, there is no change in the old Locke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is it possible?" Brett took a step back in the horror, and he determined that the opponent had not used any defensive magic. This unheard of strange things made him feel that he couldn’t help feeling A guilty conscience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is impossible, it must be that he added defensive magic to himself before."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;布Wright comforted himself and immediately started the next solid magic. "Maybe it doesn't look so bad. The old man is motionless. He must be fighting the petrochemical magic. If you add a little strength, you can solve it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Death of quicksand!" A red light hit the foot of the old Locke, the solid land immediately turned into quicksand, to devour the person standing on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This magic is one of the most widely attacked magical spells that is hard to defend. It will drag everything in the attack range into the earth, but let Brett fear it. Yes, this man still stood still on the ground, the sand under his feet kept squirming, but he stood unaffectedly on this quicksand that could not withstand the pressure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Locke looked at the young magician coldly, he already recognized the identity of this person, although the magical power of this person and what he knows Not exactly met. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright began to panic, he didn’t know what the mysterious power was guarding this seemingly ordinary old man, and what happened in front of him was more than he recognized. The scope of knowing. He took a step back and the result was smashed by the threshold he had just taken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't... don't come over..." Brett mourned. "I'm wrong... please forgive me..." He had a horrible look on his face, and he had long felt like a ghost. He thought he had the identity of the other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't insult the saints' intentions..." he said, and then he touched the gem that gave the light that all creatures could not resist. Come out, "I just want to take a look at this gem... that's it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright felt a cold snap as soon as he thought of the warning from the Sayādaw Direct impact on the deepest part of the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since seeing this jewel, the kind of zhan that has this rare treasure has taken root in his heart. The deadly call has been echoing around him, never stopped, and at most it was only temporarily suppressed when his attention was attracted by other things, so he came here on this night and tried to take the gem. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't do anything..." Brett looked desperately at the old man's body getting closer and closer, and he knew that the sages were cruel and cruel. The demon is definitely not a meaningless threat. He desperately cursed why he had such stupid thoughts and tried to plead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that this person who is immune to any magic is one of the messengers of the Lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Locke stepped forward and grabbed the gems from the hands of Brett's trembling. The old man’s body trembled slightly in an instant. When the hand is in contact with the gem, an indescribable pleasure feels flowing from the point of contact into the body and spreads through every organ of his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lodin Gem releases all of its power and tries its best to seduce new holders. The colorful light almost blinded his eyes, leaving him with nothing but gems, and the hand became a passage through the gem, which eroded the will he tried to resist. As long as it is human, even if he has a steely will, he is unable to resist this temptation. This is an attraction that transcends instinct, transcends the senses, and transcends the mind, so that all the creatures do not consciously want to attract the zhan. force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No!" With a scream, Old Locke's hand was loose, letting this artifact slip from his hand. This temptation is too strong, and even if the mind is already prepared, it still makes him almost unbearable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s really dangerous..." Old Locke smeared the cold sweat on his head with his hand, and the jewels of Luoding were even more terrible than the legend, even if he was directly The contact is too dangerous. If you don't pay attention or shake it, the temptation will take root in his heart, and then grow into an unshakable tree. If it is not just let go, he may not escape the fate of becoming a gem slave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright was surprised to see the move of the man he thought was the messenger. The man took a handkerchief from his pocket and grabbed the gem placed on the floor across the cloth. This unusual move seems to go beyond the ability of the Sayādaw, but under the influence of the preconceived notion, no matter how exaggerated the action of the old Locke, he dare not stop. Just watch the old Locke pack the jewel with a bandanna and put it in his pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s finally finished, this is an exceptionally smooth one." Old Locke looked at the young man with a scornful look. Brett looked at him whitishly, his body motionless. He knew that the power that this young magician had that did not match his age came from the demon, but he did nothing, just looking at Bright's white face and making the face whiter until fear and In the horror, he completely lost his blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a shock in the air, so that the old and the young who were squatting clearly felt the coming of this powerful force. Old Locke turned and looked at the source of the power. His gaze passed through the open door and saw what was slowly emerging in the air. It was a body covered in a huge black cloak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Abominable!" The magician chased and prepared a new prayer. He tried in vain to destroy the alarm before the person started the alarm, and the other two Fully chasing, but the difference in distance makes it impossible for them to stop the guards who want to start the alarm in time. If this time, Behan is just fine, the magician does not feel a bit regretful, the power of Behan's magic sword can catch up with this person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two shadows suddenly appear behind a front door, between the flying figure and the alarm device. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a reinforcement!" Lev felt a chill in his heart. He also hoped that he could rely on the advantage of the number to lay the guard as soon as possible, but this hope also It’s over. If the old Locke just gave that ball to himself, it is time to play its role. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A force rushed up from the guard's feet, mixed with earth and stone hitting the guard's body, knocking him to the ground, and he was lying on the ground and could not move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s Behan!" Seeing this familiar scene, everyone immediately recognized the two companions in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three people ran away in surprise and joy? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" actually squatting out of us!" Behan ran over. "Without me, you can't do anything well!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Locke and His Holiness silently confronted each other for a while. Bright, standing on one side, looked at the pair inexplicably, but he had already sniffed a little bit from the atmosphere filled with the whole space. The eyes of the Sayādaw hidden in the shadow of the cloak are shimmering with strange light. It is a kind of gaze that looks for the weakness of the opponent when confronted with a strong enemy. Old Locke used an indifferent expression to face the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to this seemingly mutual observation, the two sides also carried out a fierce attack and defense at the spiritual level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Savior tried to break the opponent’s defense and probe the other’s heart, but this effort was quickly forced to give up, and the old Locke’s defense was impeccable, he Can't penetrate each other's mental defense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello..." Sayādaw first broke this silence, "Guardian!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Guardian?" Old Locke was obviously stunned by this title, but immediately calmed down, his face with a scornful smile, "You actually call me a guardian... It’s interesting."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How to call it doesn't make sense to us!" The frog's voice, like the frog in the box, rose a little, trying to make his tone sound milder, but this The unspeakable voice made the effort in vain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't master you, just as you can't master me. I know that you also have the context of the world, so your conflicts are meaningless. I only hope that you will leave that jewel so that you can avoid all unnecessary troubles!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Locke put on a smile as if he were on the street The first smile when meeting the adventurers, "If I reject you this friendly proposal?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two sides are in silence again, without each other Actions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright moved to the Supreme, although he still doesn't know the whole thing, but he has judged from the conversation that the old Locke is definitely not the messenger of the Supreme. And each other is likely to be hostile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sir, he..." His words were interrupted by the other party before he finished speaking, and his master responded with enthusiasm in his cold voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Roll!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright has not been able to respond to this simple sentence for a while He stayed where he was until he got a clearer answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Get out of here, there is nothing for you here. I don't want to steal the gems of Luoding."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Locke looked at the young man in a white robe and left, and then the demon's gaze turned to him again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If we use force to fight, do you have the confidence to win me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The voice of the person became cold again, his eyes fixed on Old Locke. "Although I don't want to use force:"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." Old Locke He answered it straight away and put away his smile. "I don't think there is anyone in the world who dares to say that you have a victory with one of the devils! And the only weapon that can destroy you is not in my hands!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know a lot..." The Sayādaw took a step forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No more than you." Old Locke also took a step forward, "But as you said, I also understand the direction and flow of the times, will not resist This great will."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't stop this change, no one can stop this change!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Locke stood still, although there was no wind, but his white hair and The beard began to flutter under some kind of power. "What I want to stop is the promoter behind this goal through the power of this flow. Although the change can't stop, the way can be different, I don't know your true purpose. But I know that all this can be achieved with less sacrifice and less bloodshed. And you..." Old Locke added a tone, "Desperately push and accelerate this change, just to make this continent full. "Human bones!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe..." Sayādaw easily avoided the old Locke's words, and he took another step forward, "but at the beginning Didn't it also have a lot of blood when I created this order? It doesn't matter if it flows again for the new order... I understand, it turned out to be... Haha... I know who you are, but you Why do you want What do you do?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Know, "He added a tone," you are no longer human."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am just for atonement..." Old Locke replied gently, "Redemption of the mistakes I made in the past."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, It seems that we have nothing to talk about." The Sayādaw went further, and the distance between him and the old Locke was actually less than five meters. In the moonlight, his tall figure in a black hijab cloak became a bit gloomy and strange. "Now I only talk with strength!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How come you come "Gold is a little surprised to ask two companions, if not they appear in time, then it is now unimaginable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because the traces left by you all the way are too obvious!" Elna said with a smile. "We found out when you and Old Locke went out, so Sneak all the way to the back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, you are here, it’s timely, I just thought I was going to die." Lev took the call. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s just luck. After that tunnel, we can’t find you, and we’re going around, but fortunately we haven’t encountered any patrols.” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A painful encounter was revealed from the guard who was defeated by the power of the sword of the earth, reminding the five people that he was still alive. Although the robbers did not have the obligation to treat the soldiers, the five people did not become conscious of the robbers, so Elna began to heal the person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is that the case?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, you can sleep!" After Jin finished speaking, he followed a hypnotism and let the person close his eyes. If there is no external interference, the power of this magic will at least allow this person to sleep until tomorrow night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guards have just provided very important information. If he said nothing wrong, this night, there are only five guards nearby - the other four have already It was solved by the electric shock of the old Locke at the tunnel entrance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others are concentrated in the area where the dinner is held, and, more importantly, there will be no other than the stunned maid tonight. Others have come here, that is to say, the task of the old Locke can be said to have been completed. The rest is to wait for the old Locke to come back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five people each chose a location that was both concealed and comfortable, so that they could be prepared in case something might happen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold cast a reconnaissance magic, as the guards who have fallen asleep said, there are no people around, at least within this magic range People, the guards should be true, they can wait for the old Locke to come back here. He noticed that Wei, who was not far from him, stood up again. This was the third time he stood up. It seems that there is some kind of thinking that is bothering this warrior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's the matter, Wei!" The magician walked over and asked. To be honest, Wei’s feelings of being uneasy are really rare, and people have to wonder if there have been any major accidents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have something to leave." Wei replied a little annoyedly, "Gold, can you accompany me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone has no objection, although the intelligence that the guards say is a reason, but more importantly, Wei’s irritating expression. Since they formed the team, unless they were extremely urgent, they never saw this indifferent soldier revealing this expression. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reassure, there is me, there should be no problem!" Behan patted Wei’s shoulder and said to him, by the way, with a look of advantage A look at Lev next to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician followed Wei quickly, and he only had a problem after the departure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wei, do you know the way?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, but the general direction can be grasped! The soldier simply replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"About direction?" Gold is even more weird, and can’t help but ask, "What happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I saw her!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She???"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Wei himself said, he really does not know the way of this place, he can only identify the direction, in order to make up for this weakness, The warrior chose the shortest way forward for the sorcerer who followed him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He maintains a standard straight line all the way, no matter what the front is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s the woods that go straight through, the wall is crawling over, the waterhole is also directly wading in the past, no matter what it can't change his unshakable direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is better dressed in armor, but the gold in his mage is down, and his skills are far less flexible than his companions. After the clothes were about to be scraped out of the branches by three or four big mouths, he had to risk the discovery of the reconnaissance magic set in the air - this common preventive measure is always used against those who plan to use flying magic. Enter the magician who doesn't welcome their buildings - through some troublesome obstacles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold does not know the purpose of Wei, the soldiers are very anxious, all the way forward, even some necessary reconnaissance or policing work is not done, he is Driven by a thought, a persistent thought, let him venture so wildly in this strange and dangerous place. The magician carefully followed him and tried not to lag behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold carefully keeps the state of magic at any time, a paralyzed magic that has been overlapped five times, which is the limit of his magic overlap, to ensure that he can deal with it at any time. I don't know which corner to appear from. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But maybe it’s fortunate, maybe for other reasons. In short, the two people actually “have a bon voyage” and have not encountered any obstacles that Kim is worried about. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the reason why the two people will be so smooth is because the Royal Palace is holding a grand royal banquet, this banquet will last for one night, to ensure that this concentration is almost all The safety of the gathering of the nobles, almost all the guards were transferred to the banquet hall to patrol, so the defensive ability of other places was significantly weakened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We finally stopped in front of a taller building, surrounded by red decorative curtains, but not known to the designer. Attention is still just an illusion. It seems that the red cloth that should be lively and festive gives people a feeling of sinister misery. The building under the red cloth is like a strange World of Warcraft lair, as if there is a sultry thing to come forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is here..." Wei said self-speaking, then he decisively went to the door of this strange building, pushing hard, pushing fast, even thinking It’s too late to stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be careful..." The words were spoken, and Wei had already stepped in. The magician wanted to follow the past, but just as he walked to the door, several guards were laughing and laughing from the corner, and one of the head turned to talk to the companion behind him. This is pure luck. If the team is officially patrolling seriously, they must first find gold, at least have the opportunity to issue an alarm, but the topic they are discussing is ruining the opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...With your strength, bind the things that I hate with invisible ropes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"Get out of the way..." Jin Jinmen shouted. He knew that such a team of stiffly standing guards couldn't hide for too long. This kind of thing is absolutely impossible for people. If they don't leave now, they probably won't be able to go. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After seeing the furnishings in the room, Kim swallowed half of it and swallowed it back. Now Kim knows that the decorator of this building is definitely not an accident to let it present this style - this is a morgue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no other decoration in this room, only a crystal coffin is placed in the center of the hall, and a body lies in the middle of this gorgeous crystal coffin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the body of a young man. In fact, this body is destroyed quite seriously. His body is split by some kind of weapon, even if the body is treated. The person carefully concealed, this serious scar still can not completely cover up. He wore gorgeous armor, armor coat with a very popular silk coat in your son, and a diamond-encrusted crown on his head, all of which showed that this man was the royal family of the Leite Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This person is..." It is obviously a huge wound caused by a sharp cut, a luxurious royal crown, and an armor, and almost more than gold. Young age, all kinds of information are accumulated, this person's name is coming out... But this is impossible. Today, during the day, the magician has just participated in the carnival for his wedding! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We walked into the door, and he ignored the large crystal coffin placed in the middle of the house, went straight to the stairs, and walked up the curved staircase. He didn't deliberately cover up his steps, so the sound of his boots on the stairs was easily heard by people upstairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an accident, when they meet with two other companions. Because of the white carnival, there is no light beam that ignites magic tonight, so it can only be illuminated by moonlight and starlight. It is precisely because of this that under the moonlight, the figure of a girl leaning against the railing on a high-rise building in the distance was recognized by the soldiers. come out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who?" A questioning voice was uploaded from the building, how familiar this voice is! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minke turned up and sat up, the footsteps from the stairs she heard very clearly, because she did not fall asleep at all. She thought it was a message from a servant who came in, but the heaviness of the footsteps immediately denied this speculation. When she sat up, she saw the armored body revealing a small body at the stairway. She recognized that the style of the armor was neither the Royal Royal nor the Stima family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minck just wanted to yell, but the familiarity of this steadily figure made her voice disappear to the lips. She stood up weakly, but could not control the trembling of the body. The steady footsteps seemed to be a drum, and each one knocked on her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s him! It’s really him, it’s not wrong! Although the armor is different, but that figure, the way to walk...” she sent out She called softly, and she thought she was very loud, but actually it was as light as a mosquito. The girl covered her mouth with both hands, and the man looking at the stairway turned around. In a flash, her tears blurred her eyes, making her unable to see the expression on the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We walked up the stairs, he didn’t know why he was so impulsive, he ran so fast, and now he is timid, he uses almost an numbness Slowly and slowly turned around and looked at the girl in her pajamas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw that the girl was trying to cover her mouth with her hand, and it looked like a terrified and heart-wrenching look. In this way, the two stood face to face, and Wei suddenly felt a blank inside, and the thousand words that had surged in the heart for a moment were suddenly forgotten. He did not Knowing how to face the girl in front of him, he doesn't even know what he is doing here. Should you blame her forbearance? Why is he? Want to take her away? Is it the adventurer who has no place to live? What else is there between them? She is married today, she is already the wife of others, and has nothing to do with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minck looked at the man in front of him, he looks no different from the previous one, but his eyes have a strong passion that she does not understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she clearly remembers that she almost watched him being swallowed up by the Orc. Seeing so many weapons falling on him, watching his figure disappear quickly in the half-orcs who are constantly encircling, he should have died, how can he not die under that kind of situation? At that time, she could only look at it and watched it happen. It happened so fast that she could not stop it. Now that he has appeared, nothing has changed except for his dress. It appeared on this special night today, after the grand ceremonial offering of her sacrifice - for the benefit of the family, she became a bride of the dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician who hesitated for a while quickly stepped up to chase the warrior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He now feels that Wei is simply crazy, actually came to such a morgue. It is obviously the place where the defense in the palace is more strict. The team guards just now are the best proof. Staying in this place is simply looking for death. When the guards at the door are temporarily found, they may not want to escape. They will say that even if they can escape, they will face a worse one. The troublesome future - to become the number one criminal of the two great powers on the mainland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wei! What are you doing?" Jin three steps and rushed up the stairs in two steps, he did not know what attracted the soldiers, but all this It doesn't matter, if you are tired of old Locke, it's really unforgivable...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Locke...<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The golden mind rushing to the stairs suddenly calmed down, and for a moment he understood what a terrible mistake he had made. Whether they have escaped or not, the group of guards who have been given a paralysis will soon be discovered, and then there will be an inevitable search, and Old Locke - if that time has not completed his mission The words - will inevitably be discovered, the magicians and guards responsible for defense will naturally prevent the stranger from taking the things belonging to the emperor without permission, and then their plans to prevent the alliance between the dwarves and the half-orcs will die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden fruit turned his head and flew out to the door. What Wei should do now has nothing to do with him. He must first be responsible for what he is doing. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don’t hide those inactive guards right away, their entire plan may have to be ruined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We let go of your hand and gently support the good ones in your arms. Obviously his sense of time is now in an extreme contradiction: on the one hand, he feels that this hug has been a long time ago. On the other hand, he feels that this is only a moment, as if they were separated as soon as they touched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I haven’t seen each other for a long time..." Wei spoke, but as soon as he heard it, he found that his words had all betrayed his original intentions, he did not want Let me say that. He could have said something warm and tender, even if he said nothing, it is better than now, and it is much better to say simple greetings in this unusually cold tone! He could see the look that appeared on the girl's face, how the look of the injured lamb made him feel bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to reach out and gently comfort her, but he doesn’t, there seems to be an inexplicable force that limits his actions and makes him stand still. Still, motionless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You... still alive?" Mink gently raised his hand and carefully touched the man's face in front of him. His indifference made her not I dared to touch it for too long, but this was enough. The touch from the hand swept all the doubts in my heart and told her that everything was not a dream, it was true, Wei was still alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes...!" Wei replied softly, his voice reminding Mink of another thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your voice..." She said softly with a smile that only women can perform, and men can never understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The cure is..." Wei’s voice was very low. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Mingke is speechless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two stood at a distance, but there seems to be a sad obstacle between them, and the two are no longer talking, just standing quietly No one knows how to break this embarrassing silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything is too late! No one has yet discovered that Kim immediately began to use the "drift" he had prepared during the hurry. It was a little difficult to move seven separate objects at a time, but Kim did it. He controlled the seven. The body slowly drifted into the building. He intends to get the seven people to the second floor, so that you should be able to delay the discovery to tomorrow - basically no one will come to the morgue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician’s heart is secretly glad, but fortunately this numbness was released in time, and if the guards called out the sound, then he was really finished... ...ah...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who?" Jin Zhirui felt that the root of the interference with his magical power came from behind. He immediately turned and faced a man wearing a white magician's robes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bright? You...what are you here?" The magician made the sound of "horse as the thief was caught" mixed with panic and panic. His question is really stupid. It is a matter of course that Brett is the minister of the Leite Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing... I just want to report the last hatred!" The face of the white robe's magician reveals the kind of hunter who captures the prey and mixes it. Victory and cruel expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The resentful remorse of his own performance in front of the old Locke and the subsequent resentment of the Sayādaw provoked a lot of things that were back in his heart and ignited together. The anger in his heart that is getting stronger but not venting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked aimlessly in the palace, furiously slamming the innocent flowers with a spear - although this move is simply not enough to vent to be frustrated The anger - then he found this familiar figure. There was a cruel smile on Bright's face, and his anger finally had a place to vent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The last hatred?... Wait a minute...Bright, you listen to me..." Kim stepped back and forth in a panic, he knew that as long as Bright Just use a magic that will make a sound, and they will be finished. In this case, he couldn't think of any good way. He had to explain his words and raise words in his stomach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is nothing to say!" Brett pushed forward, "Come on, Kim. I have been waiting for this opportunity for a long time, everything I have tasted, Let me try it now! Let me go, I have laid a nodule, and no one will interfere with us now. We can now decide what is the winner and see who is the winner!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Winning and losing?" After a hard understanding of Bright's intentions, Kim could not help but feel a glimpse, but then he breathed a sigh of relief. It seems that Brett did not intend to call the police, his original fear became redundant. Since his most worrying things don't happen, you don't have to be so scared. The magician stopped the steps of retreating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Begin!" Brett crossed his legs and stood proudly. The courage and confidence that collapsed in the face of the old ruler has now returned to his Body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold was a little surprised to see this past classmate, he couldn’t understand why Bright did it. Think about it, maybe it was the competition two years ago. The magic level of the two people is no different. He relies on his physical strength to win. Perhaps because of this, Bright is always looking for opportunities. He didn't know that Brett hated him because he hadn't know anything about Brett's subsequent experience since he met in the Snow City. Although Brett tried his best to destroy him on the Undead Island, the two did not meet, so Kim did not know his existence. In the case of the flustering just now, Kim accidentally ignored a very important detail - Bright had an enchantment around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enchantment is a high-level defensive magic. It is a combination of a spell and a magical genre. It usually takes a lot of magicians to work together to create it, and Bright is just in In just a short period of time, the enchantment was established by the power of oneself alone, and it was an enchantment that did not depend on the magic array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come on!" Brett made a gesture of letting go and challenged the former Magic Academy. What's more interesting is that the two men's dresses are the same as the last time they played in the ring, Kim was wearing a gray robe, while Brett was wearing a white robe. This may be fate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold does not answer, 趁 this Brett deliberately gave him the opportunity, he first gave himself a defensive magic, so in the subsequent magic battle he will In a favorable position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't you come? Then I'm welcome!" Brett said sarcastically, and then he read a spell that made the golden hair creep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...the wrath of the gods is delivered to my hand, and the light and the inflammation are mastered together, and the sword of sanctions is lowered from heaven to my enemy. On the head..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This spell is..." Kim immediately remembered the contents of the magic book that Wolf gave him, this is "the fire and thunder" The extremely powerful attacking magic, and the "Thunder of God" have the same skill, but the former is suitable for attacking a single enemy, and the latter is suitable for attacking multiple targets. The city’s Wright’s ability to complete this spell is so fast that it’s astounding. Gold is desperate to strengthen the defensive magic while preparing to dodge, because he knows that his defense can’t resist this magical attack, and even if he can successfully escape the magic, he can’t guarantee. The defense on the body can completely resist this magical attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kim saw the sly smile on Brett's mouth, and the anger that was looked down upon him rose from his heart. He stood up and gave up his plan to dodge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...disappeared in the light, hidden in the dark, please listen to my request, please accept my sacrifice, give your strength to me , guarding my body, strengthening my will, so that I can compete with all things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold read the spell of absolute magic defense. Kim is confident in his own strength. He knows that if he uses this magic, he can't break even if it is "fire and thunder." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Bright's spell has not yet been completed, he read the following spell after watching Kim complete the absolute magic defense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...falling black horror from the sky, covering the earth, the shadow of death is covered with earth..." The light ball in his hand began to penetrate into one The new power of the stock, a black energy, the whole light ball turns black, the black flow jumps, ready to burst at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright completed the spell and concentrated on the fire, electricity, and darkness (spirit attack)<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic, he released it, let the ball that radiated black lightning rush to the stunned gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is this possible?" In addition to his teacher, Kim is the first to see that someone can concentrate three kinds of power to release magic, especially mental attack magic. A combination of physical attack magic. How can Bright have this power? But there is no time to think about this problem. When the ball rushes over, Kim does his best to dodge to the side. He knows that even if he can withstand the fire and electric attack, he can't stop the mental attack. Once it is hit, it is not crazy. dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The energy burst out, making a loud noise, relying on absolute magic defense, Kim was not injured by the chop, but was also blown down by the impact and hit a few Rolling, wolverine is abnormal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first attack did not hit, but Bright laughed and saw the wolf in front of him. He was very happy and was first The humiliation is fully vented. He likes to watch the feeling of the weak being struggling in front of himself, especially when the weak is the bull he hates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold just stood up and Brett was ready to go underground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Arrow of Stones!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stones on the ground are lifted by the power of magic, flying fast To the poor goal, although the power of pushing the stone after the absolute magic defense disappears, the inertia still makes them squat to the prey. This unseen magic makes gold only the power of parry. Brett's magic is endless, constantly driving the stone to attack, and the flying stones are getting heavier and heavier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment of attack, Kim can only protect his head and face with his hands, but even if the pain is abnormal, he is still chanting and preparing for defensive magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new protective wall is erected to block the stones, but it is useless. When gold is put down, he sees the new magic of Brett. He just started using "Stone Arrow" and immediately began to prepare another magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Electrode bomb!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lightning strikes, dodge is too late, only by magic Hard block, Kim feels the constant consumption of the magic, the absolute magic defense successfully blocked this fatal blow, but the magic of gold is also consumed more than half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is still!" The new power formed in front of Brett, his magic is still sufficient, just now everything is just the beginning. The difference in strength between the two is so disparate that the magical battle situation is overwhelming and Kim has no chance to fight back. The strength that Brett gets from the memory crystal is much stronger than the gold that is practiced on the normal way. The magic level of both sides is not at the same level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold clearly feels that the elves are gathering quickly around Bright, and he immediately speculates that the next magic is unstoppable, and even if it blocks What is it used for? Is there another one? He knew that Bright had to kill himself, although he didn't know why Bright did it, but when he first met Blett, he read the deep killing from the other's eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
