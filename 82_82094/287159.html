			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guines Palace, almost in the Yaoyang room with the Queen’s palace, Su Ge, who had just showered, lay on a white, soft bed and felt like lying Like on the clouds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a state-level treatment, this decoration, I can’t dream of dreaming.” Su Ge looked at the white ceiling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Yaoyang room is very large, with a total area of ​​about 400 pings, bedroom, bathroom, cloakroom, living room, bathroom, study, balcony, sports room, etc. Everything is available. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is even a 70-flat hot spring bath where Su Ge has just been lying and playing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turned to look at the latest style wall clock on the wall, just eight o'clock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a little early to sleep at this time." Su Ge thought about sitting up and down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carpet on the ground is woven from the top silver yak, with bare feet, smooth and soft, like stepping on cotton, but personal A very solid feeling, can't tell the comfort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wearing a black gold silk robe, Su Ge eyes looked up and looked around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire bedroom is at least fifty square meters. It is a delicate and simple style. There is not much, but it looks very high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most shocking thing is that this room lighting is not kerosene or gas, but electric lights! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the real electric lights, even the beautiful lampshade, and the same bedside switch that controls these lights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The royal family is ultimately a royal family, even if it is a small country, it is not to be underestimated. Electric lights are the top luxury goods for the current society. Conceptual products produced. The cost of this set should be unimaginable.” Su Ge looked at the light bulb on the wall and sighed in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood here and he didn’t run around. After he came in from the morning, he had already visited here, and there is no need to go see it again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go out of the bedroom and open the study door through the living room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just in the moment of opening the door, Su Ge’s instinctive inspiration suddenly flashed a warning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This warning is not too intense, as if telling Su Ge not to forget something important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For this kind of inspiration similar to the sixth sense, Su Ge has always believed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then carefully close the door again, open the vision, and release the sound waves of the night bell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door of the study opens silently again, but this time Suge clearly feels At the moment when the door opened, there was a thing that was unclear and unclear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This thing does not know what it is, and does not know what it looks like, even he can't see it, can't hear it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he did feel that there was something in the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Isn't enough vision?" Su Ge looked at his own vision, 29 points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is only a few months, it has risen more than 20 points. This is too fast." Seeing their own vision, Su The heart is gloomy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lingshi is a double-edged sword, and Ron is a good example. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more you see, the more you know, and you have to take on more risks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s not a way to grow up. Don’t you know if there is any change in the growth that avoids the vision, or is it a way to reduce the vision?” Suddenly whimsical thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second he returned to God and felt the external situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aftermath of the evening clock is the aftermath of the spirit and the spirit of Su Ge, which has excellent crossover and extensibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the aftermath has spread to the outside of the house, including the corridor outside the door, the flower beds outside the window, and even the bedroom of Vanas, with a radius of about 50 meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifty meters is now the limit of Suger perception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close your eyes, in this aftermath Su Ge can see the outside guards, the soldiers walking back and forth patrolling the corridor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people can’t look like they can only see the approximate shape, just like the sketched characters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The will slowly let go, Su Ge found Vanas in his room at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is lying on her bed at this time, her body stretches into a strange bow, her head and feet are supported, and her back is completely out of the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's the matter!?" Seeing Vanas's look, Sugueton was shocked and hurriedly mobilized all his energy for high-precision observation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today’s Vanas has an extraordinary meaning for him. According to his development ideas, the future Guinness Kingdom will be the home base of the Church of the Late Bells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the concentration of the spirit, the blurred form is clearer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge brows tightly: "What is she doing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time he can be blurred Seeing Vanas's hand on the lower part of his lower abdomen, the other hand licked his chest and kept groaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Does she have a heart attack? Is the body in a state of paralysis now?" Su Ge was shocked and hurriedly walked toward the south wall of the room. Close to some, if the distance is close enough, Su Ge can even sense her heartbeat through the bell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go to the corner of the room closest to the palace, Su Ge once again released the night bell, carefully observed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pump! thump! Plop...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distance is about 30 meters today, and Su Ge clearly heard a rush of heartbeat through the vibration of the aftermath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Vanas's body suddenly froze, and the body seemed to be constantly shaking and twitching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why is it so painful, the body trembles like this? Should I inform the guard?" Su Ge had some tangles in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am now voyeuristic, what should I tell others? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While not to mention, Vanas is still dangerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Suge struggled, Vanas’s body suddenly fell back to the bed from that strange angle, and the rushing heartbeat gradually returned to calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems to be coming over." Su Ge breathed a sigh of relief. After about five minutes, Su Ge felt that Vanas stood up from the bed with a steady breath and went out of the bath after taking a bath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge opened his eyes here: "The symptoms of this sputum should be caused by irregular work and long-term rest, and even the ability to die." This matter is solved, Vanas is very important to me, can not let her body be dragged down by the war."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think of this, Su Ge deep Take a breath: "It seems to be able to come up with some real skills."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Suge decided to use the full-enhanced analysis mode to deal with this matter, quick fix . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other side, Vanas, lying in the bath, is ruddy and refreshed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pressure of so many days has all vented out in the thrill of that moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Pope is really my savior." Vanas closed her eyes and thought about her own bold illusions about the Pope's ambitions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your Majesty, there is an emergency in front, there seems to be a small plague in the outer city, and all the residents infected by the plague have become a werewolf!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Vanas reminisced, Maria’s anxious voice suddenly came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
