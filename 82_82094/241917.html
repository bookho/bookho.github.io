			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After determining the determination of Su Ge, Emilia first let Su Ge retreat to make some corresponding preparations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Su Ge left, Emilia turned to look around the ten people and asked: "How?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We think it's okay." The five bishops took the lead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogan followed and said seriously: "Sug will not let you down, Archbishop."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Emilia nodded with satisfaction, and immediately said: "Then, we will focus on what person He is! The Lord of Death and Storm, the only true God of the Valley and the Abyss, is He a God? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of the battle, everyone did not have any concealment, truthfully speaking, and the core of the problem was pushed to the mysterious person called Luke . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just just mentioned that he helped the mysterious masks to prepare to summon the tactics to fight the monsters, and then according to the situation at the time, the rules inside the statutes because The fall of the foreigner (the dark son) was destroyed, and it is certain that he could not come to the material world through conventional means. Due to the destruction of the rules, the goddess’ visual protection system failed, and it is very likely that “the gods cannot The rules of direct vision will also be time-sensitive. From the current conditions, we cannot judge whether or not he is a god. According to the records, the existence of certain %@#% can also reach this level." Five bishops, The youngest blue-haired youth in their thirties is seriously analyzing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged bishop nodded and said: "Eric said it makes sense."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogan Here, I have taken the message and said: "Although we are temporarily unable to determine which form He is, at least from now on, they are not our enemies. According to Luke’s dialogue with them at the time, they seem to be constantly on the mainland. Going on, dealing with some major things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't quite agree with Bishop Rogan." The woman bishop said calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bishop Salo, telling your doubts." Emilia turned her head and looked at her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishop Saro seriously said his suspicions: "First of all, they are too abrupt. There are no records in our records that are related to them. They are like a sudden appearance. In addition, they have helped us to deal with this time. The incident, but they took away all the powerful remnants, and even Ron’s magic book was taken away. We can suspect that they are collecting some powerful remnants.”<br /><br />&nbsp "Third, since at dusk, the rules inside the statute are broken. If they want to stop, why not call them in advance? Are they waiting in the dark, waiting for Ron to finish?" Summon to achieve some of their purposes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Finally, the people who help us destroy the enemy do not mean that we are friends, or they may be hidden in A new enemy in the dark. This cult is intertwined and the cases of killing each other have appeared too much in history."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishop of Salo listened, others nodded at the same time Express approval. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if Rogan, the three people who know the truth, feel that these four doubts are very impressive and convincing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emilia nodded and affirmed: "It’s very good, Bishop Salo, this is really worth our attention."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For this matter, I think the next step should be focused on three parts." The middle-aged bishop put forward his own ideas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please say, Bishop Kirian."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bishop Kirien echoed: " First and foremost, that is, we need to determine what their true intentions are, they should not stop here, we should set up a special team to track this matter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, it makes sense."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Second, I think we have to determine what kind of existence He is. In the last few thousand In the long years of the year, the ancient races have not escaped from the world, and all kinds of gods that are very active in mythology are no longer appearing. It seems that because of certain problems, they are unable to set foot on the material world. I want to think more about his appearance. Possibility, He is the ancient god of “getting out of the trap”, or a new god formed in recent years, or a powerful existence that has come into contact with the source knowledge. Their appearance gives us a wake up, the world Although it looks very calm, it is quietly happening that we can’t perceive. . & Nbsp;; & nbsp; & nbsp change "<br <br /> & nbsp />;When you hear this, everyone has a glimpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the establishment of the system in March, people have lived relatively quiet for seven or eight thousand years, and people instinct already believe that the world will not change much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Third, according to historical records, every time the arrival of "outsiders" will have a hidden and invisible influence on the world, this time will not be an exception. The mysterious trajectory is like an incomparably dense spiderweb covering the whole world. Any node twitching will involve a chain reaction beyond our imagination. We must be prepared in advance to deal with any mysterious situation."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fourth: I think everyone has noticed that his powers include frost and bells. According to The Apocalypse of the Mist, these two are quite different. There are two legendary gods that symbolize ancient times."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The mysterious cold king of the six kings of the undead in ancient times, and the suppression of the abyss, mastered The clock in the valley of the Hades." Emilia muttered to herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When this is mentioned, everyone is in silence, and the history records are too vague. Because they are recorded through human perspectives, they can only know some vague abilities and probably name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But it is also that period of history that ended the distorted era of ancient times and entered a mysterious era suitable for human development. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What else do you want to say?" The atmosphere was heavy for about a minute, and Emilia asked around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five bishops shook their heads and said that they had finished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bishop Rogan?" Emilia turned to look at Logan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogan smiled bitterly: "I can't think of anything else. I was just tortured by Ron's men, and the whole process was stupid."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emilia nodded with deep sympathy and said: "The church will remember your courage and dedication."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I met Luke later." Suddenly, the author of the wheelchair, the old and frustrated Father Waterer spoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
