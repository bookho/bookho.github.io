			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Sugg looked at the notebook, Lance walked out of the back room with a box. He could see it and he relaxed a lot. It should have been determined. Still inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is things found?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lance nodded silently, looking down at the assassin’s body, and said sadly: “I just didn’t expect to pay such a huge price.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge passed the notebook and said: "They died and they did not leave regrets."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lan Si looked down and carefully placed the notebook in his arms and took a deep breath and said: "I hope that their souls will be redeemed. When I return to the headquarters, I will let the sacrifices pray and bless for their spirits. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge closed his eyes and perceived: "Their souls have been redeemed in the self-fulfillment."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You...can you feel it?" Lance heard a curiosity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled: "My mysterious profession is a priest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lance I heard it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two did not deal with the bodies of the three people. After all, in the case of two people, there was no way to deal with the bodies that were completely scattered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This place will be handled by people afterwards, you don't have to worry too much." Walking on the road, Su Ge said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lance was very grateful and said with apologetic expression on his face: "I am sorry, if I am not carrying the orders and promises to transport the holy things back to the headquarters, I am very willing Help you to investigate the situation of the factory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug shakes his head and looks at the box in his hand and asks: "If you really want to repay me If I want to see what the Grail document is, I have heard it several times before, but I have not seen it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lance indulged and agreed to nod: "No problem, anyway, the shape of the Grail document is various, this is not a secret."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge followed Lance to his residence, a neat and quiet high-end hotel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sitting in the living room, Lance opened the box in his hand, in which Sug saw a human hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This palm is white, the fingers are slender, the skin is smooth and delicate, full of elasticity, it should be a woman's hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The palm is cut off from the wrist, the cross section is very neat, and even the wound above has healed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the box was opened, the palm that had just calmed suddenly jumped up, and the five fingers opened, like a strange larva, rushing toward Su Ge’s face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lance missed a few spells at this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately, the open five fingers gradually gathered, then floated in the air and returned to Lance's shoulder, as if a small animal squatted on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug saw the surprise of this face, tempted to ask: "This is the Holy Grail document?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, the origins and conditions of each holy grail document are different. This holy grail document is a sage-level druid in our elf sect, and in a battle out, it was in contact. What is unknown and thus produces variation. This hand has self-awareness, although the form is still a hand, but its internal structure has completely become another kind of creature. Fortunately, its will is not the kind of evil chaos, it I miss her master very much, and I am very close to the people who have the spirits in our body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge carefully looked at this hand and asked in confusion: "I remember that your Elf Order is located on the archipelago on the northwest side of the continent. How can this thing come here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lance sighed a sad explanation: "That was a thing of the past time, we tried to be in the northern kingdom. After teaching, I needed some magical things to show miracles. So I sent the palm of my hand, and in the process of returning from use, I encountered a great battle of the army, and the escorts were all killed by the sudden fire." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a tragedy." Su Ge sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The sacred Grail document is the key to finding the Holy Grail. Are you sending out such important things, is it too sloppy?" Su Ge asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lance re-puts the palm into the box and says: "In fact, this thing is not as great as you think. The rumor has been inherited from ancient times. Seven Holy Grail."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Seven!?" Su Ge had some surprises. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought it was one, or two or three. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lance nodded: "These seven holy grails have changed hands in countless years and left traces in various parts of the world. People don't know what the holy grail represents. I don't know how they differ from each other. Even the traces left behind are likely to be decades or even thousands of years, and there is hardly any practical value. From this holy grail document, we have studied For decades, I don’t know what kind of knowledge it represents, and because of what kind of knowledge makes it like this, and I don’t know how it relates to anything.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For example, it’s like I’m looking for an ancient location. And I did find some traces, these traces are just the footprints of some ancient people, or the stones thrown by the ancients, or The ancients broke the branches of the hand. These things may have been left by the ancients decades ago, or perhaps hundreds of years ago. It is only the traces left by the ancients, the position of the ancients, and the people of the ancients. There is any relationship. It is unrealistic to find the location of the ancients through a footstep by the ancients."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And these traces are not one person, or seven Personal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to this, Su Ge had some clear concepts about the Grail document. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now, most of the Holy Grail documents are used as secret treasures for mysterious people to use, and even some people use the Holy Grail documents as materials to make powerful mysterious costumes." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge nodded and looked at the palm and asked: "What is the power of this palm?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
