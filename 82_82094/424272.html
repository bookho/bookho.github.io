			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out from here, just to see Roland is playing a Kunte card with a person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She seems to be very skilled and easy to take the other side down and take away the one hand in the other hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she saw Su Ge coming out, she closed the card and asked, "How is the situation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "The harvest is good, let's go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland nodded and greeted the few people and said hello. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the pub, it’s already half past ten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's the harvest on your side?" On the road, Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland’s easy answer: “There are some things that are not nutritious. Some people say that there is a treasure here. Some people say that there is a holy grail document, and some people say it here. What kind of ceremony was held?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge asked: "What else are you going to do next?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rolanden said: "Jack found a case involving mystery, let me help. If you are fine here, I will go straight."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go, be careful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Subsequently, the two separated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is sitting here on the church to distribute a special carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go to Yujin Street, Avon House."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At eleven o'clock, the Avon family sent Luther three people out of the house with enthusiasm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Avon's parents were very happy during the morning conversation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After conversation, Evan is not only getting the opportunity to continue his studies, but also the guidance of the best professors, as well as generous scholarships. Even the research results of his son’s robbed are likely to come back, and even if they don’t come back, they can get a very rich money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This result has gone far beyond the imagination of this simple worker couple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luther also secretly sighed and looked happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is now comforting Evan and showing enough sincerity. How much can calm some of the bishop's anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that, he has time to discuss with his master about how to deal with this matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just down the stairs, Luther took a hat and turned his head, just to see a man wearing a black suit, with a silk topper, holding a cane A low-key, stately black carriage went down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He swept his eyes and he saw the sign of the Church of the Holy Blood on this carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turning to look at the youth, an invisible sense of oppression comes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This..." Luther laughed halfway and his face was completely frozen, his face paled again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The side of Evan accidentally walked over and asked: "Sogo, how come you? I thought you would be very busy today."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled: "It’s really busy, so you need to come over and help me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp After that, the smile on his face gradually converges, and he looks at the pale-faced Luther. "Isn't this the grandmother of my alma mater? How come you like this big man?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, Luther’s sly screamed a cold sweat and hurried forward to the ceremony: “The believers have seen Bishop Sotos, and the glory of the goddess will always shine on you. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge nodded slightly and asked, "Is Nya Tesla arrived?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luther listened to the heart and slammed, the sweat of the beans went down the cheek Leaving, the body's deeper answer: "Last night, I was resting in the university apartment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug turned to Evan and said: "Let's go, take me to school to see, I haven't come back for a long time, and some can't remember the road."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I will change clothes first." Evan nodded happily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just turned around, Evan curiously asked: "Who is this Niya Tesla?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Luther just wanted to explain, but he heard Su Ge say freely: "My friend's student."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Luther’s legs suddenly shook and almost slammed on the floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, the last trace of luck in the heart was completely destroyed by Su Ge. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought that after apprehending Evan, through the operation of the road family and the steam guild, after giving enough profits to Evan, the invention rights could be retained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if you wait for Soge to return to Guinness, then clean up Evan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, he finds that Su Ge’s power is far beyond his imagination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is Niya Tesla? It is a genius mechanical expert who is well-known in the circle. At a young age, he has become the inspection minister. He holds the invention patent of twelve, and is called the electric queen, the pioneer of the future electrical revolution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the existence of the teacher, who is actually a good friend of the bishop! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, he regrets, feeling that he is particularly naive, naive thinking that the authority of this foreign bishop is no different, naive thinking that strong dragon pressure But the head snake...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sluggishness, Su Ge’s voice was stunned, and the smiling and Evan’s parents and Betty said this, and the three people on the side were completely dry there, as if they didn’t see it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After five minutes, I changed my new suit and the energetic Evan came out and said, "Go!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then two people sat in the carriage of Su Ge and left quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Su Ge left completely, Evan’s parents reminded: “Mr. President, the bishop has already left.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luther was awake as a dream, raised his head and rubbed his eyes, and looked around and felt a little unreal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. President?" Betty strongly smiled and reminded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luther returned to God, with a stiff smile on his face, and went to the carriage and disappeared into the family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s really deflated!" Betty clenched her fists, and her face was full of excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parents are also full of smiles on their faces, a radiant look, and a feeling of exultation makes them feel refreshed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking on the quiet road of Bain University, surrounded by falling leaves, with sunny weather, autumn is refreshing, making people feel comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan is in a very happy mood at this time. He hasn’t been to school for two months, because his school’s original school knows that he has become all People's jokes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He loves his face and naturally has no face to go back to school. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this time he came back differently, he raised his head at this time, his waist standing straight, his face confident and full of vigor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bypassed student saw Evan, the shame of the former school, with a hint of smirk, very disdainful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The masses are not capable of recognizing the truth, they will only follow their own moral standards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Su Ge had a hat and the hat was a little big. Others did not notice that the portrait of this person was hanging on the wall of the main hall of the school. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remember that the last time we walked this way was almost a year and a half ago, when you were publicly rejected by Mary, I am guiding you." With a trace of remembrance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it was graduating, Su Ge refused to confess in the back of the prom, and was also a clown by the nobility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When everyone laughed at himself, Evan was with him, guiding him and planning a new way for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled: "Well, life, always filled with the ups and downs of the ups and downs. I was not worried when I was dreaming." There is still a chance to return to this place with this attitude."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I really thank you this time, otherwise I will be a lifetime clown, all the school The object of the student's ridicule." Evan sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge stretched out his hand and hugged his shoulder: "Don’t endless, the true friendship between the brothers will not change with time and status. And when things change, your comfort and encouragement to me that night, I will remember for a lifetime."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Avon listened to the incomparable warmth of his heart, holding back Su The shoulder of the grid: "I know, I will not look at the wrong person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the emotion, two people followed the road through the four teaching buildings, Come to the apartment on the west side of the school. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These apartments are all specially prepared for students who have rich people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interior is very well decorated, one bedroom, one living room and one bathroom, with an area of ​​about sixty square meters, comparable to the configuration of some high-end apartments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The price is also in place, 15 francs a month. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This month’s rent is equivalent to Avon’s father’s salary for one month. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several detached apartment villas on the south side of the apartment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This villa is not external, it is used to greet the officials and guests who came to visit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, who is this Niya Tesla? Listening to the name is a bit familiar." Evan asked again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge casually said: "She is a steam unionist and is the examiner for this quota."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh! I remembered it!" Evan's eyes lit up at this moment, and then unexpectedly asked: "She is your friend's student!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, forget it. But don't get me wrong, my friend is not her mechanical teacher, but other aspects." Su Ge explained in advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan listened to the darkness and gave the electric queen a master, which is at least the master of mechanical mechanics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a regular profession, the rank of the master is the limit of this profession, and the master of mechanics represents the supreme existence of this industry, which is rare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Su Ge knows the characters at that level, then Su Ge’s connections are a bit too bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger looked around and asked: "This is a rich area, should there be a lot of rich students?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Avon nodded: "Yes, we didn't envy this place at the beginning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mike Road lives here? Here Is there his fox friend?" Su Ge asked in succession. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After mentioning him, Evan clenched his fist and said, "Yes, there is over there. His group of friends and friends are also there."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's weird." Su Ge brows slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong?" Evan asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge touched his chin and said, "Let's walk this way, many students have recognized you. They have been away for such a long time, how come there are few A self-righteous, unopened guy who came to provoke you? I also thought about smashing the machine and smashing the face, so I can clean up the guys."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
