			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge doesn’t know how long it has been, and wakes up again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He feels better at this time, at least the head is not so painful, and the blisters and ulcers in his mouth have improved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slightly turned to look to the left, the bottle is still hanging there, but the liquid inside has changed from the dark red to the current emerald green. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This stuff goes in along with the blood vessels, is it sure that you are not going to kill me?" The thoughts have recovered a lot, and Su Ge’s heart spits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tucao is a spit, and he doesn’t have the ability to stop this thing from flowing into his own blood vessels now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a little recovery in the head, but the control of the body is still not enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don’t worry, after the bottle is imported, I promise you will be fully healthy within two days." The familiar voice came, then It is the kind face of Father Hank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This...is...he..." Sug barely opened the lips of the frustrated, unpredictable, fuzzy. Father Hank hurriedly organized and said with a smile: "Your heroic deeds have been affirmed by the church, and the generous and kindly Ron Bishop has licensed me to use the Griffin." The blood is for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said, he pointed to the blood bottle and said: "This is a lion blood as the main body, mixed with tiger blood, The blood of the male goat, and the fine blood bottle of a small amount of cow blood. Not only does he have enough nutrients to nourish your body, but it can also improve your physical fitness and make you stronger after recovery."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge slightly nodded in the heart: "The lion's blood is quite a bit of a force, what is the ghost of the male goat's blood and the cow's blood after that? You give me a test What is the blood type?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the process of vomiting, Su Ge’s thinking is becoming more and more active, and the memory of the previous fault is gradually recovering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh! I remembered it. I drank the shark potion and overtook the last soul, and after a simple return, I fainted." I thought of the cause of the matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This potion is really terrible. Master Geros also said that this potion is low in toxicity. Are we really talking about one thing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;汉This is not to know that Su Ge’s mind is thinking about these messy things, and telling the news he had heard before, letting the patient feel better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your pay is worth it. Bishops Gerlos and Ron have decided to go down. After your two-month internship, you can go straight. Join the Church of the Holy Blood and become a formal cleric. The bishop and Master Geros pay great attention to you, don't let them down!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded, Excited in my heart: "Value! These pains are really worth it! I have a strong analytical ability, as long as I walk into the library, I will fly to the sky!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Okay, you continue to sleep. This bottle of high-grade blood bottle will have a very obvious effect. When you wake up again, you can almost get out of bed." Hank said, giving Su Finish the cup on the body, drop the bed and turn and leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the spirit of Su Ge has not fully recovered. After the excitement, he completely disappeared. When his eyes closed, he slept. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Su Ge did not completely faint, but did not return to the ice warship, he felt his consciousness in a dark space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been a lot of warm and powerful energy around, which has penetrated from all directions to nourish everything here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gradually, under the nourishment of these forces, Su Ge felt that he was very powerful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very excited, excited and even a bit arrogant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When this tremendous power reaches its peak, he is eager to vent and release this power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to attack, wants to attack anything he sees, wants to kill other existence, prove his power...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he seemed to be crazy, and began to scream like crazy, like a beast without saga. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long bell suddenly remembered, Su Ge’s picture turned and felt I returned to the throne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the moment when Su Ge opened his eyes, suddenly a bloody red shadow flashed past the eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Call! What is that!" Looking at the temple, Su Ge had a lingering fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red shadow that just flashed past was terrifying, he was completely irrational, and some had only the most primitive chaos and frenzy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In its eyes, there is only destruction and killing, irrational. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What the hell is that?" Su Ge thought as he looked down at his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vision of the gods once again resolves his body, and this corresponds to the changes in the body of the present world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, it can be seen that a lot of emerald green energy is slowly penetrating all over his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These energies, although mixed with a lot of energy, are very gentle and warm, they nourish the whole body of Su Ge, let the damaged tissues and nerves recover quickly, let The weak body becomes strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this Su Ge is very satisfied, because these strange blood mixed together did not send themselves to the West, indeed has a real magical effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have to say that this method of blood therapy is really amazing." Su Ge then combined with the memory in his mind, sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original Soge Sotos knew about blood therapy, but this method is very expensive because it works very well, generally only those rich aristocrats And formal clergy are eligible to use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and blood therapy has also spawned many other by-products, the most famous of which are two, one is the magic pottery of the demon, the second is the blood liqueur. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
