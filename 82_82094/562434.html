			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before going to the temple, Su Ge stretched out his hand on the rock, and the vibration of the fine lines was transmitted to the stone through the palm of his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, all the scenery in the fan-shaped area with a radius of 100 meters in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only the construction of stones, but also many subtle things, such as plants, insects, etc., have not been let go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a year and a half, although I have been running, mysterious learning and devotion have not fallen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nowadays, no matter in the precision, strength, or knowledge and mastery of various knowledge, he is no longer comparable to the previous one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the ruins about 50 meters away from us, in the middle of the entire temple, there is a downward wellhead. There is a diagonal down the wellhead. The tunnel is about 30 meters below the ground. There is a tomb in the ground in front."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley listened to the light jump on the stone Road: "Think about it, go quickly. I have sweated in the past few days. I don't want to live outside today. I want to live in a hotel. I want to take a hot spring."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp These two days have been looking for in this inaccessible deep forest. I haven't seen other people for five days, let alone a decent place to live. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly, and the psionic energy was emitted. First, use basic intensification to strengthen the legs, and then accumulate kinetic energy through vibration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a second, Su Ge jumped, provoked five meters high and steadily stood on the stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go!" said, the two people are brisk, like two dexterous elves who are advancing rapidly on the big rock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For more than a year, Su Ge has done a lot of other aspects of learning and reinforcement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more important thing is the physical exercise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His physical weakness is not the first time he has exposed problems, especially after he has encountered Shirley, making Su Ge's physical strengthening more urgent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he learned a lot of skills in Gerlos, Su Ge began to pay attention to his physical problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After determining the direction, Su Ge got a set of basic fitness and fighting techniques from fighting for Jackos to exercise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuous exercise is one aspect, on the other hand, naturally, the two are constantly running and taking risks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuously in various dangers, the tombs look for clues to explore, which is very burdensome for the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long distance running, rock climbing, swimming, diving, climbing trees, and many other extreme sports, for two people can be said to be commonplace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning, Sug’s flight with a black cloak was better than avoiding it, but Shirley seemed to like this thrilling extreme sport. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time you experience it yourself, it’s fun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this kind of sport, Shirley naturally does not play by himself, definitely want to pull the Soviet Union into the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Shirley's verbal stimuli, especially after satirizing Su Ge's body and kidney deficiency, Su Ge's violent temper also broke out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consequence of a small temper is that Suge played more than Shelly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From about a year ago, most of the places where Sug went were dangerous places. Wherever two people go, it can be said where they are going, where is it? I will be killed if I am a little careless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sochi’s physical strength and coordination have been greatly improved over time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be able to see it, Su Ge’s current body is stronger than before, and he still becomes a fitness man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, it’s not just Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sherry's perfect body is also more bodybuilding and health. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If her body was a natural worldly jade, then this jade is now engraved by the world’s best engraver, more The fireworks are more hot and tempting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When advancing, Su Ge looked at Shirley’s white arm and asked, “How can you not get black?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A year and a half of the wind and the sun, actually did not leave any traces on Shirley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with her, Su Ge, before the white complexion has been sun-dried with some brownish yellow, the skin is also relatively rough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Su Ge’s clean chin was full of scorpions and looked like a middle-aged uncle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl said with a bit of sarcasm: "Do you really think that the blood of the god is waste?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "And, this body has been strengthened and reorganized through my previous powers. Although it is human, its function has already exceeded the human form."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Su Ge is also very envious when he agrees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amazing touch of Shirley's body has been felt countless times, not the normal human skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, her body can be said to be invulnerable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug remembered that about two months ago, when two people passed through a war-torn country, Shirley’s arm was hit by a stray bullet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gave Sug a big jump, then found that Shirley’s blood did not stay, and even left no trace on the white arm. It just hurts a bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the cold gaze of Shelly, Sug rushed out to kill the soldier who had shot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very clear that if Shirley takes a shot, it is not a matter of killing a person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For her, there is no difference between killing a person and stepping on a bug. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it here?" Shelly asked as she looked at a large stone that looked very ordinary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This stone is very common, not prominent, with some fungi and green moss on it, the shape is ordinary, the appearance is ordinary, and the position is very common. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge released the night bell and probed again and said: "This is the place where the big stone is removed, the ceiling of the entire temple below, under the ceiling. A secret passage that was sealed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley nodded slightly, lifting his hand with mountaineering gloves on the two-meter-high rock. Push it at once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a bang, it seems that at least half a ton of stone is flying like a stone a few meters away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this scene, Su Ge’s heart slammed and asked, “How is your energy recovered?”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shelly said casually: "According to your human evaluation, it should be a master."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's pretty fast. Su Ge has a slight heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley fell from a higher form and possessed a lot of powerful knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but her own energy belongs to the astral world and is not suitable for the psionic system here, so it is necessary to slowly convert its own energy into human beings. The psionic power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two men count as two extremes, and Su Ge’s knowledge is not much, but the psionics are scary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Shirley’s knowledge is scary, but the psionics are less pitiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Suger's induction, Shirley's current level of psionics is also expert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why she said the master herself is that if she breaks out all the psionic powers, she can use the same means as the master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the result is that the spirit is dry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just like this, it’s the embodiment of the master of knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stone was blown out, and Sug looked down and suddenly smelled a musty smell of corruption. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people skillfully brought a gas mask and looked at the completely rotten roof below. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This roof is covered with bricks and wood as a stand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wood is now corrupt, and the dusty bricks are scattered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The location of the two stations is not high from the ground, about four meters high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge once again used the night bell to confirm, saying: "There is no weathering and traps on the ground, and there is no poison."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, I took the lead to jump. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feet landed, and suddenly brought a lot of dust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One more sound, the bigger the dust rises, like a gray-black fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I really want to take a shower now." Shyly under the mask muttered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled and took her down the ruins and found that it seemed to be intentional, with a relatively large space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turned around, Su Ge raised his hands, a violent vibration and psionic cohesion on his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, push your hands forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like a wall of air with great power pushed by Su Ge, only to see the shabby bricks, dust, stones, sculptures on the ground. Every moment was pushed aside, and the whole ground was level and clean, just like the machine that had just been cleaned up and cleaned up all the garbage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rubbish was pushed away, and Sug patted the dust on the gloves and walked to where the two had just stood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the debris on the surface of the earth was emptied, and a tightly locked stone door appeared on the stone paved floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge arbitrarily raised his hand, and a very sharp sharp edge was cut over it, chopping the lock directly, then lifting the foot down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗡! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The violent vibration flashed past, and the stone door has been shattered and dropped, revealing the steps leading down to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s attitude is easy to go down and say casually: “Look at how easy it is to rob the tomb, I really don’t understand how those people dare without two brushes. Going to the cemetery for adventure? After being chased by monster worms, take the life of the companion to try the trap. Hey, don't take the porcelain work without the diamond."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shelley has become accustomed to Suge sometimes saying something she can't understand, while walking and saying, "I want to eat barbecue today."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, as long as we go out, I will take you there." Su Ge took out a kerosene lantern from his backpack and said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have to take a bath, I have to change into new clothes, I have to listen to musicals." Shirley continued. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge nodded constantly, took out his notebook and looked at the records inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "According to Jones, this tomb is the second dynasty, the Sofia dynasty, but from this structure and configuration, it is not very similar." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evening bell was released continuously, and Su Ge found that the overall structure of the tomb was completely different from the structure of the tomb of the Sofia Dynasty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Sowaya dynasty popularly uses a double cemetery, and there are four huge columns around it, symbolizing the four basic elements of the world, but this The cemetery is on the first floor, and there are many golden sands around. The most important thing..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, two people stopped and looked up through the light. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
