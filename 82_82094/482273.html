			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, Su Ge just woke up to wash, and heard a rush of knocking on the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open the door and see Griffin standing at the door and say, "The bishop, the church came to order the messenger."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Suger arranged the collar of the white shirt and asked: "The messenger?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Griffin's face is focused on the head: "There is a bad person." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge's mouth tilted slightly: "Know it, let him wait, I will come soon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; After combing the body makeup, Su Ge nodded with satisfaction and walked out of the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unconsciously, he found that he is paying more and more attention to his grooming, and more and more... Love is smug. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the corridor of the church, the Griffin is wearing two silver-gray robes with a reddish blood crest on the chest. people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the unique costume of the Holy Blood Church ambassador. The news brought by this attire is usually the central court, or the important order that the pope personally came down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two messengers all seem to be in their thirties, one tall and one short, each carrying a box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden hair combing, eyebrows are carefully trimmed, sitting there straight, a look of pride, facing the side of Griffin Drinking tea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge came in and said with a smile: "The two messengers come overnight, afraid that there is something important to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tall messenger has a lot of Su Ge: "You are the regional bishop here, Su Ge Sotos?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge Head, take out your own bishop token. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The short messenger took it over and looked carefully. After confirming that it was correct, he said: "The central hospital has an urgent order to entrust Bishop Sotos."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saying, the tall messenger opened his own box and took out a black long tube made of special ceramic from inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This long tube looks like a single piece with a special texture on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's actually a black tube!" Griffin was a little moved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The church's orders are divided into five according to their priorities. From low to high, they are: white, yellow, purple, black, and red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The material of the transmission tube is also different. This black transmission tube has been specially treated. The above texture is passed by the master-level clerk and customized according to the token of the transmission target. Rune. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the corresponding rune fluctuations on the token can be used to open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the violence is turned on, the black tube will explode directly, and the power of the explosion is equivalent to three grenades. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge himself is naturally aware of the rules of this. After receiving the order, he holds the inside of the token against the end of the pump. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver-gray lines above flashed a glimmer of light, and the bamboo tube suddenly broke open from the middle, with a very thick dark yellow parchment inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put open the ink on the top and see the contents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goddess shines, sheltering all beings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the church survey, the ancient city of Aya, which has been in the misty mountains for 80 years, has reappeared, causing the vibration of the mysterious world and the mutationalization of innocent people. In this special case, Bishop Sog Sotos led his men, immediately opened, rushed to the Misty Mountains, rushed to investigate the cause of the incident before other organizations, and joined the joint investigators to deal with the variation of the ancient city and bring back the variation for the church. Source, may the glory of the goddess illuminate the path you are going. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The book of the Church of the Holy Blood Church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After reading the instructions, Su Ge asked: "Is there any other instructions?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The short messenger responded: "Because of the sudden incident, the Bishop Sotos was allowed to advance to stabilize the situation and declare the existence of the church. After that, the reinforcements of the church will soon arrive, and the Bishop Sotos will not be used. Worried."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tall messenger nodded, a sacred radiance: "The goddess will not give up any of his people."<br /><舒 />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug said that he was very touched and said with a look of sincerity and happiness: "Thanks to the goddess for the protection, thank the church for trusting me. Please ask the two messengers to convey to the church, even if they lose Life, I will not let the goddess and the church be ashamed!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the sincere look of Su Ge at this time, the two messengers are very satisfied, and at the same time blessing Dao: "The glory of the goddess is with you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the order was completed, Su Ge said: "I must be very tired all the way, Griffin, please two The messenger moves to the VIP area to rest well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Griffin listened and smiled and said: Please!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tall young man waved his hand and refused: "Thank you for the good intentions of the bishop, but this is very urgent. I need to resolve the bishop’s determination as soon as possible. Dearly report upwards, there can be no delay, please understand the bishop."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge did not continue to retain, and looked sorry: "That's a pity." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After the return of Bishop Sotos, I hope that the bishops will be more than one!" The young man smiled and flattered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Must! Certain!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Send the messenger, Su Ge’s eyes with a hint of drama : "Hunting, the oriole is behind. Since you like to make the oriole, you have to see clearly, whether it is a scorpion, or a hunter!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp Afterwards, Su Ge did not have any delays. He immediately called Hills and Alger: "Take us, give you four hours to prepare, go north in the afternoon, and go to the Misty Mountains." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hills immediately nodded: "Yes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger Gray’s eyes were somewhat apathetic and asked: “How many people do you need to bring?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s sinking: “Since there are follow-up reinforcements of the church, we As long as you show your position, you don't have to bring too many people, and you are all elite."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger nodded "I have taught a group of subordinates recently, as blood The trainees of the month are now small and fruitful. There are six people, and this time they are all taken."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the best, you are going to prepare I went to the Imperial Palace to talk about this. When I was away, the church was completely responsible for the matter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Follow!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Suge went to the Royal Palace, two high-and-one dwarf messengers had already met Laurie and the Dark Star. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You performed very well." The whole process was under the supervision of Laurie, and he said to the two messengers with satisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thanks to the Archbishop for his praise." The two men humbly thanked them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Laurie said: "The two can go back to prepare for the expeditionary army, I will follow them to continue north. I will inform you when necessary, the follow-up troops can Directly appear, take Su Ge to the ground."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understand!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two messengers After the walk, the corner of the dark star showed a sneer: "This kind of heresy is actually a kind of devout look. It is a disgusting appearance. He is such a person who tarnishes the glory of the goddess. I really want to marry him now." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Laurie’s hands behind him, looking at the prosperous streets outside the window, said: “Even if a pile of rubbish has its role, let alone the church spends on him. A lot of resources, of course, give the church some compensation before being arrested."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the palace, Su Ge and Vanas performed a play with a very tacit understanding. Then went to find Mill to get some potions, saying that it is used as a poison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a conversation with Elena and a quick return to the Cathedral of the Holy Blood to begin their preparations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge did not have much to prepare. He did not even need to carry mysterious materials with many means. He only brought three sets of washed suits, two black silk dome hats, and a wooden comb and a mirror. Ready. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A good lunch at noon, Su Ge only took eight people, a dog, and left in three carriages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the danger ahead, there is no even employment of the groom, and Alger’s four subordinates are part-time temporary grooms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the steep canyon of the Misty Mountains while advancing through Suger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerousus spit out a cold, long sword covered in frost drawn from the chest of a human enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not far away, Randall, who has become a prototype, wiped the blood of his mouth and restored his adult shape. He has three mysteries in his tights around him. By. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The three of me are the Nighthawk Church," Randall said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerousus’s golden guise looked at the four bodies around him: “There is a glorious church that also chills the church.”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The two churches are really weird. They are pinched together forever. I don’t know if they are the two churches." Randall’s face was boring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerousus smiled and said: "This is love and kill!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;End, look up Look at the steep mountains in front of the rocks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can see that the mountain is bare and you can't see any plants or trees except the weird purple moss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This mountain is covered by clouds from the middle of the mountain, and it is impossible to see the truth inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The fog has gradually increased by a hundred meters for five days. If this continues, the whole mountain will be completely exposed in two days." Gerlos received Start a long kendo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Randall looked at the sporadic figure of the mountain below: "The people of the three churches have found it through astrology, and there is no background mystery." The person has come, and it seems that there are some conspiracy in it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
