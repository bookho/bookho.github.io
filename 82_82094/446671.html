			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon Gwens proved to Su Ge that there is no problem with the knees of the undead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you want to drink, feel free to come to me." Su Ge said with a smile in the alley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gwens heard his eyes brightly: "That's great, we will see you at the door of the pub tomorrow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he finished, he took a deep breath and his legs bent down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sucking! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a time, the air around him was drawn into the body like a pump. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next second...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗖! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a burst of strong winds spreading around, Gwens rose up and disappeared into the sky in the blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge snorted and muttered: "What does this have to do with the knees, are you not interested in air pressure?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He clearly sees that Gewens is not jumping up, but through some kind of knowledge, using the reaction of strong pressure to push him to the sky, like a rocket that is launched . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sure enough, there is still a problem with the knees of the undead."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sogo has a good quality, so the amount of alcohol is not bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drinking so much, although a little dizzy, but I feel that thinking is like electricity, cheering and awake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How can you not be sleepy? Instead of eating stimulants?" Su Ge felt that he was very good at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, really wine is a good thing!" Su Ge smiled silly, looked up and found that he had returned to the Basilica of the Holy Blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bishop, you are..." The guard at the gatekeeper saw this suddenly unexpected accident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Su Ge’s face was reddish, his mouth was slightly raised, his eyes were a little godless, and it was obvious that he was drinking too much in a state of smirking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s back here smiled and waved his hand: “Nothing, work hard!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;When finished, the body walked into the gate with a slight shake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gwens said it is good, wine is a good thing. After drinking it can suppress rationality, release the nature, vent its own pressure, make people feel happy "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug feels an unspeakable ease and comfort at this time. The weight of the heart has just been put aside, not to care about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗝! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Returning to the room, playing a wine cellar, Su Ge sat down in a pleasant mood, holding the newly acquired "Byron Travel Manuscript" in one hand, in one hand The holy cup file, the piece of rag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come on! Look at Laozi, what is this ghost-like thing." Su Ge reached out and patted the rag, the full-fledged command. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This rag can not be violated, slowly creeping over the book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge spit out his mouth and laughed and said: "Then I did not expect that the old man had already got the Holy Grail document, and the Holy Grail is definitely My!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sugg, who was suppressed by alcohol, was happy, but began to release himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pump! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a powerful heartbeat suddenly came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge instantly converges on the form of indulgence and restores to the precise bishop of the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The sound is from the Grail document, is the heart of something transmitted, or is this the heart of the Grail document?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge thought in his heart, extending his right hand and touching the rag on the book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment of the touch, Su Ge feels and immediately enters his psionic energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately, a strange wave of volatility emerged from the Grail document, linked to Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you still want to bring me into the ancient city?" Su Ge immediately thought of the weird and distorted old dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calling...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, and the ear suddenly heard a squeaky The sound of the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After turning around, he suddenly felt his body began to fall quickly, fell from the sky, experienced the clouds, experienced the sky, experienced the mountains I have experienced the abyss...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The constant fall makes him feel very bad, but at this time it does not help, because he can not fly, he can only be eye-catching Waiting for where you can fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it is a state of soul, he does not worry that he will die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he was about to fall into the cliff, a white hand suddenly grabbed Su Ge’s clothes, and the invisible force held his body and stopped him. come down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge squinted and looked at the man who was somewhat unaware of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the edge of the cliff, a woman sits on the stone, she is wearing a pure white robe, with white and beautiful ankles, and two pushes swinging freely on the cliff . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun shines on her face, giving people an unspeakable warmth, unspeakable holiness, unspeakable brilliance, unspeakable beauty . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long, dark hair is floating in the wind, like a flying cloak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark eyes are like gems, obsidian, looking at Su Ge with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long-lost warmth and awkward voice sounded again: "Good little guy, long time no see."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;Su Ge’s instinct showed a peaceful smile: “Long time no see, kind nun.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white hand is lifted at random, as if the sister is squatting The younger brother put Su Ge by his side. She looked forward and said, "I didn't expect you to come here so soon, little guy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Suge learned that she swinged her legs a few times: "I am not too small now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is slightly sideways, her dark eyes are looking at the same dark eyes and Su Ge of the hair, relatives touched Su Ge's face: "Well, not too small."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge opened his mouth, but for a moment did not know Say what. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last time I was in a hurry, too many regrets, too many questions were not answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had thought a lot of questions, thinking about asking questions the next time he met, but he really met, but he didn’t know where to start. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A moment of silence, Su Ge asked: "Ada, what is this place?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I heard the name, Idaton smiled even more brilliantly, as if I had met the most happy thing in my life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has a red lips slightly tilted, her dark eyes looking forward: "This is the world in the book."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Byron's Travels?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well." She nodded slightly, no longer speaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huh.........<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gust of wind blew, Su Ge looked up, a sun The huge figure covering the sky flies slowly in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The past is a mess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s eyes widened and his voice was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn’t know how big the guy is covered with black scales, a rough estimate, at least five hundred meters long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How are you here?" Su Ge took his eyes and asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ada habitually reached out and held Sug’s hand on his lap and said, “The outside is a little annoying, they are always in my ear. It’s endless.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You are a witch?” Su Ge asked suddenly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ida shook his head first, then nodded with a smile, looking down at Su Ge’s hand, slightly blaming: “How long has the nail been cut? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Su Ge groaned, and in an instant he returned to the quiet and peaceful ordinary days. The gentle and beautiful big sister is entrusted to her own concerns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he returned to God, he found that his left hand nail had been cut, very neat, round and brilliance, without any burrs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ada holds his right hand in both hands, bowing his head and cutting it carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black gloves are set aside and I don’t know when I was taken off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few years ago, the most enjoyable thing for Su Ge was to lie on the side and let Ada cut his nails. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although handsome and mature, I always feel that you are as embarrassed as before." Ada said in a familiar tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge was a little embarrassed and smiled: "The nature is hard to move!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Da sighed, did not answer the bow cut seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looked at Aidana’s face and was a bit crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ada is more beautiful and more perfect than before, and it also makes Su Ge feel closer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just met her." At this time, Ada cut her nails and put down Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shirle?" Su Ge asked<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well." Ada nodded slightly: "She said that you are the hope of the world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s spirit gradually returned to normal and became rational Looked at the mountains and snowy mountains in the distance: "It is still a little early to say this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not too early."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ada smiles and looks at Su Ge: "I believe her words. Thanks to you, I can break that layer of shackles and live my own path."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge listened to the silence for a moment: "Have you seen?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ida nodded, hands held He smiled and said: "It's so handsome, it's my kind little guy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ada, tell me, what the hell are you?" Slightly turned around and asked seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ada didn’t answer, and reached out to the relatives’ holding the cheeks on both sides of Su Ge’s cheeks, and the white thumb touched Su Ge’s face: “Can touch this one The face of the gods suddenly felt a little unreal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug did not speak, looked at him calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ada is annoyed, but these annoyances have not affected her beauty, but have broken her fairy and sacred, making her more like a real person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then she opened her arms, under the white robe, the proud figure stood out, the dark hair was still flying, like a fairy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge stared at her for a moment and laughed: "I’m getting smarter, and now I’m happy for a decision I’ve made before, and I am more determined by my determination."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ada is very satisfied after listening, slightly leaned over and leaned his head on Su Ge’s shoulder, his face comfortable: "Your shoulder I can finally carry my weight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't want to be heavy." Su Ge is getting more and more happy. He was so close to Ada for the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s good to have a shoulder that I rely on. I finally know what she used to be." Ada is more comfortable, and finally the whole body is coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
