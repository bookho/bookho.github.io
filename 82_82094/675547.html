			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night, Connor put on clothes that are easy to hide and sneak in the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He received an order from the organization yesterday and came here to investigate the news of the Holy Grail document. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He reached for the small axe at the waist, and Connor was a little confident and full of confidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The things he experienced in Guinness two years ago made him unforgettable. The failed assassination made him almost lose his life, but he also got it. Unspeakable huge wealth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only the experience of failure, but also the secrets that ordinary people can't reach, and the most critical: the network. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the entire Assassin League, no one knows that he is one of the few outsiders in the world who are qualified to continue to maintain close ties and connections with the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had the opportunity to join the admirable church, but he gave up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t believe in the church, he just doesn’t want to leave his heart and creed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assassin does not require faith. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This incident has been circulated by the church in the late bell, and it is estimated that it is intended to disrupt the deployment of the Church of the Holy Blood in the capital." As a person, He is very clear about the true source of this news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In this case, stroke the water and see the excitement." Connor's heart is still quite leisurely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having experienced the events of Guinness, he not only completed the task of organizing the account, but also brought back some of the gods of death with the permission of Su Ge. Truth and secret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has made his position in the Assassin League soaring. He has now become an assassin expert with very high autonomy and has the qualification to choose his own mission. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yesterday he happened to pass through the city of Hui Yao, received orders from the headquarters, and then he directly contacted his relationship through special methods, and then determined two intelligences. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the news is indeed the church of the late bells, which is intended to disrupt the deployment of the Church of the Holy Blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, there is indeed a Grail document, which is suspected to be related to the "wisdom" Holy Grail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every Assassin has very strong stealth and psionic techniques. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Connor with rich experience and insights is also true. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His body is as light as the wind, moving quickly in the dark city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the way, he faintly felt the psionic volatility, and it seems that the explorers who heard the news arrived have already started. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Connor is not in a hurry to shoot, because investigating the Holy Grail document is not his only job. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He still has some private activities, such as helping the late bell church to secretly monitor these guys' every move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he did not teach, he knew and understood the teachings of the Church of the Late Bells, especially after hearing about the power of the Church of the Late Bells. He has a very good impression, so he is very happy to help the church do something within its power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, these private activities also have quite good rewards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two years, he has become a mystery from an ordinary assassin, and is an expert assassin, this credit They all exchanged for themselves in the church of the late bell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a passing through two streets, and when passing through a wealthy merchant at Blade Street, Connor felt the obvious psionic fluctuations, and then he saw The three clerics fled from the shadows and were terrified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t like the clergy, but he instantly felt the familiar atmosphere of the beautiful woman who took the lead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the finish of the evening clock that only a few people can feel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's really right!" Connor did not hesitate to scrape the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other side, Su Ge wore the church in the evening bell and left the home quietly, into the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, he has clearly felt that the whole city has started riots, and the chaotic spirits are raging in the night sky of the entire city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This evening, Su Ge has two goals. The first one is to confuse the conspiracy of the Church of the Holy Blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other is to find the master ghoul with a peristaltic brain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The life of those night patrols can not be white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having heard the clue of the female vampire he has seized, he can find the ghoul through the fluctuations and habits of psionic energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the premise is that the ghoul must be outside and releasing psionic power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a paradise, you don’t want to go." Su Ge, who danced in the night sky, already felt the turbid psionic power, his face was cold and swift Catch up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why are there master ghouls here?" Roland, who escaped from the apartment, was shocked and pale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They received the task during the day and stayed outside the apartment at seven o'clock in the evening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At eight o'clock they found the cold-hearted church near the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then three people skillfully cooperated, first launched their previously prepared traps, using silver dust to interfere with each other's psionic power, and then using vertigo runes on these evils The believers engaged in physical interference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This trick is very effective. After the cult is trapped, three people fire at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, there is no need to take care of the cultists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three people who thought it could be easily solved, just shot a few shots and felt that something was wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the horror of horror, the spirits that make their scalp numb emanate in the smoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, a horrible big paw suddenly appeared, and caught the three from the sky at a very fast speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master Ghouls!" The excellent Roland, who was educated by Luke, instantly discovered the true identity of the master of the big paw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time of shock, Roland took the teacher from her arms and gave her the enchantment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment the magic turned into a weird big bird and a master ghoul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then three people fled from the villa desperately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it was the case that three people felt dangerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just escaped from the apartment, I don’t know when there were five cult members who had surrounded themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lead is still a ghoul, at this time it has returned to its original form, the body is covered with a hard carapace, the mouth full of fangs slowly Developed a hoarse voice: "The clergyman, become our dish!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, the tongue in the mouth suddenly extended, like a spirit of consciousness The snake, wrapped around Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland immediately turned into a blood red in his eyes, and then took out a short knife and slammed forward: "Break!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;噗嗤! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Invisible power acts on the ghoul's body in a strange gesture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, the ghoul’s neck is like a cut, and it emits a lot of blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This...how is it possible!" This ghoul has a big eye and two steps of physical weakness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
