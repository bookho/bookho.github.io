			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fear of the blood of the ancient gods has a huge weight in the entire Church of the Holy Blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this sentence is not the ordinary believer, but the clergy of the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first of the teachings of the clergy is to fear the blood of the ancient gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clergyman’s equipment is also engraved with this sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even for clergy, the fear of the blood of the ancient gods is even higher than the goddess of March. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The blood of the ancient gods? These things are the blood of the ancient gods?" Su Ge still asked some unbelief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley said: "I have no interest in lie to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" What is the blood of the ancient gods? Is it the blood of those ancient gods?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley shook his head and said: "No, the blood that exists is inaccessible to humans."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is the blood of the ancient god?" Su Ge's curiosity was suddenly seduce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl casually sat on the couch and said, "It’s the blood of the ancient gods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "The ancient god of the Dai..." Hearing this, Su Ge’s head turned at a rapid speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brain that has been continuously developed and synchronized by the gods is running at this time, and countless scattered information is extracted and gathered together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嘶嘶嘶! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Five minutes later, Su Ge helped his forehead to return to God, although the problem was solved, but once again brought a heavy load to the brain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Drink."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a cup of fragrant coffee was placed in front of Su Ge, and a white porcelain cup with a faint lip print on the side, it seems that the temperature is tested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coffee is still a high concentration of Su Ge, and does not put sugar, but put some thick pure milk, which makes the coffee look a bit thick Thick, the sale is very good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug raised his head and saw that Shirley looked at himself with less trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled and took the coffee, took a sip, and closed his eyes and leaned against the chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is possible to make such a perfect coffee in five minutes, and only Xuelier who has a strong grasp of strength can do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if it is her, it takes five minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next ten minutes, Suge drank a bitter coffee while leaving the brain in a relaxed state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After ten minutes, the severe headache finally subsided, and Sug licked his lips and fell in love with the cup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first time that Shirley has prepared coffee for him, and the taste and concentration are perfect, much stronger than his own coffee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up and saw Shirley holding a crystal clear red bead in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bead is crystal clear, like a sturdy gem, and there are countless messy strands and reflective facets in the translucent middle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In her other hand, the book of Frenzy has been turned over about a dozen pages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pages have returned to normal and look like ordinary books. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I figured it out?" Shelly asked with her legs crossed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like a teacher asking a student who has been thinking for himself for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge nodded slightly and said: "The blood of the ancient gods is very likely to be the source of blood therapy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Blood therapy?" Shelly had some accidents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She doesn't know much about blood therapy, after all, she never needs blood therapy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded and said: "Blood therapy is divided into two important cores, the base and the contents."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The base is the core of blood therapy, it is a kind of advanced blood. This blood has strong compatibility and integration, can contain a lot of blood together, play its mystery, Different effects are formed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And the contents are different blood. For example, the blood of the male lion can make people strong, the blood of the sheep can make people quiet, the blood of the gecko It can make people recover quickly, etc."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The content is very easy to find, but can accommodate a lot of different blood at the same time, let it fully play mysterious effect The base is very difficult."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The blood that is more commonly used as the base now includes dragon blood, Yalong blood, giant blood, etc."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speaking of this, Su Ge stretched out his fingers and said: "However, this is after the formation of the system, the technology has a lot of progress. At the beginning, people found that the opportunity of blood therapy is absolutely the direct injection of the blood of these ancient gods into the human body, and the mysterious discovery obtained by chance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shelley heard this and nodded slightly: "Well, it is well-founded and the logic is clear. It seems that my cup of coffee has no white bubbles."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge said with a smile: "Don't look at your husband who I am."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley did not refute and continued to ask: "Is there any other information?" ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded and continued: "On the other hand, it also confirms why the phrase "the fear of the blood of the ancient gods" comes to the clergy Say, but it is not written in the normal doctrine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The god of the ancients, the evil god killed by the goddess of March and buried, can be said to be standing in opposition to the goddess of March. The blood of the holy blood church using the evil spirit itself is the shackles of the goddess of March. So the ancient god There is no way for the blood to spread in the world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "On the other hand, the people of the Church of the Holy Blood have been saying that they fear the blood of the ancient gods, optimistic, It is awe, not faith and worship. This shows that the Church of the Holy Blood has a good understanding of the overall situation of the Holy Blood Maze and knows the true colors of those monsters."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, Su Ge’s eyes sharply said: “On the other hand, there is a problem in the blood therapy of the Church of the Holy Blood. Even in the past, there have been many large-scale, even the Church of the Holy Blood feels fear and numbness. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Blood therapy..." Shirley took the ball in his hand and was interested in his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug recalls what he saw in the coma for the first time in his blood treatment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought of a possibility." Su Ge said very seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Say."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The blood therapy is likely to wake up during use The animal nature of human beings makes people fall into frenzy." Su Ge said solemnly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl asked: "How come?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have used blood therapy In the coma, I saw some red things that made me fall into madness and frenzy. After I woke up, my mind saw the first large-scale growth."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Now, in retrospect, combined with the experience of going crazy several times along the way, the red thing is definitely my animality."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Shirley did not have an accident, looked at Su Ge and said: "That is, you may become a monster?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Suge heard a smile and said: "Of course it is impossible, my night clock can even make the beastly person return to normal, the hidden danger of blood therapy does not pose any threat to me."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
