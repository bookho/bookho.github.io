			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This feeling is like eating a cockroach." In the confusion, Su Ge thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This coma is the most uncomfortable thing he feels. He seems to be in a state of half-sleeping and half-awake. Everything is so illusory and at the same time true. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He feels that he is in a strange place, and will be swallowed up by the sea, not only numbness and cramps, but also his mouth will be bitter, or skin Itching, stomach tingling...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, he woke up from that very disgusting state, when he opened his eyes, he saw It is a white ceiling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is... my room?" Su Ge got up slowly with some doubts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as I was together, I felt a violent dizziness, and my body was heavy, and the whole coordination had some problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turning his head and looking at it, he saw two large pinholes in the arms of his left and right arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This size of needle, is this infusion too rough?" Su Ge muttered to get out of bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Mill came in from the door and smiled and asked: "How do you feel?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Su Ge took a look at the body: "Not very good, it seems to change a body, don't listen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mill nodded: "Normal, after all, I I injected two kinds of potions directly to you last night."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!?" Hearing this Su Ge's eyes, staring at Mill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mill showed a smug smile and said, "You should thank me, because of my help, you can now use the potion normally."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you mean?" Su Ge is a bit aggressive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mill did not conceal, first said the anatomy of last night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You saw it?" Su Ge was cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mill's expression was a bit stiff, and then barely smiled: "Nothing malicious, and thanks to this, I found a major secret that you have never known."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What secret?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You who have this heart can use the potion normally. You The previous two uses, only the amount of toxins stored in your blood is not enough, the body does not adapt to this similar thing, so there will be such a strong rejection."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Speaking, I said what he found last night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sugg blinked after hearing it. Didn’t he think that his ice heart had this kind of use? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mill continues to explain: "This is like the adaptability of muscle exercise. The first time you exercise, your body will be severely sore, and you will not feel it after you get used to it." I had an experiment last night when you were in a coma, and found that when you used shark potion and dragon potion, you have fully adapted and there will be no abnormalities. This is because you have these two kinds in your blood. The toxins of the potion make your body adapt to these two potions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Mill's eyes flashed with brilliance: "So come to a conclusion The core medium in which you use the potion is your blood and heart. As long as your blood contains the toxins of the potions, you can use which potions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "So, on the basis of sharks and dragons, I gave you the inferior lion potion and the inferior eagle eye potion directly in the blood. The result is the same as I imagined. During the initial phase, your body produces a severe rejection, but with the blood band After these toxins have been in your body for two laps, the whole reaction quickly subsides and is controlled by the heart."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, Mill explained the two potions Effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inferior lion potion: After use, you can temporarily increase the physical strength by three times for half an hour and toxin 14 points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inferior eagle eye potion: After use, you can temporarily increase your vision of your eyes by six times for half an hour and 12 toxins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The effect is good, what does this toxin point mean?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mir explained: "This represents the toxic amount of the potion. Everyone has different anti-toxicity depending on constitution, talent, and age. Normal adult male anti-toxicity is 5. Toxins below 5 can be digested by their own immune system."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And our hunters are not immune to all toxins. We only However, it has higher anti-toxicity than ordinary people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"General ordinary devils, anti-toxicity is around 30, and master-level anti-toxicity Usually around 100. This 100 is our limit. If we take more than 100 total toxins in the potion, then we will also be poisoned by the potion. For example."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The superior male lion potion, toxin 40. The superior shark potion, toxin 43. I take these two potions at the same time, my body has 83 points of toxicity. At this time I take the lower level Hawkeye potion, the toxin has 95/100, which is allowed. But if I take the intermediate eagle eye with 23 toxins Then the toxin will reach 106/100. At this time, I will be poisoned because the toxin is exceeded, and even die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge heard this suddenly The medicine has a very deep understanding: "I didn't expect so much to say here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, at the same time, according to the limits of physical growth, anyone It is impossible to use more than four potions at the same time, otherwise the person's body will not be able to withstand the dramatic increase and dissolve."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are really dangerous." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simply understand the situation, Su Ge looked at his hand and asked: "So, can I use these four potions at the same time?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't dream, you are just a special case. Although your own anti-toxicity has improved significantly, it is around 15 o'clock. Now you can only Activate a potion, and they are all subordinate potions." Mil cold smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
