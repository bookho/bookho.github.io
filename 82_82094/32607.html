			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the contract was signed, Gerlos turned and took a suitcase from the bottom of the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This suitcase looks very upscale, the box is black and the material looks like some kind of wood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The box is not large, about 60 centimeters long, about 50 centimeters wide, about twenty centimeters thick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two sides of the box have dark red shades that look very solemn and noble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle part of the front of the box is the emblem of the Church of the Holy Blood, the holy grail filled with blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The back of the ancient words of Kabatos is engraved with a sentence: "Please fear the blood of the ancient gods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The surrounding corners are locked with silver-gray iron pieces. On the top are two silver-gray metal handles. The opening is a silver-gray, sophisticated metal combination lock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The overall feel of this box is very comfortable, very tall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here is the standard equipment of each mysterious church, including the identity token of the church, a hunting magic pistol dedicated to the monster, fifty blood Silver bullets, gloves for touching mysterious things, badges for inductive monsters, and two robes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge screamed and asked: "This Is it for me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, this is the standard equipment that every church mysterious person will issue." Gerlos nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s hand touched the box and said the smooth feel: “This box is worth at least thirty francs.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss ignores Suger’s lack of ambition and continues: “I will let Orson give you a position to detect a detective, and you will be working here for the next two months. The ordinary police discerned the mysterious situation of the case and reported it in time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understand." Su Ge squeezed the handle of the box and nodded hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After two months, I will change according to the performance. If you are qualified, you can continue to work here. If the performance is very good, I will consider making you a priest and enter the work of the sinner."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Su Ge’s heart is full of fighting spirits: “Yes!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I don’t know God’s punishment What is it, but it sounds very tall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After everything was talked about, Jellos threw a old book that was not too thick and said: "Then, it’s a career problem. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are a total of 82 current mainstream careers and career brief introductions and abilities in this book. You can look at it and feel right. After one, tell me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug took up the book and curiously opened the catalogue, and suddenly a large number of occupations appeared in his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hunter, swordsman, killer, archer, priest, priest, judge, lawyer, musician, painter, singer...<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All kinds of colors, beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eighty-two occupations include all of Saul’s current occupations in all aspects of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s really detailed, every profession represents a unique knowledge, and lawyers can use the knowledge of the rules of the law to the extreme, even forcing others to Follow your own rules. The archer can even shoot a flying fly 100 meters away. The singer can disturb the mind of others through singing, and the painter can even turn the painting into reality..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at this book, Su Ge feels that the door to the new world opens to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss is not in a hurry, while Su Ge knows, he continues to deal with the death sect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This case can be said to be the biggest cult accident in the Empire in the past two decades. If handled properly, you can be promoted to the Archbishop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At that time, you may know how to restore my feelings." Gerlos thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After an hour and a half, Su Ge finished watching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After three repeated screenings, he locked his eyes on the three professions of the priest, the stalker, and the detective. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, with his current understanding of sound, he is more suitable for musicians, or psychics. But he is very clear that his true golden finger is the magical body and analytical power of the dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So his real career is the kind of career that requires a lot of knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the priest, the stalker, the detective is like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main direction of the priest is to discover the beliefs and minds in the depths of the human soul, to have spiritual communication, and to guide the power of the gods. And for the soul, evil spirits have unique control and lethality, and through the super soul to let themselves sublimate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The direction of the stalker’s development is very simple, that is, the ultimate hunting of prey. But the pursuit of this limit requires a lot of knowledge, geography, weather, climate, traps, etc. In the annotations, the stalker is labeled as the most promising career because it involves too much stuff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Detectives are similar to scouts. He needs to analyze the environment, people's psychology, the details of everything, the powerful logic and the ultimate analysis. With the development of detectives can even have insight into the people, seeing the truth of the event, can be called the ability to predict the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although I have a cpu of the gods, but the stalker is too complicated, I don't think I can master so much knowledge. Although it seems that this is A hidden profession specially prepared for me, but as far as the current situation is concerned, I don’t have to take risks. Detectives are not good things. The story of Cthulhu tells me that detectives are not allowed to die at all. I don’t want to let my spirits rise too much. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, the priest is the safest at the moment, and because of the contractual relationship, it seems that there are additional benefits to choosing the sacred officer. It's better to be steady. After all, this kind of thing is too strange. If you are careless, you will lose all of you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
