			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a cold night hunting, and the robes of Suger’s body are constantly flying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s the early winter of late autumn, the temperature of the night has reached minus ten degrees, but Su Ge wearing thin clothes does not have any cold feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it because the death has a cold-resistant super ability?" Su Ge thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, every person who crosses will have a golden finger. Is this my golden finger?" I thought that this Su Ge was a little hot. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is also a veteran old bookworm. He has seen a lot through the novel. It can be said that it is a deep traversal, of course, only theoretically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a difficult walk about a kilometer, Su Ge panted and couldn’t move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not to mention that the body of Su Ge Sotos is weak, and now he has no strength to continue to go for at least two days without eating. Fortunately, the place where he was thrown away was not far from the city, and now you can see the street lights and buildings on the edge of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Respite, Suge stepped up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗷呜呜呜~~~<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Su Ge suddenly burst into flames Wolverine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, he faintly heard the slight friction in the grass behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My day, no! The cold wind did not freeze me, I will be killed by the wolf!?" Su Ge thought, the eye instinctively turned Looking at the head, I saw a pair of eyes shining with strange blue light shining on the grass through the grass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咕噜. Su Ge swallowed his mouth and ran without saying anything! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an office worker, he has not dealt with the experience of wolves, and is now being tracked, the instinct is to run. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Run! Run! It's safe to run into the city!" Su Ge was very nervous in his heart, took out the strength of breastfeeding, and fought his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Su Ge accelerate, the wolf behind it suddenly accelerated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since ancient times, the two legs are destined to run without four legs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Su Ge doesn’t know how far he has run. At this moment, he only feels that his body is falling apart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the city is in front of you, when Su Ge thought that he was about to escape from the ascension, he suddenly felt his feet smashed by a stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My Day!" Su Ge’s eyes were wide, but he couldn’t control his body completely. A dog rushed to the ground and ate it. Big mouth snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the moment of the fall, Su Ge suddenly turned over and picked up a stone from the snow and lay on the ground to prepare for the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least this will prevent the wolf from attacking from behind his own corners. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Su Ge just turned over and did not respond, the wolf had rushed over with a cold wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hurry! The wolves in the outer world are so fierce!?" Su Ge’s eyes widened and his face was unbelievable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, the wolf has fallen over Su Ge’s body, two claws pressed against his chest, and a pair of blue-lighted eyes staring down at Su grid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger is lying on the ground at this time without rash action, but cautiously a lot of this wolf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wolf is not small, about one meter tall and about one meter tall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body is covered with smooth, supple fur, and the hair on the back and overhead is dark and shiny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face, neck, abdomen and limbs are white hairs like white clouds, which look unusually beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wolf's claws slowly stepped on the chest of Sug, and then it seemed to find something. Then the big mouth with fangs opened and slowly approached Su Ge's face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug has pinched the stone and tried to calm himself down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Calm, it's not the time to attack." Su Ge tightened and his heart beat and jumped out of his throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few seconds later, the wolf's big mouth came to Su Ge, the next second...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The wolf actually put his tongue out against Su Ge’s face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"what!?" was stunned by this, Su Ge completely stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This action is not the action of the wolf to hunt the prey, but the action of the dog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ha! what! what! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Su Ge heard a burst of dogs in the big mouth of the wolf and saw the happy sigh of the owner, very close relatives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the moonlight and the streetlights in front, Sug, who is struggling with his body, carefully examines the "wolf" on his body, and the next second is a shot. Brain door: "Day, this is a wolf, this is obviously a husky!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black back white legs, there are two whites on the black hair on the eyes Point, blue eyes, long face and high erect ears, this is a standard husky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This two ha is very enthusiastic, sticking out his tongue against Su Ge’s face is a madness, just like a dog who has not seen his master for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger was lying on the ground, his chest violently gasping, and his face was helpless: "This TM is almost exhausted by a second chase." "I am also the first one!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, Su Ge’s head lifted up slightly and looked at the huskies’ brows: “Sug Sotos There is no dog, is this completely strange dog over-enthusiastic? We don't seem to have anything to do with it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the second time, the head gradually went down and began to force Sug's left chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug saw this look unexpectedly: "What's wrong? Is there something in my chest?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Speaking, Su Ge reached out and touched his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is frowning! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he doesn’t touch the soft skin on his left chest, it’s a weird and hard thing, and it feels like a stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly sat up, Su Ge hurriedly took off his robes, unbuttoned the white shirt inside and looked at his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey! This joke is a big hit!" Su Ge is not a god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, in the heart of Su Ge’s left chest, there is no normal body tissue, replaced by an ice blue quirky ice crystal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ice crystal flashes a blue light similar to that of Erha, with a pale blue mist squirming inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the fog, you can see something like a bell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second Haha sees this cold ice heart state full of happiness, a few beats in the original, will throw Su Ge down, sticking out his tongue for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being under the pressure of the second, Su Ge looked at the sky with a sluggish look, and the palm of his hand touched the stunned fur of Erha, and said: "Although I don't know. What is the reason for this heart, but it is certain that there is a great connection between Erha and the heart. And this two ha is definitely not an ordinary dog."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Su Ge meditated, Erha put his tongue out against Su Ge’s chest and it was a madness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Su Ge gradually felt that the thing was slowly creeping. When he looked up, he found that the heart of the ice had hidden under the skin, his own The chest has returned to normal skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This should be the reason why I am crossing, resurrecting, and not afraid of the cold." Su Ge thought about wearing clothes and standing up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
