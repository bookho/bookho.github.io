			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Duchess of Merris passed away. I heard that she was attacked by a cultist. After she was cursed, she also infected everyone in the Duke’s house. Now the entire ducal manor is blocked, only allowed to enter, no flies can fly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The streets in the early morning, people heard the gossip, In twos and threes, he whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to Su Ge slowly walking on the street, he turned to look at the direction of the Duke’s House. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He still didn’t feel anything, but he faintly guessed some possibilities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When passing by a street, a carriage rushed through, and the speed of the rush quickly swept Sug. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Long eyes! You are a half-dead!" In the car window, a cigarette, a yellow tooth, a pale youth It is a swearing swearing and contempt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge turned slightly and looked at the young man, not talking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other pedestrians around him looked disgusted at the carriage in the distance, but could not help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you okay?" asked a delicate young man in a neat suit and a cane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled and shook his head: "Nothing, thank you for your concern." Saul, Su Ge showed a soft and close smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man didn’t expect Su Ge to laugh like this... It’s so comfortable, he smiled and said: “That’s good, I’ll stay away from that waste later. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, I left in a hurry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug continued to move slowly and faintly said: "There is no more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Hang! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, and suddenly there was a deafening explosion in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a scream, I heard someone shouting: "Not good! Fast! Save the Baron Ligan from the carriage! Fast!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge As usual, walking slowly on the road, slowly said: "Now, you should be able to understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finished, he turned in one direction, Going to a certain direction in the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside the ruins of the distant streets, two master-class casual service bishops stood on the edge of the accident and were still undecided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was an accident just here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the fast-sprinting carriage passed the corner of the street, the iron wheels rubbed against Mars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that moment, the underground gas pipeline suddenly leaked due to years of disrepair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result, like the explosive power of the explosion, the baron's carriage was blown up more than ten meters away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it’s weird, although there’s a wide range of explosions, there’s just no other pedestrians around, and even the driver’s groom was only scratched after being thrown out, no Other injuries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The baron sitting in the carriage, the whole body bone was broken, the internal organs were shattered, and the roof collapsed when it fell, and his head was smashed into the chest. It has been completely dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a big accident, just the death of this baron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no mystery, no plan, no murder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything is a coincidence, everything is in line with the common sense of the world, everything is like an accident that happens by chance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the premise is that the baron did not have the "ordinary person" who was preparing to cross the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this the shelter of God's grace?" asked the male bishop on the left, about 50 years old, muttering to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday's encirclement, they also participated, but not at the side of Laurie, but in the distance, to prevent Su Ge from fleeing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although they didn’t watch it up close, they also knew the secrets and became a member of the tracking Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The skin around him is white, his face is bitter with a soft middle-aged woman: "I don't know, before this, no one knows what God is." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But, the feeling of yesterday, you should feel it!" The male bishop's face was faint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yesterday at the river, Su Ge showed the phenomenon of "God's grace" for the first time, all those who were hostile to Su Ge At that moment, I felt the innumerable horror of the dead soul staring at myself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two turned and left, watching Su Ge’s slow moving back, the male bishop asked indefinitely: “The thing of the Purple Moon Cathedral, you heard about it. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well." The female bishop nodded and did not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yesterday, the church members who were rescued made a request to the church, hoping to forgive Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason is that he is not a cultist. He protects the Purple Moon Cathedral, protects the goddess' people, and even gives up everything he has, repelling The king of yellow clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a big problem, and many people in the Holy See know it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the most devout believers, their souls are not filthy, there is no distortion in their hearts, the hymns they sing can cause the blessing of the goddess, no one will I think they will betray the church and join the cult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishop of the man asked: "Do you see him like a cultist?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Some things can't just look at the surface." The female bishop replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The male bishop was silent for a few seconds without answering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If I can, I don't want to hurt him." The female bishop said, silently continuing his work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only walking alone in the streets of this city, Su Ge does not know how many people in the secret follow him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn’t know, and he doesn’t plan to know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a flower bed, Su Ge looks at the butterflies and bees flying in the middle of the flowers, squinting like a naive child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This butterfly and the bee and the earth are not a variety at all." Su Ge has a new discovery today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I envy them to fly?" A familiar voice sounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s perception is no longer sharp, he turned his head and looked at it, and saw Bart, wearing a normal dress, watching himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug did not stand up, palms held his chin and looked at the bees and said: "The envy is not flying, the envy is their specificity."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bat followed and knelt down and looked at the bee collecting honey and asked, "Are you very frustrated?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug It’s not a good look, he glanced at him: “If this is heard by my family, your tongue is gone, not kidding.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bad listen After a smile, he asked: "Looking out, you seem to realize a lot."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge sighed: "The more Ming Wu The more confusion I have, the more I think that the more knowledge I touch, the easier it is to get in touch with the truth and restore those dusty pasts. So I don't reject any knowledge, don't reject any mystery, as long as I can let me know more, I Will be accepted."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The more you know, the more distracting you have, and the limited energy of human beings is more easily dispersed. Once there is no If you achieve a specificity in one direction, then this person will not be eligible to reach a higher level."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before I was, it was." The grid stood up and sat on the chair, reaching for his legs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has been stunned for forty minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart sighed: "But even so, you are one of the youngest mysterious masters in history."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Suge sighed and shook his head: "I can have that kind of achievement, and it has nothing to do with me. At that time, I was just a container."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Container!?" Bart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg’s savage said: “The container used to carry the knowledge of the gods.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;! ! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Bart’s heart slammed, and the various non-human gestures that Suger showed before were explained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Su Ge did not deceive Bart, as he said, he was really just a container. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This truth is also after the loss of some mystery, Su Ge is faintly clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All his mystery is given by the body of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night clock, death, funeral, cold flame, even the control of the Holy Grail, etc., even the key knowledge is not his own, but God Body analysis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After losing everything and thinking about it, Su Ge suddenly found himself to be just a container. He was not qualified to be called a genius, and he was not qualified to use it. Kind of power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart silent for a long time, reached out and took a shot of Su Ge’s shoulder: "What are your plans for the next time? Actually, your current situation is not what you think. So good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge raised his head slightly: "The Holy Blood Church's creation is successful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know?" Bart had some accidents. There were not many people who knew this. This is what his teacher told him through the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge said casually: "After mastering enough information, the deduction will become very basic. The evil spirits in Drake's body should now have absorbed enough nutrients, and those involved in the warlocks and manors are It became the nutrients and sacrifices needed for the coming of the gods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart shook his head and said: "I don't really know this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug turned and swayed the lovely little yellow flower next to the bench, calmly said: "The arrival of the Son of God did not cause a storm, it should be the real big man of the Church of the Holy Blood, it is very possible It is a left-behind saint, or a monster in the stars of heaven."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bad dignified: "They are going to attack you with the Son of God?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not so important, they just want to create a god in batches, pray for this way to let the gods come to the world in a new way, let the goddess of March bring those horrors The monsters are all expelled."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"March Women It really exist? "Bart asked temptation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many years, the goddess of March has very few miracles, and even many mysteries have begun to doubt the existence of the March goddess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They certainly exist, but they are trapped and trapped in the old dreams of the past."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, the connection with the gods has been cut off, and all the information is sorted out in a human mindset. As a completely outsider, Su Ge has discovered that many gods cannot have the same intelligence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart listened to his face, after all, he did not know what was the old dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In any case, you have to be careful, since the Son of God has come, he is absolutely capable of breaking the grace of you. In addition, the king of the yellow dress has not left. You have a hatred with Him, and He will not let you go easily." Bart seriously warned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly: "Thank you for your kindness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, Su Ge seriously Looking at her: "It is my pleasure to know you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said to bow to the barr. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart was a little embarrassed, reaching out and holding up Su Ge sighed: "Now there are not many good people, you are definitely one. But I can only help this. It’s not too much here, I’m going to leave tomorrow.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Along the way.” Su Ge sent a sincere blessing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farewell to Bart, Kass came quietly and asked: "Adult, what is the order?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sugg’s eyes are cold and said: “The notice goes on, you can act. They have lost hope of redemption.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Card After listening to the fire in the eyes, the body quickly left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the order was issued, Su Ge still walked on the street. He still has his purpose. There is a person who needs to see one side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the afternoon, Su Ge held a cup in one hand and a hard bread in one hand, and went to his destination while eating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very remote old manor is imprisoned by Emilia’s vows manor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the arrival of Su Ge has caused all the awe here. All the clergymen looked at Su Ge with fear and fear, but no one dared to step forward. And even screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Blood Church’s intelligence system is excellent, and these people already know what Sug is doing today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug stood at the door and said calmly: "I just want to talk to my old friend."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Saying, the last piece of bread will be eaten with clear water, pick up the sleeves and wipe the mouth, and under the horror of more than a dozen priests, walk into the manor all the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emilia is still in the previous room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in just a few days, Suge clearly felt that Emilia had a huge change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
