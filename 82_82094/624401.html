			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the look of the lazy Sini priest, Su Ge was silent for a moment, with a smile on his lips, curiously asked: "You are so prominent in front of me." My own means, are you not afraid of any misconduct?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French Sini waved, countless purple light particles scattered, beautiful purple sword changed It became the dilapidated long sword full of dents, and the purple in the eyes of Father Sini also dissipated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the powerful existence that just made people feel awesome changed back to the lazy middle-aged priest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My heart is not polluted, just like this purple moonlight, my will, my character, my heart and the great purple moon The goddess keeps resonating."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stop, Father Sini looked at Su Ge and said, "I didn't find any filth on your body, no matter what Blood, psionic, or soul."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge listened to the clap with a thumbs up: "You are right, I can feel your Existence, you are totally different from those filthy clerics. Your presence reminds me of the Holy Father."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Sug said slightly sideways:" Please come in, I think you and I should have a lot to say, it is too rude to stand here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And..." Su Ge Smiley, with a special meaning in his eyes: "There will be some suspicion when the night watcher returns."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sini Putting the sword behind you, the strong body turned over the iron fence lightly, and came to Su Ge in three or two steps: "If there is wine, it is the best."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I remember to remove the rest day, the clergyman is forbidden," said Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French Sini did not speak, and went very generously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the living room, Bernice respectfully took two bottles of wine, In the inspiration of Su Ge, he did not take the cup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shelley has gone upstairs and she is not interested in this old priest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After preparation, Bernice and Betty also returned to the room, leaving two people sitting opposite each other in the bright living room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger opened the bottle with a bottle, and each person took a sip of the bottle, and Father Sini said, "The wine is a good thing." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course it's a good thing, my other drinker is very valued for the wine." Sug smiled and responded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French Sini took another sip, his sullen blue eyes, his eyes gradually becoming sharp, and asked: "Although I know you better, I still need to know who you are."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger listened and asked: "Is this important?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge said and took another sip and said, "My name should know."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fake," Father Sini said directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug said again: "My name, you know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear this, West Father Nie seems to think of something and is immersed in contemplation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge continued: "Information equivalence is the basis for mutual trust, but it is a pity that my current name I can't say." Father Sini took a bottle and took a sip in silence, saying coldly: "It’s a boring trick. It seems that you should make them a big ugly thing." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sughaha smiled: "Of course, the faces of those people at the time, now I can't help but laugh."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ha!" took another sip, and Father Sini snorted and said with a cheerful voice: "If you don't bear the shit mark, I want to kill those bastards."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was shocked to hear this Su Ge heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This lowest point, looks unsettled, cynical old priest, actually carrying a holy mark! ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is simply a fantasy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French Sini noticed the appearance of Su Ge, casually said: "St. Mark is not a rare thing, you have it on your body, not so surprised. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"............" Hearing this, Su Ge was a little cautious and did not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French Sini continued: "Reassure, I have no malice against you. I haven’t seen people so clean for a long time, send hair Grievance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Archbishop of Emilia is also very clean." Su Ge suddenly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French Sini listened to a glimpse and then sighed: "She...is really clean, but she involves too many things and is not suitable for each other." "Crossing the heart."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh!? Is it true that I am a very suitable person?" Su Ge asked unexpectedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French Sini grinned and revealed some yellowish teeth saying "Of course."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "How come?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are the kind of person who is very curious and extremely good at keeping secrets. You are eager for knowledge and more eager to only I know the secrets that others don't know, so that you can feel satisfied."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Sugerton was speechless, silent for a long time and asked: “Don't these be written on my face and psionics?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French Sini’s analysis of him can be said to be no difference, deep into the bone marrow . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha!" Father Sini smiled and explained: "Of course not. This is the knowledge that the great Purple Moon God gave me, just like this moonlight. General."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard this Su Ge face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the goddesses of March, the goddess of purple moon symbolizes mystery and science, and is the most awkward existence among the three goddesses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three festivals of the year, the Moon Festival is the most worthy of celebration, the Blood Festival is the most daunting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Purple Moon Festival is plain and flat. There are no jealousies and no celebrations on that day. People only need to make simple prayers before going to bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the distribution of folk beliefs, the goddess of purple moon is very rare because of its special power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This also makes the Purple Moon goddess extremely incomprehensible and mysterious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The goddess of purple moon represents mystery and technology, and Father Sini believes in him. It should be able to mysteriously part of the body and embed some inhuman fields. , glimpse the essence of mankind. It is similar in nature to the beliefs that I give to believers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows very well about the gods, he has roughly analyzed the priests of Sini Positioning and ability source. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is really a convenient ability." Su Gelu said with envy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French Sini took another drink and half a bottle of wine was gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "At the same time, it also made me see countless filth and sin, while letting me hate everything around me, and finally completely separate myself from those locusts. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is why I am still a regular patrol priest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge could feel his helplessness and anger, and exclaimed: "Sure enough, the Church of the Holy Blood is not completely rotted, and there are people like you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "However, I can't change the church, I can't change anything, I can't even kill those disgusting fake guys." Father Sini said, his face was full of temper and gloomy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
