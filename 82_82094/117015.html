			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Bart saw Su Ge, he suddenly got a big jump. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sugg face at this time is a little pale, the spirit is very bad, especially under the white shirt collar, revealing a trace of weird bruises, are telling Bart Su Ge’s situation is very bad today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My friend, what's wrong with you?" Bart asked for a quick step of concern and hurriedly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger was very tired at this time and whispered: "Looking for a safe place, I have just been attacked."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Bart’s heart suddenly jumped, then immediately called Jike, and helped Su Ge to come to the lift on the left side of the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a device similar to the Earth Elevator, but his power is not electricity, but a steam engine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole process, three people and one dog did not speak, only the metal gear turned the bite and the crisp sound, the atmosphere was quiet and scary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a minute, the lift stopped and three people entered a corridor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This seems to be the corridor of a modern office building with neat doors on both sides with different company logos on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After three people marched ten meters to the left, three people entered the door marked "Tur Investment Company". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is not a company inside, but it will be a family living room. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The floor is covered with soft carpets, with luxurious leather sofas in the middle, and the walls are surrounded by ancient murals, which are very stylish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger is not paying attention to any gentleman's demeanor at this time. He sat down on the sofa and said hoarsely: "I am very painful now, give I am going to order a high concentration of coffee. This time I add some milk and sugar. I need to add some energy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jike immediately nodded and turned to prepare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart sat down and looked at the sullen Sugg whispered, "What happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unexpectedly, I am your Green Flame Brothers." The hypnotist of the meeting attacked. Just half an hour ago, I almost killed myself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Sug untied the neckline, revealing more More purple-black skin, and two hand prints<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this, Bart’s face is extremely dignified, biting his lips and saying, “Impossible, they were in the city before The eyeliner has been removed by me, they can't find you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge touched the head of Erha and nodded and said, "Well, they stare. I am not because of the previous things, but the things this morning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You met them!?" Bart was tight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg then said the entire case from beginning to end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to these, Bart’s face was very ugly: “I didn’t expect them to have reached this step.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you mean?" Su Ge asked his forehead and whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Bart did not conceal, truthfully explained: "The original fire is the avatar of our faith, or the incarnation. But my Lord does not exist in this world. In order to complete the summoning, you must need the container and the medium. The Joseph you said is very likely that his spirit has been linked with my master for a moment, thus creating a medium for summoning. Now the medium is ready, then you need to prepare It’s a lot of life energy and containers.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“And from the fact that they are now daring to seduce the police to pay attention to this matter, I’m afraid the container is ready. Nowadays, you only need to prepare enough life force to call."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Jike came over and handed over the fragrant coffee, which is also very intimate Come over a plate of cookies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you!" Su Ge thanked him after taking the coffee, a hot coffee, and his headache was relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are the consequences if they are fully summoned?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bad touched his chin and said, "It depends on the situation of summoning. But according to the current situation, the avatar summoned should not be too horrible, but even In this way, the flame will also drain all the life of the entire city. Not only people, but also animals, plants, and even the land under our feet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was shocked to hear this Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has little knowledge of Turzcha on Earth, he only knows that this is an invisible dancer in the palace of Assos, specifically what is his ability It is also unclear that the impression of this foreign god in Su Ge’s mind has always been a beautiful and beautiful dancer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, this is definitely a pot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, listening to Bart said that Su Ge had to re-examine the actual effect of this "beautiful dancer". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinking, Su Ge said directly: "I have Joseph’s home address here. According to the curator, he is drawing something. Crazy, then if we find the painting in his home, can we find a way to stop the original fire?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart thought about it later Seriously asked: "You will say the whole process of attacking you when you arrive at the museum. It must be very detailed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug feels a little at this time Something is wrong, so I explained the process in detail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While saying, Su Ge determined the details, and waited for Bart to remind him after the talk, Su Ge suddenly said: "The curator has a problem!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not stupid." Bart's eyes flashed a hint of approval. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The calming Su Ge at this time, the brain only noticed the mysterious calmness of the curator, and the flexibility that is completely incompatible with age, the brain instantaneously overpowered The same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart continues: "You are still sensible. If you really went directly to Joseph’s home, I am afraid that you are now mad and you are very dead. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
