			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this voice, Moss suddenly shuddered, the whole body's skin was full of goose bumps, and the hair was blown up like a fried mouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His door is through three warning procedures, and he firmly believes that no one has triggered his own alarm, and no one has opened his door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even as an expert detective, he did not hear anyone’s footsteps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he was shocked to feel that there were two horrors behind him that made him tremble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The direction of the sound came as if it came from behind his neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was stiff and motionless, like a human figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the cold and depressed atmosphere, his eyes saw a gloved hand sticking out of his shoulder and took the remaining two pages in his hand. The most important core material. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh!? The chance is really detailed, look out, as a detective you are a good seed." The voice of the drama continues to come from behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s really thrilling. If you pass the two pages of information out, it might really cause me some unnecessary trouble." The voice is with a thrilling tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moss feels extremely cold at the moment, as if falling into the frozen abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This cold is emitted from the soul to freeze the whole body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, this cold, with deep despair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His body still has no movement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not that he doesn’t want to, but he doesn’t dare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the dark bedroom, he clearly saw in the dark shadows that countless dark monsters were wriggling and wandering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These monsters he can't describe, he even saw this horrible monster turned from darkness for the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time his eyes don’t dare to turn, because he has the feeling that with a little change, these monsters will rush up and tear themselves Then eat it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In silence, he saw a young man in a black suit and a robe walking over, sitting on the sofa in front of himself in a casual manner, dark and bright The leather shoes step on the hard-working circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of the youth is extremely familiar, because in his few days, all his attention has been placed on his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge squats on the chair with his legs crossed, and Shirley, with a mask, sits casually, and countless darkness swells around her, looking She is like a queen who controls the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this, Morston’s eyes shrink like nails. At this moment, he is extremely scared to discover this beautiful woman who almost never talks. It’s even more horrible than your goal! ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Impossible! How is this possible! How can the four colleges have such connections! This is impossible!" Moss was in a big heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although his heart is awkward, his face is extremely pale at this time, because what he can see from the dark eyes of two people is only the high-level drama. Like two humans, look at a dead insect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge said with a thumbs up on his face: "You are really a good person, a talented person who collects intelligence."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, the right hand holding the file slammed into a smoky blue flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, the important information that the two pages did not have time to pass out suddenly turned into a sand-like ice crystal, slipping down Su Ge’s fingers. Scattered on a soft carpet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This...what is this! Are you not a swordsman!?" When he saw the flame that was called, Morton felt that he had been Huge stimuli, a look with a twist, asked in a crying voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge smiled and asked: "Who told you, I am a swordsman?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;! ! ! ! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Moss’s body suddenly became stiff, and then he ignored the monsters in the dark, sitting on the ground with powerlessness, his face full of stiffness and sluggishness. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, his self-confidence slammed and was smashed by Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Moss's appearance at this time, Shirley nodded very happy, as if to see the audience of the best performances. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You...you...you are not using a sword? Your sword, your swordsmanship, not what a swordsman is!" Moss reluctantly stabilizes himself. The will, the voice said with a trembling voice,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge waved his cane and said: "Who rules that fighting with a sword must be a swordsman?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Impossible! Don't think that I am so deceiving! Professional pharmacy is a tool for people to concentrate on. Since you choose swordsmanship and vibration as your knowledge, then you It must be a swordsman. My observation is not wrong!" Moss widened his eyes and had a blind confidence on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge casually said: "Occupational pharmacy can really block people's exploration of other broad knowledge, but it does not mean that they can't be mysterious without professional pharmacy." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?!" Hearing this, Moss widened his eyes and his face was incredible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s face is full of ridiculous smiles: “If you judge with your eyes, I have a lot of careers. God officials, swordsmen, fighting Home, hypnotist, illusionist, etc. These names are very suitable for me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Su Ge raised his right hand and made a finger: " Just like this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A ray of light flashed, Moss looked at it and then found himself back to his hometown. He even saw himself as a child and saw himself. Parents saw the calm and happy pastoral life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
