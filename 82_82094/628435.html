			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Duke expressed doubts, the Stephen Butler on the side asked respectfully: "According to the situation of Lord Wright, he was not under any coercion, nor was he When a person stuns and loses his memory, how can other people leave such a serious mark behind him when he does not feel it? With this kind of scratch, there should be a strong feeling of pain."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The side of Duketon thought: "Don't you say that Uncle Wright was attacked by other mysterious people and was hypnotized?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Suge casually said: "There is no such thing as you said, I ask you. Your uncle should have been to the Fengyue place before returning, or has a relationship with a woman?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke said that he didn’t know much: "I don't know this yet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stephen's key explanation Said: "Yes, according to Wright's servant, he met a beautiful woman in a ballroom." The moving lady, then spent the night together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger said casually: "That's right, the so-called beautiful woman who has a xing relationship is a woman. Ghoul, this scratch is estimated to be left when the sheets are rolled."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;! ! ! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, Duketon was shocked and looked down at the purple scratch, combined with his previous experience, which was associated with this scratch. It is indeed left by the way of embracing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Female Ghoul!? How could there be such a monster in the city?" Stephen was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug took a clap: "I said the ghoul is not the same as you think."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stop, Su Ge asked: "Do you want to know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Doesn't let my spirits skyrocket?" Du Ke tried to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The curiosity of human beings is never endless. Sometimes, even if you know the dangers ahead, you still can’t control your instinctive desire for knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge said casually: "That won't, but it's not suitable here. I need to wash my hands and talk to you about the passing and danger of the whole thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "It’s really fast!" Duke’s face was full of luck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Step by step, Stephen immediately said: "Please here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten minutes later, four The individual sits in a living room near the grounded window, and there is a jade coffee table in the middle of the soft leather sofa on both sides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time on the coffee table is a box of white sugar, milkshakes, and two dark, smelling golden lines of the bottle, and three high feet crystal glass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bottle of maid carefully opened the bottle and poured a clear white into the cup, like a liquid formed by frost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the advent of liquids, the whole room began to permeate a fragrant fragrance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please!" Duke made a gesture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what Duke said that he has just got the top blood wine, made with the blood of a unicorn, with magical effects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge and Sherry picked up the cup and watched the constant flow of the cup, like a frosty liquid smiled: "I always thought that blood and wine were Red."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Duke took a sip at the moment and enjoyed and enjoyed his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few seconds later, Duke smiled and explained: "Inferior blood wine is of course red, but higher blood wines are assimilated by higher blood." The effect of the higher blood is fully revealed. Like this blood wine, it looks exactly the same as the blood of the unicorn."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge shakes the cup But still not in a hurry, put it back on the table and said, "I like quiet enjoyment. Before that, I will simply say something about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Duke immediately put down the cup and said with a serious look: "You please say."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge leaned back on his chair and said easily: "The ghoul just said is a real monster in the system of vision. However, this monster has a special ability, called resistance. Sexual carapace. When they use this resistant carapace, they will become no different from normal people, and at the same time, they will be bound by the system."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" This kind of carapace has an absolute mysterious deception. If they don't show anything, they can't be seen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear This, Duketon was shocked and said: "Is there still such a monster?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, your uncle, the so-called beautiful woman met However, it is a ghoul that is draped in human skin to eat people and scary people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, Duqueton was pale and then tempted. Asked: "That... after that, isn't it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled and said: " With so much fear, these things are only a very small existence, many people can't see a ghoul in their lifetime."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear this, Duketon’s heart Slightly safe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he often looks for flowers outside, if Su Ge just said, then his future sexual life can be completely ruined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Stephen’s temptation asked: “Is there really no way?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, at least for you," Su Ge said earnestly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere suddenly calmed down and was a bit heavy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a dozen seconds, Duke asked: "What happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I just saw the weird blue flame of Su Ge's hands, and then the flames disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, Su Ge put his legs down and sat up and said: "This is also the trouble now. I just said that the symbol is the symbol of sacrifice. It means that your uncle was sacrificed to the goddess by the female ghoul. Your uncle was afraid because he was infected with the female ghoul and was infected with mystery, so he saw something that should not be seen. See the horror thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As you heard, someone wants to eat him. Who wants to eat him? I don't have to say more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, two people suddenly A pale white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His uncle is a sacrifice, who wants to eat a sacrifice? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nature is a god! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God..." Although Duke is unbelievers, the vocabulary is too powerful to keep his heart trembled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stephen’s temptation asks: “Then you...has you just dispelled the gods?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Su Ge couldn't help but smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are..." The two were surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled a few times and asked: "Do you think that the gods can be dispelled?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"........." Two people fell silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug said with a smile: "Let me re-set the concept of the gods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The name of the gods cannot be remembered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of the gods cannot be imitated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shape of the gods cannot be seen directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existence of the gods is indescribable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the face of real gods, touching any of these four, madness is a trivial matter, and the existence of your own whole person may be unspeakable. Horror variation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪嗒! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear this, the two people's visions have grown by two moments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a time, Duke’s attitude was a bit sluggish and he couldn’t return to God for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
