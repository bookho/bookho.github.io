			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear the words of the emperor, everyone’s heart is covered with a shadow, or a pressure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They instinctively want to kneel on the ground, instinctively worship the giant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are the leader of Byron Diaz?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking is the Holy Word . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice is similar to the sound of the giant's voice, his voice instantly removes the shadows of the people's hearts, and the clergymen suddenly change from the impulse of the majesty. The fighting spirit is high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This monster is the lord level. From the point of view, it is very good to be a secret profession: the emperor." 枭 seems to have special insight, very much at this time I quickly saw the career of the giant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Emperor!?" Hearing this, Laurie's face was a bit gloomy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor is indeed a very difficult and tricky profession, especially this kind of knowledge can have a self-conscious lord emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His own combat power may not be strong, but want to approach or attack him, it is simply an idiotic dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor has two core means, one is control and the other is deterrence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The means of domination can rule what he wants to rule, even an enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deterrence is similar to fear, greatly reducing the other's mental rationality, with the use of control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two methods look very monotonous and scarce, but they are ever-changing and unpredictable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the rumor, the founding emperors of the three great empires are actually mysterious, and they are all secrets of the emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Otherwise they can't control many forces in that chaotic condition, letting so many tyrannical surrender to themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant in the sky heard the words of the Holy Word, and the eyes on the left side turned slightly to look down at the ground, and the high indifference eyes gave an indescribable majesty and oppression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only one look, let a lot of priests breathe a sigh, pale, and want to squat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Looking down!" The Holy Word suddenly said loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were people who rushed back in time and dared to look down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge did not bow his head, his eyes were flat, but his vision shifted from the giant to the surrounding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bells slowly spread, and Su Ge found that there were at least five hundred monsters and dozens of spiritual parasites around them, all at all Preparation for the offense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Su Ge immediately went to Laurie and told him his intelligence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laurry flashed a dignified face and whispered, "How much do you know about these monsters?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The mental parasites can parasitize the human body and gain all the knowledge and abilities of their lives. They can even play for a long time. After they leave, they will directly eat the host's soul and become a spherical software. Monsters."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The monsters are made up of people, the scales of the body have a high mysterious resistance, the speed is very fast, the mouth can be ejected A liquid that pollutes the spirit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge quickly said the two monsters briefly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Laurie’s spirit was shocked and he said seriously: “This information is very important!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;After finishing, immediately tell the news to the 枭 and the sages, and pass the news quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Word has already started this battle with the emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people should be all professions in the language department. I heard you talking and talking. It looks like two people are screaming, but Su Ge can Clearly feel the horrible psionic power and the incitement of knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This place is the city of the king. It is the sacred land of our Byron Dias. Your faith is not worth mentioning here. You are isolated and helpless." The giant said faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, everyone feels gloomy, filled with fear and decadence, a sense of drift and helplessness that is like a grass without roots. whole body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacred face is slightly changed, but the tone is still firm and responsive: "Under the whole world, all in the glory of the goddess, up to the scorpio, down to hell As the land of the goddess, this is just a mirror that you have created. When the moon in March is spread over the earth, the moonlight will illuminate the road we are going. At that time, it is the day of destruction of the world. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to this, the clerics who were still desperately gloomy were immediately motivated and passionate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug stood aside and suddenly wanted to laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because these people are like students coming to the performance department, they perform different expressions according to the requirements of the two teachers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like changing a book, and it looks and looks like a lot of small meat in Su Ge’s impression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, laughing does not mean laughing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a bishop, this control power is still there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is only crazy in the spirit of his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The struggle between the two seems to be impossible to win. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face behind the giant's head has already produced annoyance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Intruders, you are all here today. Children, announce to the world, the rise of our Byron Dias!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the surrounding monsters rushed to the side in a rush. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge squeezed his cane and sneered: "Rise? The trolls and orcs who said this before have already entered the book."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking around at the monsters around, Su Ge sighed: "Don't say, it's really like a copy here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take him down!" With a low drink, the eyes suddenly slammed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, something that couldn’t be seen appeared, and the giant was shrouded in the middle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant body shrouded by the thing is as if it is imprisoned, and it does not move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time the attack on the ground hit the sky like a raindrop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hunting Bullets, Mithril Arrows, Spiritual Interference, Illusion, Curse, etc. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of this attack, the giant snorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咔嚓...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge clearly heard the cracking sound, and then the shackles Direct rupture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the rupture of the imprisonment, those who attacked the past, the distance from him was suddenly stopped and scattered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even invisible mental disturbances and illusions are dissipated by the confusion of the psionic sequence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this the emperor's prestige?" Moore whispered with a big eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giants in the sky turned slightly, and the wings flapped and gradually moved away, leaving only one sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Get up and fight back, then maybe you still have a chance to live."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With With the departure of the giant, the monsters that had been ruled by him all went crazy in an instant, and then the claws of the teeth rushed toward it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mental parasites lurking in the shadows of the surroundings jumped in an instant, like a flying worm that rushed from all directions to a priest who was clinging to a group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Array! Keep the formation!" Laurie screamed, and a thick dark moment burst out to form a protective cover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those mental parasites seem to have encountered a glass cover and cannot move on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;噗嗤...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a burst of steam, the outermost holy sword team pulls out the holy The sword, the huge sword with the roar, screamed in the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of all kinds of monsters, these players armed with holy swords, the body is neatly forward, the giant sword in the hands of the sword fell, suddenly swept forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood splatters, the internal organs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sharp and heavy sword easily cut the scales of these monsters, and a half-moon-shaped sword light cut off at least three monsters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, these sacred swords armed with swords, the body first stepped back, then suddenly turned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cut off more monsters again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the sages standing in the middle of the crowd said loudly: "The claws of the bloodmoon goddess are armed with our swords!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, everyone’s weapon suddenly appeared a layer of blood, feeling extra lightness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The wings of the goddess of the moon gives us brilliance!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a layer on everyone The milky white light feels full of power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The wisdom of the Purple Moon Goddess gives us mystery!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, everyone has discovered it, His own psionic power suddenly increased by 30%<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge feels the light in his body, and there is a deep feeling of just taking the potion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s very powerful and the state is never bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be careful with the jet attack!" Sapir in front of him slammed a few monsters and screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, the surrounding monsters opened their mouths, and a disgusting yellow thick water sprayed here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because there are too many people, it is impossible for everyone to dodge the attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But what surprised Su Ge was that the yellow water did not cause any harm when it was splashed on people, just the physical The milky white light is slightly weaker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the pure white light will neutralize the disgusting concentrated water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this, Su Ge’s heart was amazed. He thought that white light was only a small blessing to enhance the physical activity. Now, there is actually a psionic power. Shield related effects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seeing that the jet attack was ineffective, many of the Holy Swords and clergymen suddenly dared to zoom in a lot, carrying a bloody weapon, a group of several people, such as The wolf kills these monsters like a tiger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weapon that covers red light is much sharper than the original, and has an indescribable corrosive power. After cutting on these monsters, it is as smooth and sour. The wounds eroded their bodies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugly looked awe at the usual words of the Holy Word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This archbishop is, in his opinion, more important than the combination of Laurie and 枭. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because his assistive ability is really terrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a very desperate situation, with the help of the Word of the Holy Word, the Holy Swords, the Demon Hunter, and the Sinners matched each other, and they quickly The first monsters were wiped out, only two clerics were sacrificed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the side, there are dozens of black spheres in the hands of Laurie. If you look closely, you can see that there is a spiritual parasite in each ball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He actually used his dark knowledge to imprison these things in the dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, blinking eyes and sweeping a few times suddenly said: "Here, the exit is here!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking her finger to the dilapidated church in the middle of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Raise toward the church quickly!" Laurie shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, the Dark Star, Sapir, and Moore led the clergy to open the way in front, and the team marched quickly along the dirty, messy, dark and strange streets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The process of moving forward is naturally not very smooth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because at this time, more mad descendants and spiritual parasites emerged from this dilapidated city in all directions, quickly surrounding them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although these monsters are very scary and difficult, the face of the three lords of the archbishop is still a little weak at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team is struggling to advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge mixed in the team, can fish in the fish, so he waved two canes in a few days, released a few nights, so mixed up . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shuge is not happy when he looks at the team that is all the best. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not that he doesn’t want to go out, but he feels it’s a bit too unusual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, it’s impossible for the giant to put them in and let them leave again. It’s perfect to die here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the strength of the giant, Su Ge estimates that he can easily suppress the three archbishops at the same time, gaining time and attack opportunities for these monsters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the giant said two words and left. Although the offensive here is fierce, it seems to be a little too simple in Su Ge, and the situation in the city is completely different from the environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What the hell is going on, is there any other situation?" Su Ge's brain turned quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he thought of Sherry’s reminder of himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be careful with your feet and stones."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Su Geton was in a stiff body and hurriedly looked down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bow does not matter, Su Ge’s spirit has risen a bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he bowed his head, he saw a cold, gloomy green eye from the gap between the jagged bricks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This eye is in the moment of confrontation with Su Ge, and the next second flashes and disappears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge knows that what he sees is not an illusion, and this growing vision is the key. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is that? What is there under the city!" Su Ge was nervous at this moment, and his palm slowly squeezed his cane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only the city on the side of the table, but also on the side of the city on the side of the city, the night afternoon of Su Ge still can't feel anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Would you like to tell them? Telling me is not good for me, and even causing some suspicion. If you don't tell it? If they can't go out, I It’s dangerous, emmm... let’s tell, let’s go out from this ghost place.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking, Su Ge stepped up and stepped forward to prepare for these The news was told to the three bishops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But when Su Ge didn't take two steps, Su Ge suddenly felt a violent squirm on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fast! The exit is close at hand!" Sapir excitedly shouted in front of him, cheering on many people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, after more than an hour of fighting, the people were less than two hundred meters away from the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind them, blood and corpses are everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And these clergymen have already died by almost fifty people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be careful!" Su Ge suddenly screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it’s still late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the whole ground fluctuated like a wave, and everyone standing on it was completely unstable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn! What a ghost thing!" Many clergymen screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug does not know what it is at this time. He has two feet in the middle of the two bricks, trying to stabilize his body. At this time, Su Ge gradually felt that the entire street had become a horrible monster, and even the surrounding buildings began to squirm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be careful!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the ground suddenly rises suddenly, like a huge wave of rough waves It is like a dragon that is still awake under the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many clergymen were taken high by this sudden bulge and then directly thrown down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, people found that under the bricks on the ground, there is such a strange body like a mud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bricks stick to it like its scales. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the mud-like body continually twisted, making the whole city alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Run! Is the repairs!" Laurie seemed to think of something, and suddenly screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Repair...Surges!?" Many clerics were shocked when they heard this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shuges is a four-sequence Dai who needs to be seen at 42 points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the record, the singer is a horrible, powerful, horrible, and horrible Yi who cannot be killed by known methods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the book, they have a nightmare-like black and bright body, and the amorphous body emits a stench, squirming forward, flowing... A bunch of amorphous protoplasmic blister, flashing a vague gleam. Tens of thousands of pus-like eyes continue to form and decompose on its surface. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger suddenly thought: "The stench is not from the bodies, but from the repairs that are hiding below the ground." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the repairs have been fully revealed, and Suge can't see how big his body is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black-skinned body has inexhaustible eyes, and the scalp is numb and the heart trembles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嘎嘎嘎...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a harsh voice, its muddy body Three clergymen have been swallowed up slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't! Don't! Help! Help!" The three clerics screamed and felt that their bodies were constantly being swallowed, with unspeakable faces on their faces. Fear and despair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They continue to mourn and plead, and want a powerful bishop to save them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the three archbishops did not take a look and said aloud: "Run! Run! Don't worry about anyone! Run!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loudly speaking, the three archbishops only protected some of the close clerics beside them, and quickly stepped on the side of the house and rushed out toward the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嘎嘎嘎嘎...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the harsh sound coming out, everyone feels more than just The streets are alive and the whole city is alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The numerous black mud-like tentacles extend from all the surrounding ruins, crevices, windows, doors, and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the blink of an eye, the city just like hell has turned into a horrible cannibal monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The whole city was built on the body of Hugues!" Moore whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turns out! It turns out! This is why he is so relieved to leave. We can't run out! Because there are such horrible monsters!" The staff is full of desperate thoughts at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, the earth shakes and the sky collapses, just like the whole world has collapsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The violent shaking of dizziness makes people even have no thoughts on how to escape, and then life is death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger is now lightly stepping on the bricks in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the core of such ability is not how strong his body is, but the black cloak that he is hunting behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Su Ge followed the three archbishops and ran towards the church, there were a lot of tentacles around the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These tentacles then linked to each other, quickly entangled the broken church in the middle, and then like to gradually tighten the rope, twisting the entire church into a ruin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's over!" Seeing this scene, many clergymen immediately paled and lost their last hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is still calm, just thinking about the countermeasures in his mind, I feel a violent turn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up and everyone was terrified to find that the entire city began to distort sharply at this moment, and then the city seemed like a huge monster suddenly turned over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, everyone feels fearful that they have become free fall and fall down quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sugg turned his head and found that the sky had now turned into a blood red abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time the abyss is full of monsters, mutated humans, twisted buildings, and small dwarfs, and huge in size over a hundred meters. insect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey! Hey! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two consecutive sounds, Su Ge’s spiritual vision rose directly from 42 to 45. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fear of uncontrollable fear filled his heart, making his spirit tremble and uneasy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the night of the town sounded, and Suger’s heart was quiet and quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others can be so lucky without Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, at least ten clerics at his side made a scream of screaming, out of control and going crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black hair then grows out of their skin and becomes a sly monster between the blinks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black cloak hunting began, Su Ge immediately stopped falling and stopped in midair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Suge was ready to look at the situation, he felt the light on his head getting darker and darker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking up, a dark, eye-catching mountain descended from the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn! Hugues flipped the city over and tried to keep us underneath!" Su Ge thought of its plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, this gusgus is too big, and Sug can't see the margin when he looks at it. It has completely blocked the entire upper part. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug bites his teeth and looks helplessly abandoning the flying ability of the cloak and begins to fall freely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you fall, there may be hopes of being alive, being contacted by this singer, and you can thoroughly lick your fart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Su Ge joined the fall and began to fall quickly into the bloody abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
