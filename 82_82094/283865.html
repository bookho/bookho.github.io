			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, the chief of staff should be very tired when you return. You should take a break, take a bath, change your clothes, and then sleep well." Feeling." Vanas seemed to think of something in front of the living room before, suddenly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illina is also very tired, directly agreeing to say: "Thank you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This time the chief of staff has made great achievements. I will reward you when you have a good rest." Vanas said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you!" After Elena’s slight salute, she pointed to Su Ge and said, “Since I brought him over, let him temporarily Stay with me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How can that be!" Vanas said immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, she seems to feel wrong, immediately explained: "Your manor is a girl, you suddenly live in a man seems not very convenient And don't forget the warning from Grandpa Mill."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Elena nodded: "Well, I am not thinking about it." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas leaned over and hugged her shoulder and said, "And you think about it for me, the grand palace can’t receive a guest, and let The guest lives with you. Does this seem to make our royal family too stingy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illina heard this and nodded, turning her head to Su Ge Say: "Feel the mercy and grace of our Queen, and then accept it with gratitude!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled and saluted: "Reassured, the chief of staff!" After br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that, Elena stepped away from here and returned to her home to rest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Elena left, there were five people in the corridor, Vanas, Su Ge, and two men and two women. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blond handsome guy is staring at Su Ge at this moment with a bad look, faintly stepping forward to Vanas, and ready to attack at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas said with sincerity: "Thank you again for saving me Elena. She is not only my chief of staff, but also my good sister."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Suge’s elegant and steady smile, body salute: “It’s hard to raise your hand, but it’s not enough to hang your teeth. But it’s really grateful to Yulin for my reception today. I can get the personal reception and serious talk of Queen Guinness, who is known as the Pearl of the North. This is my greatest honor in the past few years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Su Ge’s courtesy, no ambiguous words, standard posture, elegant and calm smile, Vanas feels like a piece of art in his heart, and is very pleasing to the eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Sotos is tired of estimating all the way, I will let Mary take the gentleman to take a break!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maria, take Mr. Sotos to the east side of Yaoyang room to rest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear these three bodyguards Suddenly shocked, even Maria was also shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rooms in the Imperial Palace are divided into three levels, including Stars, Silver Moon and Yaoyang. Among them, Yaoyang ranks the highest. There are only four things from north to south, which are used to entertain other The king or politician who came to visit the country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Dong Yaoyang House is close to the Queen’s Palace, which has always been the place where the most intimate lords can live. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The handsome blond man said in a hurry: "Your Majesty, there is a place where the king of the kingdom has always lived, where is his businessman who is full of copper smell and is eligible to live there. I want to say that he doesn't even have the qualification to live in the Star House!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jimmy, you seem to be too rude today." Vanas did not return. Said faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The handsome blond man suddenly breathed a sigh of relief when he heard this, and his face turned pale and pale: "It’s wrong."<br /><br />&nbsp Maria was very pertinent at this time: "Your Majesty, I know your gratitude and value to Mr. Sotos, but according to the royal regulations, civilians are indeed not eligible to enter the Yaoyang Room." I want to live in at least the Marquis, or the character of the big church bishop."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, Vaneston was caught in a dilemma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge’s eyes flashed, and she used a hidden look at her, indicating that she did not have to hide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you see this, the smart Vanas immediately grasps the truth and asks: "Do you really think he is just a businessman?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Four people heard this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Vanas continued to ask: "Do you really think that I am already in a state of faintness, need you to remind the importance of Yaoyang room?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want to kneel..." Maria's hesitant temptation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas has a bit of a down tone, with a hint of disappointment: "I thought you followed me for so long, you can understand what I mean, it seems that I The expectation for you may be too high."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four people heard this in their hearts, and the whole person was extremely uncomfortable, like a student who had just been finished by the boss. I feel the future is gray. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Sotos, say your identity and your intentions, and come up with your documents, please forgive the loyalty of my servants, now in extraordinary times, They may be too sensitive," Vanas said in a positive color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s nod to her satisfaction, then her hands on the chest, with a peaceful and solemn expression: “Let me introduce myself again” A moment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Su Ge from the temperament, Maria and Jimmy suddenly looked a little surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My name is Suger Sotos, the bishop of the Holy Blood Church, and this time I came to the church's central archbishop: the command of Archbishop Emilia, and Kyrgyzstan. The Queen of Nice is negotiating and hopes that our church can help your country deal with the issue of the rebel party and further explore the future development of friendly peace between the two countries."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Holy Blood Church!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Trainee Bishop!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
