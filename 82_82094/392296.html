			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After two people talked to each other for a while, Emilia took Suge out of the palace and strolled in the secluded garden. She said, "You How much do you know about the structure and system of the whole church now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge thought: "There is not much understanding, bishop, archbishop, central archbishop, holy sword The team, there are also gods, patrols, hunters, and so on. It’s quite scattered.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emilia’s nice voice with a smile Meaning: "It’s all bishops. I’m not familiar with the structure of the church. It’s a joke when I go out.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is a little embarrassed, respectful Said: "Also ask the Archbishop to educate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I will say roughly, you are not an outsider, you should know the details of some churches."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will say from the top down. The top of the church is naturally the leader of the entire church, the Pope, only second The Pope is the three saints, known as the Three Holy. Sansheng respectively leads the Holy Sword, the Hymn, and the ruling, which is the backbone of the entire church structure."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sansheng..." Su Ge also heard the name for the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Under the Three Saints is our 12th Central Archbishop, the Central Archbishop is the core staff of the Church of the Pope, and each Central Archbishop has a fixed The parish, such as my parish, is the entire northeastern province. Outside the central archbishop are ordinary archbishops who do not have a parish. These people are generally the masses in the church. As the person in charge of the emergency, they are usually more leisurely, just like you. The familiar Archbishop Jelos."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Under the Archbishop, you are usually a regional bishop, each responsible for a city's Holy Blood Church. The overall hierarchy It's not very complicated."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge nodded and said clearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emilia continues to say: "Let's talk about the different agencies under these frameworks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"The sacred choir is a group under the sacred sacred sacred sect. The people in it are devout believers who have devout faith and can be blessed by the goddess of March. These people are generally not married for the rest of their lives. Everything is dedicated to the goddess, with the goddess of singing as a lifelong mission. Every time the saints are chosen from the hymns."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The following verses include three organs: the exorcist, responsible for the treatment of the lowest-level monsters, and helping the civilians to exorcise; the sacred priests are mainly responsible for expelling curses for civilians, appease the soul, pray for purification, and can also handle some intermediate monsters. Finally, it is the agent of the sacred month, dealing with advanced monsters, and is responsible for medical treatment, blood therapy, delivery, and protection of weak women."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" As the army of the purple moon saints, the people who have the devout faith also have the understanding of science and technology and the mysterious affinity. They can easily shred the enemy by using mysterious and huge mechanical swords. And expeditions, the elimination of cults, and those huge monsters, known as the church's expeditionary army."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Holy Spirit team includes three organs: God punishment Responsible for the handling of the lowest level of magic, to protect the safety of the people, to have the right to pursue the search for monsters; Hunter: relatively free, responsible for handling all kinds of monsters, and long-distance tracking and hunting. After that, it is the purple moon substitute, that is, your previous occupation, responsible for the investigation and pursuit of the mysterious situation of the whole city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The ruling is the bloody saints Most of the people in charge of the judiciary are private law, generally much colder than others, and they don’t talk about their feelings. They not only deal with those who are filthy, smash the church, but also monitor the church at all times. The internal situation, and often use the dark and bloody means to achieve the purpose, even if it is very little for others, is called the death in the church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" There are four kinds of organs under the ruling system: the most common one is the night watchman, responsible for the safety of the entire city at night, and monitoring the situation of the whole city through special means."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Upon hearing this, Su Ge immediately thought of Rogan’s crow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After the night watcher is the arbiter, you can be understood as a group of executioners, they are specialized in dealing with some prisoners and traitors, you will want to go The third is the Blood Knight, who is an elite minority force that specializes in dealing with unexpected things, or hiding things in the dark and bringing people back to the arbiter." Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The last bloody moonwalker, the guy is a butcher, and they are usually sent out, all facing extreme events that kill all witnesses. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The ten heads of the three agencies responsible for these ten institutions are called the same as our archbishops, but they rarely involve decision-making and political aspects, mainly dealing with mysterious aspects."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Holy Blood Church in each region will give some allocations to these institutions. According to the size of the city, the type and number of deployment agencies will be assigned to the regional bishops for deployment."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is these people all uniformly deployed by the Holy See?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emilia nodded slightly and said with deep meaning: "Of course, the Holy See will listen more to the advice of our Central Archbishop."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Su Geton was at a glance, and his heart was relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Emilia's tone with a special wave of volatility, with a lovely voice of a slight nasal sound became official. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Beyond these conventional systems, we have two special organizations that are independent of the system."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear this, Sugton erects his ears, looks serious and listens attentively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emeria is very satisfied with Su Ge’s attitude and continues to explain: “The first of these is the Holy Blood Maze.”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Holy Blood Maze, finally reached out." Su Ge's heart beat slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Holy Blood Maze is one of the core secrets of our church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge tempted Q: "Is the legends of the outside world true?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are real and false, after all, there are many people who have knowledgeed our maze for many years."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where is the Holy Blood Maze?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The labyrinth is the birthplace of blood therapy, It is the research and development center of the church mystery and technology, where we found a lot of new knowledge that we have never had.” Referring to the labyrinth of the Holy Blood, Emilia’s face is longing for. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge heard this indulge, and he tempted to ask: "The Archbishop, according to "Three Nights Before Creation," introduced, is this maze..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Your reaction is very fast, right. This maze is the dungeon maze that imprisons the body of the ancient demon." Emilia looked with approval. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But the goddess does not want humans to come into contact with those demons."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emilia face band The lofty pride and glorious explanation: "Yes, the goddess does not want. But we are not ordinary human beings, we are the goddess of the goddess and believers. The labyrinth hidden underground will soon be discovered by ordinary people. And we are As a servant of the goddess, it is natural to take care of this maze in advance and prevent ordinary people from coming into contact with Him. Because all human beings can only resist the temptation of the ancient demon body."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is in a state of mind: "It turns out to be."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Holy Blood Maze is a very dangerous and strange existence, the ancient demon, Even the remains of the dead body have powerful powers that cannot be understood and explained. We have been seeking to decipher the secrets of the ancient demon corpse for many years and look for the truth. However, with generation after generation, countless ancestors died and sacrificed. There is no progress."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What later?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Later we discovered a human, that kind of human will produce some mutations It becomes a special existence, and the root cause of that kind of human variation is caused by parasites emanating from ancient corpses. When the two are in close contact, they can produce some special resonance."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Witch!?" Su Ge was shocked and his eyes gradually widened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Emilia’s righteous nod: “Yes, the witch. The ancient demons are very evil. The parasites will only pick the pure and kind heart, the beautiful girl. Parasitic, the purpose is to let us kill each other and kill all the really kind people in this way. Fortunately, we have seen through his tricks. In recent years, we have been hunting witches not to kill them. But want to bring them back to the holy blood maze and cure them. Because the sarcomas are very strange, if they are too far away from their mother, a slight change will become a monster, but in the maze, we can easily pick Lower sarcoma without causing any variation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
