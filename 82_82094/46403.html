			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ps: almost the beginning, starting the official story)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looks at Black's excitement The look, the heart is gratified at the same time, the face said strangely: "Black, you don't want to be excited. I just said it casually, it is said."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black double The eyes flashed and said: "Suge, although you didn't mean to say it casually, it gave me important inspiration. I seem to have found a way to improve it. You should eat it first, I want to understand it. So If the important inspiration is missed, I will regret it for a lifetime."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge grinned and continued to eat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Winnie is very concerned about her brother's body, she does not stop it. She likes literature very well, and some important inspirations are hard to come by. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am going to work in the library, do you have any activities?" Wennie asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The money at home has completely bottomed out, and Winnie has found a new part-time job. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge heard some distressed, swallowed the bread and said, "I will try to find some part-time jobs when I go down."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wennie squinted her fingers: "I am going to be the festival of the moon, we need to pay some money to buy some new clothes to attend the holiday banquet, but also to buy some meat to prepare the holiday food, or wear a weekday The dress in the dress will be secretly snickered by the neighbors."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We can't afford the finished clothes, we can buy the fabric first, I recently saw a new type of The fabric is made of cotton and linen, and the price is not expensive. The clothes of the three of us are almost 1 lang. It is enough to go to the lady of Gilsey in the fruit street to make clothes. I will talk about it by hand. 80 cents is enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Compared with food, our family's spices are gone, recently entered the winter, although the meat has some price drops, but the spices It’s very strong. We need to make food for three people for two days, about two francs, and the house needs cloth. Look..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard Winnie’s calculation, Su Ge found that his family’s financial situation was much worse than he thought, because he forgot the Moon Festival. Things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a big holiday once a year, it is January 1 of every year. Similar to the Spring Festival of the Earth, the customs are similar, wearing new clothes, eating delicious, and the lights are very busy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge said here: "You don't have to be too tired. I have performed very well recently and can even pay a month's salary. This money is enough for us to spend the holidays. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sug, you should save a little money for yourself, otherwise you will not be able to afford the flowers in the future." Winnie Said directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Family’s spending, Su Ge is not Winnie, because People are accounting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After lunch, Wennie got dressed and left in a hurry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge was not idle, put on his old black suit and hat, and picked up his cane and went out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can now use the second skill of the priest and meditate. This should help some people to stabilize their spirits, and should find some work!" Thinking about it, follow the Pearl Street at the door of the police station to the talent market near the city center. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking on a wide street, Sug looked at the buildings on both sides. His pace is very slow, his eyes are looking around with his appreciation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When I came to this world for so long, I haven’t relaxed to take a good look at the world." Su Ge looked at the sky. Qingyan sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through this street corner, Suger heard a quarrel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I turned around, I saw a black coat with a suitcase in my hand and what the young man was talking to a bakery owner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, it is a pity that the two men are red-faced because of language barriers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is the League of Nations? Is it a union?" Su Ge had some surprises. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Union Empire is one of the three major empires of today, located in the southwest of the entire continent, separated by dozens of Principality from the Berant Empire in the northeast of the mainland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the relationship between the two countries is good, because the state religion of the League of Legends is the Nighthawk Church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nighthawk Church is the origin of the world's hunters, and, like the Church of the Holy Blood, is a branch that has been separated from Kabatos College. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the two people who are about to fight, Su Ge is also a half-policeman. He quickly stepped forward and said in the words of the League: "Sir, please don't misunderstand, He doesn't give you money, but he can't find it for a while. He hopes that you can wait a moment, he goes to the next door for some change."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This big windbreaker The young man heard a glimpse. Like a savior, he said with gratitude: "Thanks to the goddess, kind and kind gentleman, please help me translate it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The fat boss of the bakery here looked at Su Ge and then accidentally said: "Sotos priest?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled and nodded and said: " It’s me, Mr. Parker.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bakery owner Parker and Su Ge have a good relationship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge checked his bakery when he checked the street a few days ago. At that time his little daughter was frightened, and Su Ge used the meditation to help the little girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parker was very grateful and invited him to eat a soft white bread covered with cream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The then very hungry Sugton felt the most delicious food after coming to the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Parker, you should go find the money first, I will have some agreement, I will help you to stabilize him." Su Ge said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parker was grateful after listening, holding the money and ran to the next door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The misunderstanding between the two people is very simple. The young man buys a piece of bread with a face value of 10 ng. It may be too hungry. eat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
