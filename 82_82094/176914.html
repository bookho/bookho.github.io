			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Department of Logistics, Su Ge handed over the completed form and waited for equipment such as Rays. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nun behind the counter took the form and looked at it with some surprises. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge squinted and asked: "What's wrong? Sister Rille?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This nun is a clergyman who entered the church with Su Ge in the same batch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her family is poor, her parents died early, and she grew up in a church welfare home, so she is a devout believer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of her kind and hardworking character, and her firm belief, she has successfully become the nun of the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two people who met during the training of the training field, although the functions vary greatly, but as a person of the same period, there is only a lot of closeness between each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young Sister Julie smiled and said: "I thought you were going to apply for a potion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"?? What do I apply for the potion?" Su Ge looked at the question mark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sister Julie squirmed and spit out her tongue and said, "I heard other clergymen say that you are a half-hunter, you can get it from the potion." Power, the last time because of the power of the potion, was rescued by Father Hank."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...The people of this church are so good at making stories, to rumor? Su Ge’s face was speechless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Julie tempted to ask: "Sotos priest, are you a hunter?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp Su Ge’s heart came to the interest, the elbows leaned on the counter, his face was tense and indifferent, and he learned the hoarse voice of Gerlos’s hoarse voice: “How? Want to come to me with a Kunte card? "Surrier Sister smiled and knew that Sug was joking, but still confidently said: "My squirrel party is invincible!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finished, with a trace of pride on his face, turned and walked in to get things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge waiting at the counter is not idle, thinking in his heart Just the words of Rogan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A person like Mr. Logan doesn't talk nonsense, so what does this mean?" Su Ge thought in his mind and began to combine his own mind. Knowledge about potions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a moment, Su Ge suddenly thought: "Is it really possible to use potions in the future?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The potion is an outstanding product, but it has a strong toxin. In the five thousand years that this potion has been popularized, only the demon can use the effect of the potion to the extreme. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why Hunter can be one of the most comprehensive and versatile mysterious professions, because they can deal with different monsters according to different potions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With the rise of the mysterious profession, the versatility of potions has been significantly improved, and at the same time, some weakened versions of potions can be improved. Some other mysterious professions are used, provided that the profession has a strong body and strong control over the body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Having a strong control over the body, By temporarily controlling the body's organs and muscles, the toxins invade the vital organs of the body, and even the toxins can be isolated in the stomach, and can be sent out directly with the debris without infiltrating into the blood."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the knowledge that Su Ge has recently obtained from the book about the potions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, during the training process, the instructor who is an expert fighter also demonstrated how to use some low-toxin toxins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Su Ge’s heart suddenly became clear: “If this is the case, can I analyze my body through the mind of the gods and let me strengthen my body? Control, or through the refinement of the knowledge of the potion, use the mind to resolve the potion, remove the toxic substances, and become an enhancer without side effects?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If this is the case, can I lead the transformation of the whole world!" Suddenly, Su Ge’s imaginative imagination went on, and he unconsciously thought that he should be the king of the opposite world, known as the king of potions. Wan Guan Jia Cai, lived a supreme luxury of high life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sotos priest! Sotos priest!" In the happy yy of Su Ge, the voice of the nun was heard in the ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge blinked his eyes and saw Sister Julie looking at herself with concern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you okay?" asked Sister Julie to put down the box in her hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course nothing, I just had any questions?" Su Ge took the box and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Julie whispered: "You have just had some eyes blurred, your mouth is rising wildly, and you seem to be thinking about something evil."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough...Young nun, that is not an evil thing. I have just rescued the innocent people of the three goddesses and are relishing the happiness and happiness of saving others. Su Ge checks the amount, and slaps Hu Zou. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Julie was shocked and looked down: "Sin, it’s a sin! Your heroic deeds have been widely circulated among us. I actually think it is Sorry for the pollution you are so pure."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge softly smiled and said something: "It doesn't matter, little distracting thoughts are irrelevant, important It is the sincerity of the heart."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sister Julie heard the hard nod and blessed: "May the goddess be with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"May the goddess be with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Take the box back to his Ziyue Chapel and find a letter at the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug had some accidents, opened the letter and looked at it. The content was written by the guard of the Church of the Holy Blood. The content is very simple. Ada asked him to go home to eat at night. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge listened to his heart warmly, took the letter and walked into the church to begin the final preparation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take off the dress that will tighten the body, and Sug put on a silk shirt that is well-dressed and put on a fleece woven from the mysterious black goat's wool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lower body is wearing tight-leg pants and boots that are easy to fight, tighten the belt, put two small pockets on the back waist, and put silver powder inside. , tiger blood medicine and Lei Fu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hunter pistol with the blood and silver bullets is placed on the left leg, and finally put on his blue priest robes and hang the shawl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Activate your body, very comfortable and comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The small bottle of silver blood is fixed on the wristband. When used, the weapon can instantly cut the rubber bottle and apply the medicine to the weapon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Sug put down his cane and replaced it with a mysterious weapon made of a mixture of silver and steel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything is ready, Su Ge lie down into meditation, recovering the psionic power while waiting for the arrival of the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time is slowly passing, the sun is going down, and March is rising. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! Boom! ......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With six heavy and distant bells, the nightfall is announced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dimly lit bedroom, Sug opened his eyes, put the silver steel dagger behind his waist, and once again determined that his equipment had no problem and then walked out quietly. church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just out of the door, Su Ge heard a crisp ringtone, and under the dim light, several faint shadows wandered in the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go!" Rogan, who took the lead, raised his head slightly, and the big hat squatted under his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge took a deep breath and nodded hard to go to Logan: "I feel that there will be a fierce battle today."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
