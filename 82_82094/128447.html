			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, Su Ge still got up early and took him to the morning exercise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I got home, I found that Ada also got up very early. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How did you get up so early today?" Su Ge looked curious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aida prepared for breakfast and said: "Today, I started to gather the tramps and I am going to make arrangements. I have to maintain the order of the scene earlier." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge suddenly nodded: "Where is the tramp?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One of the north of the city The farm, the city government has already talked with the farmer." Ada said freely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;! ! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing the farm in the north of the city, Su Ge couldn’t help but jump: "Which circus?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, the next door, about five meters from that." Ada's voice came out of the kitchen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Su Ge scratched his head with some irritability. At this moment, he found that things were not that simple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "According to Bart's intelligence, the Green Flame Brotherhood is here to be invited, so that means they are there, or there are traitors among us." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Through the operation of the city government, the tramp was placed there at this festival. At the same time, the most powerful of the Holy See was transferred through the Holy See. Master Gerlos, the traitor has more energy than I imagined. It can even be said that his power in Bain exceeds Bart."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes Who has this ability?" Su Ge thought about it, and his personal appearance appeared in his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One is the Archbishop of the Church of the Holy Blood, Ron, and the other is the mayor of the city, Arnold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The two of them have the most doubts." Su Ge was more suspicious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The matter of Gerlos last night opened a gap in Su Ge’s heart, that is, the Church of the Holy Blood, who has always been united in Su Ge’s cognition and Not as indestructible as it seems, and united. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If before, Su Ge would not doubt the benevolent Ron Archbishop, but it is different now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But there is no evidence yet, and it is possible that some people deliberately directed the attention of people like me to Bishop Ron and A. Mayor of Novo."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking for a long time, Suge returned to God in Ada’s call. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ada, can you not go today?" Su Ge asked seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ada smiled and said, "How can I not go? I am the initiator, and I can see that the tramp can get a warm home. I am very inside." I am happy, I feel that my spirit has reached a perfection."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The palm of the hand under the Su Ge table is slowly tightening, he knows that he can't stop Ada, the simple analysis in his heart After that, the posture returned to normal and said: "That should pay attention to safety. If something goes wrong, go directly to the Marlene Sister on the side."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ada seems I really liked to touch Su Ge’s head. I reached out and touched Su Ge’s head and said, “I know, kind little guy.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The group of people should not be rashly launched now. If they want to be completely successful, they must be fully prepared. When I am here and the mysterious person determines the situation, I will go to Ida immediately, for a total of three or four hours. It should be completely done! The time will be relatively adequate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think of this Grid heart slightly wider, even after dinner did not go to the police station, but directly went to Kazakhstan with two oak mansion located in the city's east side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hidden existence gave Sugg a crisis of trust, and now he sees everyone like the mysterious black hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distance from the west of the city to the east of the city is very far, and it takes an hour to take a steam locomotive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When walking to the Oak House, the time is already 8:50. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Oak Mansion is a very high-end rich man’s residence throughout Bain, where most of the houses are single-family villas,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The overall style is very beautiful, most of them are white walls, the four-storey duplex, surrounded by a courtyard with a very wooden fence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the white wall, the exquisite relief on the eaves, Su Ge’s envious face sighed: "When can I live in such a house?"中?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “My previous home was better than these houses.” Bernice’s mature and calm voice came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug turned to look and found that both Hills and Bernice were dressed in plush coats, wearing plain blue sweaters and tights. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although wearing plain, but with two people's beautiful face, it gives a very amazing visual impact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Apostle!" The two men were slightly stunned and respected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of respect is from the heart, for the gods, they have worship and fanaticism. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are respect and loyalty to the apostles of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded and said: "This title is not to be called in front of others. Our current relationship can be counted as a friend relationship. You directly call me. The name doesn't need to be salute. It's too weird to look at others."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people have knowledge of common sense, and nodded after hearing it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Gerlos left, Suge felt that the mountain on his head had disappeared, and his contact with the witch was not to be as violent as before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The next step we will face is a mysterious person. I may need your help at that time." Su Ge said seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two men nodded solemnly and said: "You can rest assured that as long as we are alive, your life will have an absolute guarantee."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yesterday in the dream of the Lord's messenger has said that the apostle is the embodiment of the Lord in the human world, symbolizing the dignity of the Lord in the human world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the three people, they went to the gate of the mansion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After not entering the door, they were stopped by the security guard at the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who are you? Do you know where it is?" The big waist was wearing a cotton coat, and the security guard holding the baton asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge responded by saying, "We are looking for Mrs. Michelle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Security A glimpse, then asked: "What is your name?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sug Sotos."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The security guard carefully looked at Su Ge, then looked at the two beautiful women behind Su Ge, and nodded slightly and said: "Go forward through the three rows of houses, the second side of the left side of the left side of the road That is, Mrs. Michel is waiting for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge sighed: "The arrangement of Master Geros is really thoughtful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the door, Su Ge looked at the neat ground and the houses on the side, and suddenly thought: "Is this Mrs. Michelle a lover of Master Gerald?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Su Geton remembered when he was investigating the embarrassment of the death sect about ten days ago, the ones that the ladies looked at were the wolves. Eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s good to be handsome." Su Ge thought that he touched his face and sighed: "I hope that this life will not be lonely forever."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking in the heart, three people have stood in front of a black iron gate that is eight meters wide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
