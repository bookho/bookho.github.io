			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What the hell are you!?" Who is Su Ge, Laurie is very clear. What he didn't know at this time was what this guy was! Or what kind of existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger is now manifested by the average person can not perceive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, that phenomenon is a real existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the legend, divine grace is the gift of the gods to the cleansers of the world, because the cleansers are true believers, while others are thieves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The source is derived from the fifth chapter of the fifth chapter of the Three Nights before the Creation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gods opened up the world, the gods created the species, and the greatness of the gods covered the earth like the sky, spreading knowledge and nurture all things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, humans awakened the greed of the original sin, they plundered the knowledge of the gods, took possession of themselves, and regarded it as their own power, arguing that everything has nothing to do with the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These people are eternal thieves, even if they are dead, their sons, grandchildren, sons and grandsons will endure this imprint forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, people are born with sin, people are born to be thieves, and people should be forgiven by nature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the case, there will be such a pure person, this person is the hope of the world, the last cleansing of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is pure and innocent, he may have been filthy, but he has an innocent spirit and supreme will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He repaid everything to God, so God forgave him and bless him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How can humans complete self-salvation! How can humans repay everything to God!? This is impossible!" Laurie clenched his fists, clenching his teeth and whispering Road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Human beings are a part of mystery. Anyone has the qualification to enter mystery. Anyone is a very high-level mystery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In theory, as long as people do not die, it is impossible to repay everything. It is impossible to complete the redemption of the self and obtain the true grace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at this moment, the impossible existence was met in a way that he least wanted to meet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Repayment, itself is a kind of salvation, a kind of tranquility, a kind of oneness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, the mysterious dispersal of Su Ge has lost everything, and even the body can no longer enter the mystery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he hunted in such a crazy way, his own body repaid everything! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stolen knowledge is fully repaid, and he naturally gets the shelter of the gods and grace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the meaning of the most contradictory sentence in Su Ge’s sentence. I am the weakest at this time, but also the strongest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also his calm capital. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t have any offensiveness himself, and he couldn’t even touch Laurie’s clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if you come to an ordinary strong policeman, he can’t beat it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the case. At this moment, no one dares to rush to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one knows what it is, but everyone feels a cold pressure, like countless souls staring at themselves in all directions, let them only I dare not have any thoughts of hostility to Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When there is bad hostility, they feel that the soul with cold resentment will tear them apart in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not an illusion, but a warning given to them by inspiration! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of Laurie’s questioning, Su Ge calmly replied: “As you can see, a normal person can’t be ordinary! An incompetent can’t be incompetent. People!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two sentences will be very heavy. Because Su Ge knows that no matter what he has experienced, no matter where he is, no matter who he is, whether he is called Suger Sotos, is it the clock of the church of the late bell, is not a hero, but in These names, before the label, he is a person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A person who has been tagged with numerous labels after his birth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a person! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man’s eyelids are slightly picking up, his eyes are watching Su Ge at this time, he clap his hands: “Good! Say good! We are What, hey, banker, watchmaker, archbishop or something, these can't change the identity of us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lauri's watch for old age The craftsman didn't have any interest, and even he was too lazy to kill him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is staring at Su Ge at this time, watching Su Ge from the inside out, from top to bottom clean to horror, biting his teeth: "God is not Invincible! Do you really think that you can just let it go in front of our Holy Blood Church!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is very calm, like a learned wise man, answering Said: "I thought that you can live more than I have lived for more than 20 years. I don't think your thinking is still so narrow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I sneered in a cold voice: "My mind is narrow? It's ridiculous, the real narrow person is you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You always have only what you call justice, can't accommodate Anything else. Are you arrogant about ruling the world, ruling all the rules of the whole world, fooling the people, really treating the whole world as your back garden?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Laurie's roar: "Ignorant! You don't know how much we paid for this world!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg’s deep-eyed answer: “I know, even more clearly than you. The bones in the old dreams represent your years of killing.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Old Dream!?" Hearing this time, Laurie's eyes tightened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others are suddenly stunned and unintelligible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your narrow eyes always misjudge our truth and purpose. Now I can tell you that I have no interest in the so-called March goddess dignity. There is no desire for the rule of the world. There is no more feeling for what you call the face, the so-called faith. We are only doing what we think is right, and you have no relationship with you."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Laurie heard this stunned, I didn’t expect Su Ge to say this theory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s face is disgusted and disgusted: “And you are like a child who feels good about himself, self-righteous, inferior and sensitive, strong and arrogant You associate everything with yourself, but the result is full of loopholes, making the world look so broken."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You...what are you talking about? !?" I heard this Laurie's eyes wide open and I felt incredible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was the first time to hear someone commenting on the Church of the Holy Blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge said so straightforwardly: "I don't have any interest in you now, and you'd better not swear by me, so you will be down." I am also annoyed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"........." The old man feels a little breathless after listening to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does this kid compare to the Church of the Holy Blood? Seeing the ugly girl who can't walk the handsome guy? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, this kid is really the most evil cultist, and this dare to say." The old man has already lowered his voice, but it has experienced the vicissitudes of years. The throat has not allowed him to push the sound line down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This voice was heard by several nearby priests, and he glanced at him with some satisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man has a future, and under the sinister sect of this cult, dare to say such a just statement! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the bishops is still considering, do you want to preach the old man’s things and give him a March silver medal? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man felt the enthusiasm of these priests, smiled awkwardly, turned and picked up the fishing rod to continue fishing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If they know the true meaning of the old man's sentence, it is estimated that it will vomit blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "See no! This innocent old man thinks you are the most evil cult!" The bishop yelled at this moment, hoping that this voice could Let the pedestrians in the distance hear it too. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the bishop’s ambiguity and smug look, Kas did not hold back and snorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;! ! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you laughing at?? Traitors!?" The clergyman on the side asked sharply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cass coughed: "Sorry, I want to laugh a little. You continue, you continue!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Laurie did not speak, staring at Su Ge, hoping to see some flaws. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he found helplessly, Shenwei did not have flaws, even if there were, he could not find it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg’s eyes are still deep and his posture is still strong: “I will always look at you and will always judge you.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Judge us? Do you have this qualification?" Laurie sarcastically asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge disapproved, and the tone was all said slowly: "The redemption opportunity is here. If you can’t find it, the disaster of Apocalypse will come, and you will lose some. Hope, forever fall into the abyss of the animal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Laurie said: "Look, you don't have this ability!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug's hands behind him. I ignored the threat of Laurie and turned to look at the broad moat and said, "I naturally don't have this skill. Everything has nothing to do with me. I am now an ordinary person. I am not qualified to judge you. I am only a judge." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because of the mystery, I hope that when we meet next time, you can still be so calm!" Laurie screamed coldly, turned and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge looked at his back and whispered: "If you can meet again next time, you will lose all hope of redemption."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, Under the gaze of the old man, this powerful force left like an anticlimax. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg seems to have happened nothing, re-sit back to the wooden bench next to the old man and watch the fish in the river say: "It seems that there is a fish hook. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey! It’s a silvery white! Hahaha!" The old man gave a hearty laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, a hidden place in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerousus let go of the telescope in his hand and let out a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The side of Adeline followed the drop of the telescope and murmured: "I didn't expect that he even thought of this step."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss touched his chin and murmured: "I have always had a less realistic idea. I was somewhat unpredictable. Now I have about 30% of me." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Adeline hurriedly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss’s face is a bit weird, with uncertainties and temptations in his tone: “The clockman... seems to be my master.”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;! ! ! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing this, Adeline’s eyes were wide and her face was incredible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is this possible!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss scratched his head: "Although this is somewhat disrespectful Yes, but our teachings are like this. Have you discovered that the clock and the Lord have never appeared at the same time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear this, Ed Lin suddenly glimpsed, recalling that from the first time listening to the voice of the gods to the present, the two have never appeared at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the appearance of my master, Su Ge is like a stealth, even if he "retires", the servant should say nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, each time they withdraw from the temple, Su Ge will come out from inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That twice, this is no problem, they thought that in front of the gods, Su Ge had no room for interjection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, every time, this is a bit suspicious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The most important point is that in the identity of the bell, the status is much more distant than the Pope. However, you found that there are not? At that time, His Majesty the Pope was qualified to stand by my body and speak and command normally. But the clockman did not have it at all!" Gerlos made strong evidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adeline was more trembling in her heart and muttered: "It seems...somewhat disrespectful."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss looked at the front: "There is no way to be suspicious. Everything that the clockman has shown at this time is far beyond the boundaries of being human. The most important point of God's grace is labor. I don't know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss looked down at the palm and said: "The reason why people in the world do not receive God's grace is because when people pay back, the gods will almost all refuse. He does not need this knowledge, and will not forgive humans!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adeline trembled in her heart: "What happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The mind and the human mind are very different, we think there is For them, it may be completely different, or the opposite, and the most crucial point in repayment is that there is not only a repayment between the person and the deity. ! Unusual relationship, but also with a unified will "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Adeline not dare to want to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerousus looked at Su Ge sitting there, calmly saying: "Tonight, I will see my lord and ask for this. I believe that my master I won't blame me. But if I can't contact my master, then..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adelin pinches the palm of Gerlos: "Is this really good? What we want is not the truth, but the sanctuary and the faith."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
