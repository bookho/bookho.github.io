			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere is very depressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is Randall not coming?" Su Ge vomited and asked suddenly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hills shook his head: "He entered the bloody holy pool of the family and has not come out for more than a month."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bennis analyzed: "This missionary is estimated to be a master, and the Hunter and the Paladin are estimated to be expert. With our current configuration, it should be able to catch up. "."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How long have they left? What did they leave?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bobby said hard: "About an hour, it is left in a carriage, the speed should be fast." Su Ge finished <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge was immersed in contemplation after listening to it, constantly thinking about countermeasures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey! You seem to be in a deadlock!" came steady with a scornful voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug turned to look at it, just to see Luke’s smile falling from the sky, and with him Roland, whose temperament has completely changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today Luke has completely reintegrated into the city, wearing a smug black suit and a bowler hat, looking at an elegant aristocrat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Su Ge can feel that Roland has completely entered mystery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adeline sees Luke’s eyes full of dignity, whispering to Su Gedao: “Be careful, this guy, at least the mysterious person at the Lord’s level "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge can't manage that much at this time, and immediately goes forward: "If you come, it is estimated that it is not empty-handed!" Luk said with a smile: "Your eyes are really hot. I heard Roland say that you still have a sister, so I have nothing to look at." Oops, it’s the sister of Soge Sotos. It’s really not an ordinary person. Naturally, I have to take care of it.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ada people!?" Su Ge hurried forward and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Ida is deceiving him, Su Ge’s feelings for her have not changed much, because for so long, her care and shelter for her is Really hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luke closed his eyes and felt it, then he was full of surprises: "It’s really a bit interesting, let’s go! If you have a carriage, go quickly, I can catch up with the last good show."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two people divided into two groups, and Bernice, Marx and Bobby temporarily hide to help Bobby stabilize the injury. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge and Adeline followed Luke to the Glorious Church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sitting in the speeding carriage, Adeline watched Luke in a vigilant manner: "You have a faint moldy smell on your body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? It’s not that Gerlos’s old-fashioned, the nose is really sharp,” Luke said casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug 愣: "Do you know the master of Gerlos?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What did I say? It is also the central archbishop of the church. Isn't it an accident to know some old-fashioned hunters?" Luke said casually, telling a huge secret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adeline warned: "You better not to use any brains. Although our Pope is looking weak, you don't know his true Horror."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Pope? You are the Pope!?" Hearing this Luke's eyes wide open, his face was incredible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge faintly asks: "What? Not like?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not like! Luke did not give face very much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Which pope is a small sect in other churches? What sects are you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Suge's mouth twitched slightly, but still very temperamental reply: "The evening bell church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The evening bell church...the evening clock...the night bell..." Luke whispered, slowly fading his face and scorning, and finally completely silenced and stopped talking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge was completely silent at the moment, and some irritated asked: "What happened there? Is there any danger to Ada?"<br <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luke’s pretending to be mysterious: "She is very safe. As for what happens, you can see it for yourself. It’s boring to say it!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After about half an hour, the Suger horse car gradually stopped, and Suger gradually heard a fight and screams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg heard the heart suddenly tightened and hurriedly got out of the car. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the sight of the scene suddenly shocked Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are bloodstains and internal organs everywhere on the road. The entire body of the demon hunter was broken before, and the organs of the body were like disintegrated robots. Everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage stopped quietly on the side of the road, and Ada stood calmly beside the white horse and gently appease. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the road not far away, there is a scene of bloody and cruel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, the female knight named Vegginia had faded most of her heavy armor, wearing only the lightweight armor, and the collarbone and arms were exposed. Come, it looks very tempting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time she stood there, waving her big sword and slamming to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on the ground under her feet, there was a white-haired middle-aged man, a companion missionary to the horsewoman, Father Harold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Father Harold’s legs were completely smashed, his hands were cut off, and he almost became a human stick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Virginia’s eyes widened at this time, her mouth widened, and her face showed a very pleasant, yet distorted smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hahaha! You old bastard! I have been holding you for a long time! I finally found the opportunity!" The cheerful voice came from Vegniya's mouth, and then the big sword in the hand waved again, will be Father Harold. One arm is smashed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French Harold’s face was red at this time, and his forehead was violently screaming: “Are you crazy! This damn guy! What do you want to do! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you do? Do you really think that I don't know how many poor women have you been plagued for so many years?" Vegniya suddenly lowered her voice and bent down. Said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French Harold gnawed his teeth: "Don't forget! You are also a kind of elder of the church. If it weren't for me to find those women, you thought you could be born!" ?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嘎嘣...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the shrill bones is broken, heavy The ridge of the sword completely broke Father Harold's entire arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know! I know! So I used this body that I was cursed by my mother to gradually tear your flock!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vicginia’s spirit seems to be less stable. At this moment, suddenly it is picked up and the sword is lifted again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Front, Father Harold became a human stick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You crazy, I was really blind! But you don't want to be proud, my soul will curse you forever! You can never return to the Glorious Church ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hahahaha! Hahahaha!" Vegginia seems to have heard the world's best laughter, giving a very incomparable laughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who will go back in that kind of ghost place? Go to those dirty pigs as xing slaves? You may not know, my mother gave me when I was born." Under the curse, this body will bear the pain of burning like a fire as long as it touches a man. Do you know how much pain I have suffered in that ghost place? Hey! Now I am out, I am free! I finished my mother. The vow, although the body has been touched by men, my body is still intact!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
