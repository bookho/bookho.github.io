			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the vast old city, thousands of people gathered here, but no one can make any sound at this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horrible pressure from the ancient times, like the sky is falling down on their heads, so that they dare not move, do not dare to offend, not even dare to breathe . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Booming...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is thunder and lightning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calling...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The breath of the earthquake is slowly coming out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On top of the mountain, the Holy Father was slightly covered: "See the Emperor of the Storm."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Holy Father has no psionic breath, but he is very calm and does not seem to be affected by a trace of Longwei. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gwens looked down at the Holy Father, and there was no sadness and no joy in his deep eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are a person who knows the general."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Father is silent and nodded Deeper: "Thank you for your kindness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, Ge Wensi looked up at the three archbishops who were already scared and stupid, The three Holy Grail Dharma bishops, as well as the dark stars and butchers, gradually flashed a faint light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咔嚓! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, the seven dazzling thunder of light descended from the sky, like a heavenly penalty to remove the seven other than the butcher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seven people immediately looked extremely pale, and watched the glare of the thunder came to the front, but did not dare to dodge, dare not defend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A burst of tearing pain passed from the soul to the whole body, they felt their body was torn, the spirit could be evaporated, even breathing difficulties, the whole body lost perception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A second later, the three lord-level archbishops exuded the black smoke of the whole body, unable to kneel on the ground, and could not see it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other four bishops are directly blackened, motionless, and life and death are unknown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your kindness again." The Holy Father raised his hands and looked very serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gwens stood up slowly and raised his hand slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two-meter sword that pierced the summit was suddenly thrown into his hands with a thunder, and Ryan looked down on the ground and said, "What do you want to say?" ??<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lyan shook his head: "There is nothing to say."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gwens Snorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the dark clouds, a ray of light formed by a thunderbolt is like a meteor that breaks through the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The glare of the light completely illuminates the dark sky, and the horrible thunder illuminates the face of everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, when people returned to the light from the thunder, they found a large pit five meters in diameter where Ryan had just stood. At this time, Ryan’s appearance is extremely miserable. The whole body is full of red flames. The whole body is like a broken porcelain, and there is always the danger of collapse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哗啦啦......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of debris from his face, neck, chest The ground fell off and turned into a drop of liquid like a flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lyan was lying on the ground at this moment, unable to move, even the left eye was broken, leaving only the right eye, slightly looking up at the high Vince, all said with difficulty: "Thank you for your kindness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gwens didn't talk, turned his head to look at the clergy at the foot of the mountain, the stars in the eyes Disillusionment is like a black hole that devours everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He rises from the ancient times farther than the gods, and after many years of sleep, he wakes up in this era. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All human morality has no binding force on him, even if the March church does not bind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Father saw a pale face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the clergy are as if they are going to collapse, and they are very clear about what the storm emperor wants to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the ground, the clergy on the ground at this moment felt a terrible horror in looking down on themselves, the pair of eyes like the gods, Looking at my life with icy cold, it seems that I am going to shoot them all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Father had sweat on his forehead at this moment, and at the moment he was ready to speak, Su Ge’s voice sounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a time, the eyes of everyone in the world fell on Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Forget it, they are just a group of deceived poor people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gwens After listening to the cold in the eyes, it gradually dispersed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go!" He waved at Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哗! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black cloak of Su Ge has no wind and dance, with Su Ge and Shirley in his arms leaving the ground and standing on the top of the dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone looked up at the seemingly thin figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brain is blank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rumble...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, with a boom, people found the sky dark again Go on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a gust of wind burst out and raging around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the storm, people barely saw Sug, holding Sherry, look down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark eyes, with an indescribable chic and calm, it seems that everything in the whole event is in his grasp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, countless black clouds melted into the gray body and wrapped the huge body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a deafening thunder and lightning, the horrible presence of the flying sand, the horrible presence left the ground and returned to the sky. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people are shocked from the ruins of the city, the difficult houses climbed out of the collapsed houses, and the heart looked at the sky, only to find that the sun was shining and the sky was blue. ,Cloudless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The turmoil throughout the ancient city ended with this shocking gesture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wall of the ancient city, Andrew with a big sword stood in the dilapidated city wall, the expression is full of excitement and happiness: "haha, this time came out really When I got to a lot of interesting things, I went back and chatted with the family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said, he turned and left the ancient city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well!? What did Sug after he took the abyss skull?" Suddenly, he looked at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know when, all the memories that appeared with the Holy Grail have not disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person with whom he has similar circumstances, and everyone else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Father who is now trying to save people has forgotten how Su Ge summoned the snow and those souls, even their In cognition, the Holy Grail has already been summoned to failure, and their ultimate goal is to kill Shirley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the people stood up hard, they were still in the shock of the emergence of the dragon, and they forgot that they had a memory that suddenly disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man said back to God: "Let's go and see the casualties of the church in March. After all, it is an ally, and you have to help after the work."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequently, all those who did not fall into the fortress began to act. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, there is also the Elf Order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lance and Bells seem to be stupid after being shocked and returning to God. The mouth is always smiling, as if he has encountered the happiest thing in his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four colleges are integrating their own students, and the very safe students have broken their arms and legs because of the storm caused by the dragon. Fourteen students were caught in a coma, and dozens of students had minor injuries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it seems that the loss is serious, but no one student died, this is very crucial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the most important thing is that they see new hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Director! Director! Mr. Sotos!" A male student who had just been dug out of the ruins was dusty and his legs were cut off. Tear the master's arm and say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The director is a bit embarrassed at this point because he just spoke and all the students heard it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Su Ge leaves, he goes to the old principal and invites Su Ge to the college. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asylum is only one aspect, and the other is natural teaching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough and cough, well-repaired, Mr. Sotos will deal with things, rest assured." The director said with a hard scalp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The students nodded with satisfaction and looked at them with two eyes and fainted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the infusion of the three top blood remedies, the three archbishops were finally saved in a violent cough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the three Holy Grail bishops and dark stars are dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three archbishops struggled to sit up, and the darkened skin quickly gained new life, just like a newborn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, all three are in deep silence, bowing their heads and not talking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ryan’s body has recovered almost, and the body stands up and squats and says: “Dawn, your human feelings are paid off.” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Father apologized for his apology: "Sorry, I am sorry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ryan's generous pendulum I waved my hand and sighed with a sigh of emotion: "This does not blame you, the storm emperor is a legend in the ancient times, the legendary legend of the first taming dragon. Don't say you, even me, dreaming Unexpectedly, your legendary bishop can actually summon this character."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are your plans for next?" asked the Holy Father. Ryan looked at the sky and sighed: "Since I saw it, nature can't miss it. It must be a redemption with the storm emperor. He did not deprive me of my knowledge and memory." It is already the greatest gift to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The undead is killed and will not die, but will lose all previous memories and knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is very deadly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you say...He? Is it..." The Holy Father and the three archbishops who had just returned to God were shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ryan said calmly: "The Storm Emperor and his dragon have maintained this appearance for hundreds of thousands of years."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, everyone is in silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Goodbye, my old friend. It is my second greatest fortune to meet you in this era." Ryan said that the pace left lightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for his first great luck, needless to say, naturally, I can meet the storm emperor just now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top of the mountain is once again dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
