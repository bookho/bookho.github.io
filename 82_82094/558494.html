			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! Boom! Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacred, long, and solemn bells reverberate throughout the city, like the music of the gods, and the solemn judgment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the people present, all look silly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is concentrated on the unspeakable majestic figure on the top of the mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four huge wings, the black feathers that are constantly floating, the robes of the cold wind hunting, what is it, they don’t know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they only feel a great existence at that time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can pronounce anyone, he can redeem anyone, he can kill anyone...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;All the members of the Elf Order are kneeling down at this time, continually worshipping the figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes! Not a salute, but a pilgrimage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, to the saints, to pay tribute to the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is that still human?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The director of the school opened his eyes and looked at the back, Full of incomprehensible complex emotions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At that time... Mr. Sotos?" At this time, the students gradually returned to God and asked with a dull expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teachers were also able to return to God at this time, nodded dull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A city is in a deadlock, and everyone is covered by the sacred night clock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are calm, spirited, and devout, as if they are listening to the teachings of the saints. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the priests who are preparing to attack put their weapons in sluggishness, looking silly, like a demon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can we attack such a sacred being!!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what they think at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, it seems like time has solidified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long the time has passed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drink! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know where to come from, a long sword burning with flames was thrown out and shot behind Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sword is very horrible and very fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s almost impossible for Su Ge to dodge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! boom! boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This horrible sword directly pierced the three-level master's night clock and directly penetrated into the body of the death of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My God! How is this possible!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See this sword, everyone All were shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a large number of people appeared on the top of the mountain and looked at least 30 people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a man in the middle who is burning with flames. This is the undead who entered the state of fire, Ryan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哗! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As soon as the sound of broken glass came, the body of death that Su Ge had just appeared was directly destroyed by this sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a burst of blue mist, Su Ge’s pale face was half-squatted on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this scene, everyone reacted abruptly, only to think of it, he is only a person, not a god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What kind of form is that?" All the people are filled with doubts and are more curious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this group of students with a worldview is still incomplete. At this time, the worship of Su Ge has reached an indescribable point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the invisible power, the long sword flew back, like a flying sword, returned to Ryan’s hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This sword, I have endured for countless years." Ryan was full of refreshment at this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first, people with similar forms slaughtered his age. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that he has gone through countless years, he finally has a hint of revenge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cure!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Word of the Holy Words came out, the pale face of the priesthood The people quickly recovered and then stood up in shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you okay?" Sherry looked at Sugg and whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Su Ge is really not good, the form of death consumes all his psionic power, and then he is forced to break by the sword of Ryan, which makes him The spirit has suffered tremendous trauma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are an old man, do you want to be a young man like me?" Su Ge touched the blood of his mouth and asked hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lyan grinned: "Don't get me wrong, this sword is not for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He I really appreciate Su Ge, just a sword, he really can't help it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the three archbishops spread out and surrounded Su Ge on the edge of the cliff. The Holy Word came with the three bishops of the Holy Grail, and said seriously: "Sug, give up her, she is a scourge for this world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, the white bishop suddenly pointed his finger, a dazzling light Flashed past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shirley’s body suddenly sneaked away, barely escaping this, but it was shot through the hood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This light seems to have an indescribable corrosive force, and the hood that is shot through quickly breaks down into countless pieces of light and disappears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Sherry’s beautiful face appeared, the sages opened their eyes: “You really succeeded!”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley sneered, didn't speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge stood up at this moment, holding Shirley behind him, and took a small bottle from his clothes and said, "The Holy Father, there are some things you don't understand." The hope that the world is redeemed is on her body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing!?" The Holy Father looked at Su Ge's movements and immediately asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger has now poured the vial of the potion into his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a burst of dark blood vessels crawled across his neck to his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My God! You are crazy!" I saw this immediately shouting loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nighthawk Church is the birthplace of the Demon Hunter, so she instantly recognizes what this thing is! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this, everyone in the presence of the priest is not good, even can be said to be moving and can not bear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How terrible the potions are, they are very clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the church, they naturally saw a lot of experiments on the use of potions for the death penalty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kind of heartbreaking screams that make them forget in this life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Word is complicated: "Don't you die, don't you want to help us?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Laurie clenched his fist: "Maniac! You are a madman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Su Ge’s eyes tightened, and then the dark erected glimmers The light is like the eyes of a dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ryan was in silence, and he suddenly felt that he had just made a mistake and made a mistake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butcher’s face was gloomy to the extreme, and the sawtooth chopper was directly squeezed into a scrap of iron to express his dissatisfaction and anger at the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Words opened their mouths several times, but could not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The newly weak Su Ge suddenly burst into a horrible momentum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's the inferior shark potion." said a demon hunter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The potion has already worked, it means the venom has gone deep into the bone marrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if it is the inferior potion, it means that this person has been saved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shu’s hoarse voice came: “The Holy Father, you have your persistence, I have my principles. I respect you, but your vision and thinking Limiting you. The real horror of the world, you don't understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, the holy night bell rings again, and the form of death reappears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咔! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger put his cane on the ground, and the left hand Shirley was behind him, slowly raising his right hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, Su Ge found that his body quickly became stiff and unable to move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This stiffness seems like your body and soul have become stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cage that has not been hands-on, shot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few breaths, Su Ge made his body move, and even the psionics became blocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Kill the woman!" The cage said faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Su Ge is like a statue, not moving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the Aurora quickly stepped forward and found Shirley's body and attacked again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, hey! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A strange and heavy bell suddenly remembered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The breath of death erupted, directly dispelling all the knowledge of coagulation, and then a night to protect the Aurora's attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is impossible!" Seeing this scene, the eyes under the iron bucket of the cage are full of incredible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge spit out a sigh of relief: "My heart is not something you can touch."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Just now, the body of the cage did not imprison all his body tissues, even psionic energy, but the heart of Su Ge could not coagulate, because it was not the heart at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night clock of the soul is sent through the heart, instantly breaking all the cages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it okay?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley gave a cry, not much to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the Holy Father took out the holy book and the three archbishops stood up at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three unspeakable terrorist pressures broke out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bound!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, countless darkness suddenly appeared, entangled in Su Ge body of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The master-level shot is extraordinary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Words said: "Forbidden!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, a burst of golden light appeared. Turn into a single cockroach and smash the body of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Staring and suppressing." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A huge eye appeared in the sky, a thick light shining on Su Ge's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a time, Su Ge felt that the whole body could not move, and even the eyes could not move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚咚咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The violent night clock is constantly coming out, but it has no effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lord has absolute repression of the master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three lords shot at the same time, and Su Ge did not have the possibility of escaping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a time, Su Ge was in a desperate situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people in the distance saw this moment holding their breath, clenching their fists, and even tightening their toes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because they are instinctively supporting Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of desperation, let them bring their hearts to the eyes of the blind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With countless gaze, the Holy Word walked up and looked at Su Ge calmly saying, "Sorry, I have my insistence."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, whispered a few whispers, a burst of golden light emerged, turned into a big hand to catch Shirley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snowly, his face was pale and seemed to be very scared of this big hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the crucial moment, Su Ge suddenly said: "The Holy Father, you don't care where the Holy Grail is?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear this, the Holy Father is a glimpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, Su Ge’s black gloves suddenly burst into a horrible light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No! No! This is impossible!" The Holy Father lost his voice at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very cold, sacred bell came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger’s body still can’t move, but the illusory four wings open, because the black gloves can move freely and the right hand palm slowly squeezes, then suddenly burns up The horror of the cold flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am in the name of mad hunting, dominance, etc.!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s heavy voice It sounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, Su Ge’s body of death began to tremble violently, and a burst of light erupted from the glove. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the name of hunter hunting, my people! My Knight! My Guardian! Wandering in the abyss, wandering in the cold winter, dancing in the dark, The servants who have risen in hardship!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Follow my call, obey my will, come to the world!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;唰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless lights bursting out of Su Ge's gloves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happens!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, countless cold winds suddenly appear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This moment is like the whole world has fallen into a cold winter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless blizzards coming out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it’s not just a blizzard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With countless cold winds, countless ice and snow appear, and there are countless violent souls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These souls are incomparably full of unwillingness, anger, frenzy, resentment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, thousands of souls have come to the world with the snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
