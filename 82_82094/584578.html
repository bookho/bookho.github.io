			<div id="content"><br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; In the afternoon, two people lying on the sun deck received an invitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a decent white suit, blue shirt, tall female. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello, Mr. Assassin." Female blonde, the body's bones are large, not beautiful, but full of wild charm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug, lying on the chair, looked up slightly and looked at the tall woman who was about the same height as herself. Politely asked: "What does this lady have? ?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a gentleman, when calling any young lady, it should have been preceded by the word beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the habit of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until a year ago, after Suge called a woman beautiful, that night, the woman died, I heard that I was killed by countless monsters, and died. Very miserable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to eyewitnesses, countless darkness has become a monster, and the situation is extremely strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indirectly caused three witnesses to go crazy and go crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since then, Suge has been very careful when talking to women. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tall women are very imposing, and the voice is somewhat rough and neutral. "I heard that you are a psychiatrist, just as our captain needs a psychiatrist. Help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain?" Su Ge brows a pick. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; tall women slightly bowed and said:. "My name is Mara Markey, vice captain Sa Luni ocean-going cruise" <br /> <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Su Ge’s heart moved, took off his eyes and stood up and smiled and said, “I’m honored to meet you, Marqui’s deputy captain.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Markey smiled and nodded and said: "The captain needs your help. Of course, the help is not unpaid. We will pay you a certain amount of compensation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Su Geton smiled heartily: "Well, let me and my fiancee put on a dress, this is a big offense to see the captain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This made Margin very happy, and said with a bigger smile: "Please, the captain has plenty of time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Sugla is reluctant Sherry returned to the room to change the summer beach clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this also in your expectation?" Xue Lier looked at the calm Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly: "The man was affected by mystery, and my punch left a mysterious trace. A world-class ocean-going tanker does not There may not be any mysterious defense measures. Since someone forced me to take the shot and pushed me out of the crowd, then as he wished, I would have to pick up all the mice along the captain's hand."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley heard this and muttered with black gauze gloves: "You seem to be getting smarter and smarter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Su Ge sighed and pointed to his slightly white eyes and said: "This is a price, my dear Shirley."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp After an hour, re-dressing and replacing the two men in a formal dress led by the captain of Marchi to the top and front of the entire cruise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the best place for the entire cruise ship landscape. The large room walls are made of special glass and have a one-way transparency. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outside can't see the inside, but the inside is open, but has a 360-degree full view. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, on a circle of sofas in the middle of the room, a middle-aged man of about fifty years old sat there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is wearing a black suit, blond hair combing, his face is full of rain and vicissitudes, dark skin, sturdy and strong, sitting there waist Straight, can see the obvious military style. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rough national character has a big eyebrow on the face, and at first glance, it gives a sense of oppression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing him, Su Ge instantly remembered the legendary Admiral Green Grass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two people’s momentum and posture are somewhat similar, but this one is much worse than Green. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain, Mr. Assassin and Ms. Newton have arrived." Marchie came with two people, respectfully said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man recovered from meditation after hearing it, looked up at Su Ge and then smiled and said: "I thought Mr. Assassin should It’s a 40-year-old middle-aged person. I didn’t expect you to be so young.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, the middle-aged man stood up and reached out and smiled heartily: Macock Gellers, the captain of this cruise ship, is very honored to meet you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug holds his rough big hand and says: "Olympic Ding Assin, a psychologist from the Bertrand Empire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Macock then turned to look at the always silent Shelly, marvel Said: "Your fiancee is the most beautiful lady I have ever seen in my life. I swear to the goddess of March."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, snow Lill still didn't talk, standing quietly beside Suge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger said in a hurry: "My fiancée has experienced some shadows in her childhood and is hostile to all strangers. I have been helping her for years. Grooming, finally let her go out normally, but..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speaking of this, Su Ge’s face smiles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Macock didn’t care to take two people and sat down and said, “I understand that the horror and darkness of the human heart have seen me a lot.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your understanding." Su Ge said gratefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three people sat down, and one side of Marchi asked: "Do you want to drink coffee or black tea?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two cups of black tea, a piece of candy." Su Ge said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listening to a slight smile, Marchi turned and prepared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, only three of them were left in the big room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What does the captain need me to help?" Su Ge asked with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Macock indulged and said, "Do you remember the person who attacked you in the morning?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Well, what's wrong?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Macock seriously said: "We just carried out a detailed inspection and inquiry to him, and found that attacking you is not his intention, he is mysterious The impact."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mysterious influence?" Su Ge brows a pick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Macock continued: "I am a soldier, so I don't really like the kind of thing that is turning around. When we check his body, he is Some psionic remnants were found in the ribs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled without speaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Macock seriously said: "Although I know this is so rude and abrupt, I still want to directly determine that you are a mysterious person. Right?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled haha: “I haven’t seen anyone who is so straightforward for a long time.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Su Ge leaned back on the sofa and said, "I like straight people, so I am too lazy to turn around. If you think, I am indeed a mystery." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this, Macock had some surprises, and he did not expect Su Ge to be so generous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The captain called me this time, not just to make sure that I am a mystery?" Su Ge asked directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Macock nodded: "Yes, but before that I want to be sure of your identity, which organization do you belong to?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge smiled and said: "Is this heavy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is very important."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;“Why?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I need to determine if you are my enemy.” When it comes to this, Macock’s body is getting tighter, that’s hearty. The middle-aged man is sharp at this moment, like a cheetah staring at the prey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge Damascus Knife sat there, calmly and confidently asked: "Are you sure you have a chance to kill me here?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Macock seriously said: "I don't want to kill you here, I need a mysterious person who can be trusted to help me."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, how can you get your trust?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Macock seriously said: "Prove your identity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge carefully When Macock was concerned, he suddenly asked: "Can you contact Green now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Hearing this, Macock glimpsed . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge said: "I ask you, can you contact Green Grass?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Macock silenced for a few seconds and nodded and said, "Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge casually said: "Then you can contact the legendary general now. Say hello to his friends in the dream. After that, he will prove my identity like you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear this, Macock squints:" Are you testing me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Whatever you think, the whole thing is actually very simple." Su Ge casually spread his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Marchi walked over the plate and said, "Please use."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Thank you.” Su Ge took the black tea with a smile and took a sip and said, “The taste is perfect.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here Makok meditated, and he whispered a few words at Markie's ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marki was shocked and then turned and left quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Macock looked at the calm Su Ge and asked: "If the proof fails?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Su Ge drank black tea and said, "There is no failure."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking here, the two people are simultaneously silent, and the time is slowly in a dead silence. Over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge and Sherry are very calm, and they talk about the surrounding scenery. It seems to be two tourists who come here for sightseeing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Macock is motionless and calm and deep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Five minutes later, Marchi stepped in and whispered a few words in Makok’s ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, Macock suddenly flashed a burst of shock, then whispered, "Are you sure?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Markin seriously nodded: "OK, the news that the general will personally convey."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Macock turned Looking up to the wall not far away, looking at the distant waves of Su Ge, with a trace of awe in his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then whispered to Marchi: "Disarmed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a command here, and Macock stood up and walked over to Suge and said, "I am sorry, Mr. Assass."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled and asked: "How is the result?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Macock said with a smile: "Everything as you might expect "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; more Scottish smile asked:." so we can not just continue the topic of the "<br /> <br /? >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
