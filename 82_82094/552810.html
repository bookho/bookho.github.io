			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After disposing of the five clergy, Su Ge continued to move toward Sapir. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time Sapir sat back to him, as if it were a hill, seemingly sleeping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the crisp footsteps approaching, Sapir’s large body fluctuated, and the six-meter-high body became ten meters as it stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eight-meter-long robotic arm rested on the ground, and he slowly turned around, his face on the chest muscles, looking at Su Ge with his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When seeing Su Ge’s attire, it seems to completely touch something in his heart, accompanied by a screaming scream, the monster’s muscles squirming It rushed to the side like crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, his huge robotic arm flashed a horrible current, like a lightning monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is in a normal state and continues to release the night clock of the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intensity of this evening clock is much stronger than before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger was not supposed to fight for you, he has more convenient and tricky ways. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night of the soul of the town has a strong calming and meditation effect on the wise creatures, and the strange ability can even change the Luke of the beast. normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of the form of Sapir at this time, Su Ge has confidence, even if he is not allowed to return to normal, he can also restore some of his wisdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result is similar to that expected by Su Ge. After hearing the night of the soul of the town, Sapir’s huge body suddenly stagnated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the violent thunderbolt gradually dissipated. He raised his hands and grabbed his body. It seemed that there was something terrible on his body and he wanted to tear them off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge calmly stood in front of this behemoth, motionless and confident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thick bells continued to spread, and Sapir struggled more and more, even his body was covered with blood by his claws. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day, he did not change back to the human form, the huge body weakly squatting on the ground, and the bloody eyes were struggling to recover some of the mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Kill me...kill me...I don't want to hear his voice again," Sapir said hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Su Ge cloak fluttered, with Su Ge coming to the height of Salmi’s face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened?" Su Ge took off the mask at this time and asked seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sapir looked up at Su Ge and murmured: "Sug, He is calling me, I...I..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, you can see that Sapir's eyes are rationally and strugglingly covered by blood red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The three shameless guys are the invaders! Kill! Kill!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This When Sapir was frantic, it seemed that the effect of the late bell was not working. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the crucial moment, Su Ge suddenly stretched out four black wings, and countless pure deaths appeared on Su Ge’s sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Repose in peace!" Su Ge said, and the sharp sword stabbed in the death of Sapir's forehead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the long sword piercing Sapir's head, his body did not die immediately, but began a fierce struggle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horrible fist instantly came round and hit him at a speed that exceeded Sugue’s reaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, Su Ge has already prepared for the night bell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the shield was broken, Sog’s body flew more than ten meters away and was parked in midair with the help of a cloak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge spit out a sigh of relief, but he was not injured except for the punch of the punch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distant Sapir sent a scream of screams, the sword was still on his forehead, and a lot of dark, dead breath had penetrated into it, even Turned his face into black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge has thought of his strange form, and pure physical death is likely to be ineffective. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in order to be on the safe side, he still used enough breath of death to give his spirit the erosion of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Booming...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to be a beast that is about to die, a huge body running wildly , chaos, howl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the body gradually becomes weak as he moves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two minutes later, a plop, the huge body fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horrible body quickly shrinks and eventually returns to normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long sword stabbed on his forehead, and although his eyes were wide and his eyes were inconspicuous, his eyes were full of joy and joy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that in the moment of dying, I am happy and comforted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge silently came over and pulled out the sword, and Sapir’s wide eyes gradually shed two tears, his mouth slightly tilted up to reveal a peaceful smile. The eyes slowly closed, leaving a look of serenity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His soul is impossible to be redeemed, but his will has been freed from the whispers of the ancient god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge's face is a bit complicated, and he doesn't feel good about Sapir. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This guy is proud, arrogant, self-contained and uninhibited, and seems to be aiming at himself all the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now that he is dead, Su Ge is not happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not yourself who really kills Sapir, but the ancient evil spirits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the teachings of the Church of the Night, the enemy of mankind is not his own compatriots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body lays down the body of Sapir, and Su Ge leaves silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not a loser. He has struggled and resisted. Even after becoming a monster, he also showed his human dignity and covered the coalition. Retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a deal here, and Sug quickly walked towards Randall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, it is very difficult for two people to rely on each other for fighting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one of these five people will be a spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the physical strength is terrible, even with the butcher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And their combat skills and swordsmanship are truly masters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time the sword is as accurate as a scalpel, it is as fast and deadly as a sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their movements are flowing, without any extra movements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether it is attacking, retreating, running, turning around is the precision and the ease, without wasting any physical strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrew is an veteran and the overall level of action is similar to these five. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Randall’s movements are like a big stupid bear compared to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s okay, with Randall’s unstoppable meat shield, Andrew’s attack at this time is a lot more aggressive than ever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rushed Su Ge first released a night of the soul of the town to determine the situation, and then found that the five people did not have any fluctuations, and did not receive any influence . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only one kind of person can be affected by the night clock of the town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is: not a person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this, Su Ge directly sent out a series of sound waves to scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five people felt that the offensive was suddenly a meal, and then the sword retreated to defend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Andrew and Randall seized the opportunity at this moment, and the two men stepped forward at the same time. Randall’s big hand waved and a ghost suddenly appeared on the ground. The wolf bite a man's thigh, and then Andrew's sword slashed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sword goes down and cuts the person directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the person who was cut off did not have any blood flowing out of his body, but the body directly turned into a ray of light and disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this?!" Andrew was shocked to see this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge walked over and said: "These people are not real people, but phantoms summoned from the sunken city of Aya by some means." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When looking at the remaining four people, Su Ge continued: "If under normal circumstances, only the summoning array continues, these five people will never die." It’s not damn. But unfortunately, their connection with Byron City has been cut off by the eyes of Venus, so it only takes one kill.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp When I heard this, Andrew looked at it: "I said how they look so old, it is not undead. It was the ancient phantom that was summoned."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Knowing their nature, plus the arrival of Su Ge, the situation of three dozen four has more advantages than before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four people are very powerful, but after all, there is no spell, all attacks need to be cut out with a knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And their attacks have almost no room for resilience in the face of Randall’s system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three people worked together and it took less than ten minutes to settle the remaining four. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the last person becoming a sly light disappeared, everyone turned their eyes to the distant passage that continued down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The passage is very large, full of more than ten meters high and twenty meters wide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The edge of the wall is broken very smooth, there are also the table and hooks with the torches on it, and the passages are often used. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The atmosphere of the abyss is getting heavier and heavier, and the skull is below the passage." Andrew said that he had set aside the big sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug grabbed him and released the aftermath of the night clock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because there is a lot of water in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a small blisters, but a surface that is almost 30 meters wide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The water inside is relatively turbid, but it doesn't feel deep, because there are a lot of raised ground in the middle, it looks like it is a piece of rain. The square is average. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night bell was released, and Suge snorted and lifted his foot and stepped on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗡嗡嗡...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sudden burst of violent vibration passed through the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fluctuations of a circle appear on the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the entire surface of the water actually surged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咕噜噜噜...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a burst of bubbles, a large number of insects on the water from the surface Floating down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These worms are similar to scorpions, but they are smaller, with two scorpion stalks and a tail with a poisonous needle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
