			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smiles of the two people flashed past, and when Su Ge saw the expression of Mr. Pigu’s face, he showed a smile and looked at him. Nodded slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pigu saw the hard-nosed nodding after the expression, then pulled the female partner and turned and ran. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley said with satisfaction: "I finally recognized my identity, this bed bug."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The next time is relatively calm, Su Ge with Shirley continues his corrupt life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third night on board. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug is sitting in the living room of the room, with a incense burner on the table in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The incense burner is not large, only the size of the fist, the whole body is quaint silver gray, the style and size are very similar to the incense burner in the hands of Bernice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This incense burner is a ritual instrument that he designed through the combination of the gods and the present. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has designed a total of four instruments according to his own theocracy,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mist prayer incense burner corresponds to fog Master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The death field bell corresponds to the death dominator. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dreamland pendant corresponds to the dream ruler. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The avatar statue corresponds to the god of hoarfrost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four utensils are all in line with the rules of the world, allowing believers to communicate effectively with themselves within the rules. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The design of the artifact was created by Pope Vanas through the best craftsmen of Guinness, by the demon master mil, the master witch voice, master of alchemy The church dungeon fugitive, the master alchemist Nishizawa, supervised and built. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the four artifacts have the ability to communicate with the gods, the material requirements are very demanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guinness’s treasury materials were not enough, and even the extensive connections between Adeline and Randall were used. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first batch of each of them is made up of ten, giving priority to the church's backbone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of this artifact is terrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole process of building down, counting materials, adding them together, the average cost of an artifact is 1000 nk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forty is 40,000 francs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the concept, this 40,000 gram is equivalent to the gross domestic product of a small country like Guinness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Everything can be a baby!" Su Ge touched the incense burner and looked pity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although he lost a certain concept of money, he is very clear that the financial situation of a small country like Guinness cannot support the operation of the entire late church. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So from a year and a half ago, even with Guinness’s support, he still spared no effort to let Adeline and Bernice open up new wealth in the capital. road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Hills and Vigania also continually rushed back and forth in the night and the storm plateau to carry out the secret operation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Randall and Jenny are also working in the darkness of the Lion Empire, continuing their connections and wealth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The core people of the Church of the Night Clock, the nobles and elites of Guinness, are also in the operating companies of their respective roles, attracting investment and making rapid development. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley is more sensitive to money than Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sat beside her and looked at the delicate incense burner: "It’s a waste of it to spend so much money."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, she said ironically: "And with such expensive things, the goal is actually more convenient to beg to yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Speaking of her interest, she rolled up a book and put it as a microphone in front of Su Ge: "I would like to ask Mr. Sotos, what do you want to say now?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looked at the smile, like a charming fox-like Shirley, holding a fragrant stove and said with a serious look: "I feel good, please rest assured the people."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cut, boring." Sherry said, lying comfortably on the soft carpet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug now has no time to lie down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The incense burner is placed, and Su Ge takes out a dark purple, like a candy piece, from the red wooden box on the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This thing is called a soul scent, produced from a special kind of tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tree is called a ghoul tree, unable to grow in normal soil, only in the body of the creature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are very aggressive and deceptive, they secrete tree oil during the growth process, and form this special after a long time of condensation. Fragrant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This incense has a strong affinity for the soul and mystery. After proper blending, it can play the role of exorcism and soothe the nerves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If not, excessive intake of people will produce severe mental debilitation and long-term hallucinations, which are dangerous and high-level mystery material. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the market that Su Ge understands, each piece of spirit is 10 grams, worth about 50 ng. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger has about twenty or so hands, not buying it, but stealing the tombs some time ago... When investigating, killing a group of positive encounters The tomb thief, when he touched the body, searched it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the soul, Su Ge took out some other mysterious materials from the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Including gold leaf grass, sandalwood spice, solid tiger whale oil and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These materials ensure that there is enough fog without damage and that there is a strong mysterious resonance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These materials were placed in the incense burner, and Su Ge waved, the cold cold flame entered silently, and began to slowly burn the mixed materials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few bursts of cold fog emanated along the hollowed-out lid on the incense burner, gradually filling the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley smelled the smell of smoke, and his face flashed a bit of comfort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This smoke has no harm to the mystery, and even has many benefits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect is just like some psychotropic drugs, which makes people feel very comfortable, but not illusory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a large amount of smoke due to the possession of gold nucleus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire room was in a misty fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s hands clasped together, the psionics gradually emerged, and then on the ground, a three-ring array that looked very complicated was lit up, and the array still The cold flame draws, with the highest level of mysterious resonance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the circle of the third ring, the body of the frozen octopus was placed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When everything is ready, Su Ge whispers: "The fog embraces the darkness, the fog gives birth to the light. The fog is between black and white, connecting everything, tolerating everything, great The misty master, listen to the call of the believer, with the shadowless and unknown fog of the valley abyss, your servant will offer you a sacrifice!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With The humming continued, and the fog in the entire room began to roll rapidly, like boiling water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few seconds, the fog seems to form a monster with only countless eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This invisible monster gradually transforms into a big hand, first grabbing the octopus in the middle of the altar, and then like the whales swallowing all the fog Inhalation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the disappearance of the fog, there is the dead body of the octopus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge spit out and stretched out some stiff body and said, "Okay, now you can watch the show."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is still some time before watching the movie..." Shelly was lying on the floor, her palms supporting her cheeks, her dark hair scattered all over the floor, and her eyes were filled with water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugarton’s heart suddenly jumped, although I have seen it many times, but every time Shelly puts a seductive posture, he can’t control it. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not available today, I said it before, two days." Su Ge hurriedly turned his head and refused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not the kind of powerful fighter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, if he hadn’t been exercising and nourishing his body, he had already been drained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cut, waste." Shelley was very upset, turning her head to bed and not talking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge spit out a breath, calmed down the spirit of the night through the soul of the town, turned and lay in bed to enter the dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the octopus was successfully sent to the dream country, it still requires a process to turn this little thing into what he needs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open your eyes, Su Ge sits on the throne of the Kingdom of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shuer." The sound of the high voice sounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A black fog flashed over, and the armored Shure was on the main hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master." Shure said, raising his hands and contributing the octopus in his hand and the energy he just got. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge waved with a twist of dreams on the body of the octopus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, the octopus's body produced a violent squirm, and then suddenly turned into a black mist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that this fog seems to have a special structure, like a horrible beast without a form. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don’t kill him." Su Ge said calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shuer respectfully nodded: "Your will will be implemented."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The form disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Su Ge is facing the gate: "Come in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is silently open, tile Nas walked in the dark high heels, respectful salute: "See my Lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If anything, Vanas will wait outside the main hall, waiting for the Lord to wake up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas voice said devoutly: "According to the intelligence of Hills, there are some changes in the Twin Alliance of the Storm Plateau, which seems to have been affected and affected. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Story Plateau? Because of the King of the Yellow Brothers Brotherhood." Su Ge said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Storm Plateau was originally the third dynasty of the sands, the territory of the Calding Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas nodded and said, "My wise is true. According to the intelligence, the revival of the Brotherhood of the King of the Yellow Emperor is very strong, according to Jenny. News, there are a large number of undead warriors and hundreds of giant demon spirits near the Lions Empire Ocean City, which have caused huge casualties. From all traces, there are still traces of the Brotherhood of the King of Yellow." < br /> /> 〖 〖 〖 〖 〖 The Brothers of the King of Clothes and the Cthulhu Order played against each other. Here, the sound waves, Alger, and Cara led some people into the storm plateau and the Vegnias there, and the sound of the night bell could continue to expand." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Follow!" Vanas said seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
