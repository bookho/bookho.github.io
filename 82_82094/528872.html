			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is standing in a strange city, I don’t know why, at this time his heart is constantly moving, he has a feeling of faintness, here, he Have been here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood in a somewhat narrow square surrounded by three roads leading to other directions in the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a dry fountain statue in the middle of the square. The surface of the white rock is cracked everywhere, and the weeds in it are full of desolateness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of the bricks on the ground have been broken, the gaps are open, and the pits are squatting, as if the ground had been stretched and was overwhelmed by any huge hard material. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The buildings in the city are old-fashioned Gothic style, the houses are crowded and the top is full of tall spires. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wall has been covered by coal and turned black, the wall is very worn, the windows are full of stains, some of the doors are ruined, the oil lamps hanging in front of the door The fire is about to go out, and it will be bright and dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s eyes swept around and found that it seemed to be at the bottom of a city. The streets are narrow and winding, and the crowded houses on both sides are twisted and twisted, comparable to the Leaning Tower of Pisa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the top of these houses, you can see the upward mountain road, and the higher level building on the outside is built in the mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The line of sight continues to look far, is a tall and majestic church, towering towers, bell tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, the city seems to be built in a huge valley, at this moment, Su Ge is at the bottom of the valley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slightly raised his head, Su Ge’s eyes saw the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What makes him feel surprised is that he can see a complete starry sky here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many stars in the sky, but there is no moon. There is no dark cloud, but it gives people a feeling of turbidity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know if it is Su Ge's illusion. He faintly feels that the starry sky is slowly creeping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, Su Ge thought of something, so Ling Shi rose a little again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't tell me that this starry sky is the huge body of the repairs, and these stars are its eyes!" Su Ge said ugly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hurriedly bowed his head and converge, the night of the soul of the soul slowly echoed in his mind, and the feeling of palpitations gradually subsided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stable the mind, Su Ge released the night after the night wave detection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, the aftermath of the late bell can finally stretch normally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug first discovered that the city had a well-developed underground pipeline system beneath the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his investigation, he now has a three-meter-wide, four-meter-high sewer at his feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still a lot of sewage flowing inside. In this sewage, Su Ge found some huge mice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These mice are generally more than one meter tall and can stand up to two meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge mouse is following the sewage and does not know where to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Slowly walking in the square, Suge is full of caution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While sweeping around the eyes, they are also paying attention to the situation at their feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The neat floor tiles are stretched along with the ground, with many gaps in the middle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mud and sand can be seen in the gap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there is no danger of stepping on one foot, but if you run quickly, or carry out a small range of movement. If you drop your foot and accidentally step on the air, you will not only get to the ankle, but the whole person will lose control and fall to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These gaps are comparable to those very vicious traps." Su Ge slowly progressed, and his heart was secret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bell is still continually being distributed. Su Ge found that there are many dim lights in the rooms around, but there is no one, even any creature, the whole city. There was no sound at this time, and he could not even hear the voices of the clergy and mysterious people who fell together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge looked up and looked straight ahead, in front of a chapel filled with run-down and dust, and the piece was filled with tombstones on the side of the church. The small cemetery, full of wild grass, is ruined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a bell tower on the side of the church. The bell tower has a roof that is connected to a higher staircase by a flying raft. It seems to be able to go directly to a higher place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The left side is a step leading to a higher place, the steps go up a high platform, there are two left and right intersections. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another path behind it, twists and turns, leading to the middle of dense buildings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These three roads are all connected to dense towns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a downward staircase on the right side of Su Ge. This is not a crowded house, but a misty place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The downward stairs are connected to an aisle that looks like a promenade. The aisle leads to both sides and does not know where to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outside of the tall fence is a sea of ​​fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray one can't see anything, just like in the clouds, like in the sky, looking at no sense of security. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Suge looked around, he did not rush into the narrow path of the town, but first came to the edge of the cloud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the steps, Su Ge squeezed his cane carefully and looked at both sides, like a thief who had just stolen something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gallery extends to the sides for about two hundred meters and then collects it, which seems to lead to where. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the side of the promenade, most of them are three-storey houses with relatively elegant and beautiful shapes, and many quaint stone carvings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge carefully stood on the edge, releasing the waves of the night bell like the fog in the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, Su Ge suddenly pale, and repeatedly stepped back two steps, almost sitting on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What the hell is that?" Su Ge couldn't help but tremble, as if he had encountered something terrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪嗒! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spirit this time, it went up 7 points and came to 53 points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg didn’t have any stops, turned and fled and walked back to the place where he had just stood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he still feels that the distorted body is pressing on his body, as if he would crush him at any time and swallow it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug can't describe what the huge swelling that I just saw is what it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge body covers the entire sea of ​​fog, the pale, swollen skin is full of hairy tentacles, and the swelled subcutaneous can clearly see the distorted purple black Blood vessels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some parts are even full of festering water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monster that is like a myriad of swollen bodies is a myriad of dead and festering polymers...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Suge feels completely overwhelmed by the horrible thing, can not see the other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Psychic disorder, he can't even use the spirit of the night of the town to stabilize the spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is in a chaos and chaos, watching his spirit gradually get out of control and fall into madness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At a critical moment, he sends a message with his own instinct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, he felt that a crazy idea and frantic thoughts gradually occupied his brain, pulling his will from the body quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And below, there are countless cockroaches eating monsters waiting for themselves, he knows clearly, as long as he goes on, he will never come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, at this time he has no way, he can’t control his body, he can’t control his will, he can only gradually encroach on him by these crazy things. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hehehe...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few seconds later, Su Ge’s look was a bit mad, and his mouth slowly Opened, bursting into a low smirk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The saliva flowed down the corners of the mouth, and the sharp, deep black eyes gradually became chaotic and frantic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large amount of red long hair grows rapidly from Su Ge's pores. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hahahaha! Ah, ah! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spirit of Su Ge gradually lost control, and sometimes yelled in his mouth, sometimes screaming with horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cane is still on the side, his hands clasping his head, his body trembles violently... or convulsions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Su Ge was about to get out of control, the space behind him suddenly appeared like a ripple of water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afterwards, a pair of blue-lit eyes appeared out of thin air in this space, as if it were an illusion that was reflected across the transparent glass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this is obviously not an illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because this blue eye gradually emerged from the hustle and bustle of this space, a scary head came out of the space and appeared behind Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This head is very embarrassing and horrible, like numerous white bones that are glued through a special omentum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its body has no fixed form, such as the same gust of wind, as well as the same fog. unpredictable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bones that are gathered together are constantly gathering and squirming, and the gray omentum seems to be a slow skin agitation, exudes weird and indescribable The strange smell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It only found a head at this time, and then behind the head is a very slender body that still forms a bone and an omentum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gradually, its thin, slender body appears directly in the space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless horns formed by bones on the head, which are covered with spurs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has an indescribable tail, and the skinny but powerful limbs are inserted on the ground like four large bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to be a dead bone dog, and it seems to be a collection of rules, it has a form, but no form. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its body is constantly changing like the wind, in the silver-gray light, the body is looming and unpredictable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People see different shapes from different angles, and some angles seem to be a huge bone dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are angles that look like a big python, some angles look like a sly monster, and some angles look like a human being Harmless pet dog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other angles and perspectives, its form, its everything can not be remembered. Only that pair of ice blues is like the blue of time and space, so that all those who have seen will never forget. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was once known as Kiruyishra, also known as the monster waiting behind the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over time, it is also known as the key to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is everywhere, leaving its own legends and fears in different eras and at different times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also known as the Hound of Time and Space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People have a few records about it, only know that it exists in the ninth sequence of the vision system, rumors need 95 points to see the legend Level Dai: Tinda Rose Hound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tingdaros, in the ancient gods, means boundless, unbounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After it came out, it shook off the thin body that looked like it would fall apart at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A blue bubble filled with a glowing bubble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bubble is full of horror blizzards, so it drills in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless snows, countless hoarfrost, and countless dead souls attached to its thin body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With hoarfrost as the body, with the snow as the hair, with the spirit of the ghost, it becomes a pet dog with a face and a demon expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It opened its mouth and quickly spit out a quirky book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wang! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It screamed and slammed the book to the black cloak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black cloak has long been inductive, soaring and opening the book instantly, it is attached to Su Ge’s eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of this book, that kind of frenzy, that kind of chaos is like seeing a natural enemy, seeing the owner is full of fear and fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red hair quickly receded, shedding, and the chaotic and turbid eyes gradually recovered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a world of chaos and frenzy, Su Ge reveals a calm smile, his thoughts quickly detach from this primitive world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, he took back his will and took his body back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw the world again and felt the reality of the body again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lower his head, he did not feel the slightest surprise for the arrival of Erha, because it came, is his guide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;蹲Touched and touched the second ha, Su Ge’s face of love: “Two goods.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; After Gwens proposed the name Kiruyishra, Su Ge has been paying close attention to the situation of Erha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speciality of Erha is very clear. When he first crossed, his ice heart was bare outside, very conspicuous. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the second Harb came over, he added a few times and actually hidden the heart of the ice from the skin without any abnormality. At that time, Su Ge knew that the core of Erha’s contact with him was the heart of the ice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the days that followed, he often had nothing to do with the gods to think about the relationship between the two, but due to the lack of necessary conditions, the progress is not obvious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until he got the meaning of the name Kiruyishra in Father Water, there was a lot of things that Sugg had figured out in a flash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At that time, he had already guessed the identity of Erha, but there are some details about the things that are not certain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until this time, she met Shirley, and after he confirmed the identity of the gods and the relationship of Yugo Sotos, he really confirmed this. The true identity of the dog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mad hunter and Yugo Sotos had some intersections, and he was dissatisfied with the fact that he was summoned here, so Yugo Sotos gave Part of his own strength, he also gave his servant or the enchanted, Tyndallus hound to the hunter as his mount. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, the spirit of the Tindaros hound and the squirrel’s body in the body of the squid, Yugo Sotos, combined with each other, a stronger relationship between the two . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a simple mount to a partner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the death of the hunter, He gave everything he had to his own partner. This Tindaros hound used his own abilities and Yugo Sotos to give him the relevant privileges, pulling the last battleship from reality to the seams of dreams, and opened up that space for Protect the body of your former master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even the Great God Declaration that traversed the world, it is possible that it was shot and brought to the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the removal of Yugo Sotos, only it has the ability to travel through time and space and enter different worlds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge touched the soft hair of his body, and many doubts in his mind were also untied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When first summoned by Hills and Bernice, Su Ge felt faintly wrong because it was summoned by Yog Sotos The spell shouldn't have such a huge summoning power for himself. After all, he just got the gods and didn't know anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, think about it, Su Ge understands that the main effect of the spell is not on himself, but on the dog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tindaros hound that can travel freely in time and space is the enchantment of the former Yugo Sotos, or a pet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time the spell was summoning the dog, and the reason why Sug took it was because the Soviet Union and the gods were too weak. For some reason, the gods have the same roots as the dog. It can even be said that the gods are not the roots of the sacred god's right, and they are very willing to be associated with this dog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Broken time and space is your ability, so Hills and Bernice can not prepare any ritual materials, and the squad and runes will summon them. Strictly speaking, they don’t call us, but you hear the voice, want to go, right?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two ha at this moment Hey Su Ge, open his mouth and seem to be laughing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are homologous to the same body, and my soul is pierced by the Great God Declaration and reaches the world. The knowledge and laws that have emerged from the Great God's Declaration have formed. This heart of frost can make my soul link and resonate with the body and the body, and you can also use this connection to shape yourself into this look in the ice and snow according to my memory." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, after Su Ge figured out the whole thing, many of the previous doubts and the flash of missed feelings were all found back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sense of violation before the advent, the weird connection between one person and one dog, the second can penetrate the spiritual barrier, the space, the special bark of the will, Everything else can be explained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;搓 搓 搓 哈 的 狗 , , , , , , 苏 苏 苏 苏 苏 苏 苏 苏 苏 苏 苏 苏 苏 苏 苏 苏 苏 苏 苏 苏 苏 苏 苏 苏 苏 苏 苏 苏 苏 苏 苏 苏 苏 苏 苏 苏 苏Now, the swollen woman has also appeared."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it was not seen at first glance, Su Ge still judged at that moment with relevant knowledge and characteristics. Come out, the disgusting thing is the swollen woman, one of the incarnations of Nayaratotip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is an incarnation, it is, after all, one of the legendary three-column gods, Nayaratotip, whose form has gone far beyond human imagination and entered The level of keeping pace with the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Su Ge knew through the night clock, he knew that the big event was not good. He knew that this time he could not bear the horror of looking directly at the gods, so He issued an order when his own rationality had not been swallowed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This order was sent out through the connection between the heart and the two ha, and the content is only one sentence: immediately come to me with the book of Frenzy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is very aware of the causal cycle between them, his will is swallowed up by the swollen woman, wanting to stop this swallow, or flip it, The most powerful deterrent must be used to show your identity and status. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thoughts that have been synchronized with the gods all the time have come to mind a lot of key things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The swollen woman is the incarnation of Nayalatotip, and Nayaratotip is the messenger and son of Assos, known as the peristalsis Chaos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the only thing that can save one's will is the majesty of Assos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Book of Frenzy, one of the five external scripts of The Book of Assos, with the absurd knowledge of Assos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bringing this book over, Suge believes that it can resist the invasion of fear and chaos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result is not bad with what he expected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second emergency that received the urgent task of Su Ge locked the position of Su Ge, picked up the book of frenzy, and rushed out in the big camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then immediately faded his skin and camouflage, turned into the original Tindaros hound form, and entered the space and came to the side of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saved the edge of Su Ge’s madness at the last critical moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge looked down at the frantic book in his hand and sighed: "The last time I almost made you crazy, I never dreamed that one day you saved me. Life is really impermanent!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time I saw the book of Frenzy, Su Ge was almost crazy, if not the voice of Erha, he was already crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, thanks to the special knowledge and pressure on the book of Frenzy, all the chaos and madness are oppressed, giving his consciousness Pulled back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This tells us that even if it's dangerous, don't throw it, maybe you can save your life someday." Sug chanted this Put the book in his arms and bend over to pick up his cane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t want to look at it at the bottom of the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not easy to come back from that state, he doesn’t want to go there again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three roads in front of him, left, right, or running down the chapel to the roof. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The terrain here is too narrow, and the roads are intricate and easy to be encircled and ambushed. If it is normal, it is definitely the most from the roof. Safe. But..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s gaze fell on the dark head: “Now the position and intention of the repairs is unknown, plus the entire city. Unknown, the fog still lies in the swollen woman who seems to fall asleep. Although I can see more when I walk higher, it is easy to become a target of many monster attacks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
