			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ida stood in the run-down hall with bare feet, looking straight ahead, and saw the old king on the top with a special perspective. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knights around are still motionless, but they can clearly feel the horrible atmosphere brewing under the dust, and its powerful strength makes people feel chilly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People can’t judge how strong they are because the current power system doesn’t apply to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But everyone knows that if they really talk about killing knowledge and technology, they will far exceed the mysterious majority of this era. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old king’s eyes are clearly obscured by the mask, but she still presents a condescending look down to Ada, the light purple lips creeping, arrogant The indifferent voice came along: "The time you can stand in front of me is faster than I expected."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ada looks at her Asked: "How long have you been waiting for me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Twenty years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "How long is the "some" you said?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thirty years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Ada smiled: "Your concept of time has opened my eyes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old king is still coldly replied: "The whole world Only time has no meaning for me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is not completely meaningless. After such a long time, I came to you. Ada corrected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old king still leans on the throne, and there seems to be nothing in the world that will allow her to move a bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is silent, she said: "I heard the bell."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Did you think of some bad things?" Ada has a special emotion in his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old king shook his head: "No, it just feels a little missed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, she was pinched by the hand wrapped in black armor: "It seems because Some reasons resonate with the bell."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ida is not going to stand there all the time, she is taking a step to the next step:" The world is undergoing tremendous changes now, and you shouldn't be sitting here all the time. You will miss a lot of key messages."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For example?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For example, not long ago, the storm emperor rode his dragon in this world." Ada walked about a fifth of the height and stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing the old king to silence again, a few seconds later she asked: "After?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Aida then detailed the events of the ancient city at the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He...has the cause and effect with the bell?" The old king’s voice seemed to be asking, and he seemed to be muttering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ada is now taking a step forward again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ang! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a dragon filled with a mighty sorghum sent out from the throne, seemingly threatening the unreasonable man close to the throne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of terror makes Ada's footsteps no longer possible, and can only stand in place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't get in, the little guy." The old Wang's cold voice came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ada smiled and didn't care, turned and walked down the steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Speak your purpose." The old king has an unquestionable command. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ada’s truthful answer: “I’m just curious about your status, come and see. I also hope to confirm my own guess from you.” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old king raised his hand and held his chin, leaning on the big chair, waiting for Ada to continue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ada does not have as much fun taste as Shirley, saying directly: "The whole world has fallen into filth, and pure humans have been few Less. The third night is coming, I am eager to gather enough pure humans to use them as seeds for the next era."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing the night The old king raised his head slightly: "Why come here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The people here are very pure, I hope you and I can join hands." Ada is the color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old king denied: "You, no qualification."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ada seems to have long thought The old king’s answer continued, “Let’s let us do the second thing. I want to confirm my guess by you.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The exchange needs a price." The old king naturally knows what Ada means in this case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Without preparation, I naturally will not step into this land."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ada said two words to the old king: "Ayr."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;! ! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard these two words, the old king’s body suddenly shocked, and the body leaning on the throne gradually sat up: “Where do you know?” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ada replied: "The exchange of intelligence requires a price."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Speak your Guess."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ada looks calm and has prepared for a long time: "You are six ancient kings, whether it was killed by the Death of the Valley."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." The old king responded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because of the location." The old king succinctly answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This answer is ambiguous, but Ada understands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How many of the six kings are alive?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only alone." There is a trace of pride in the tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ada has some accidents: "The Sun King, Sky King, Earth King, Moon Shadow King, Thunder King are all dead, why do you survive as a Star King? "?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question is very rude. If it is not Ada’s special, the old king has already ruined this rude person hundreds of times. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old king leaned freely on the throne, indifferently replied: "The sun will be shot down, the sky will be torn, the earth will be trampled, the moon will be covered, The thunder will eventually dissipate. But the ancient stars never disappear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no star in the sky now."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's not that there is no star in the sky, but all stars are blocked by %#%#¥#¥%."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that The name is not at all human formable to listen to and know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old king knows, but she can't say it, Ada can't hear it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ada’s rare contemplation, for a long time she raised her last question: “What happened to people in the second night?”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old king answered four words with a succinct simplicity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A nightmare."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this regard, Ada’s questioning opportunity has been exhausted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old king looked at her and did not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ada is naturally not a person who does not believe in words, and takes out a page from his arms: "It is a record of the travels of the stars."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old king raised his hand, and the invisible force instantly sucked the book page into her hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
