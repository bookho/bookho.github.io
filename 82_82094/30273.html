			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the heart of the decision, Su Ge turned to think about how to kill this guy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a big waist, I am thin. He has a gun, I don't. He has mysterious power, I don't have it now. I can't respond positively." Su Ge thinks quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, today is the peak of work, there are many people on the street, he scruples his police status, and does not rush to start." Su Ge thought his eyes swiftly Move, find a solution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the road, Su Ge quickly passed through the crowded street and came to a business district that was slightly closer to the city center. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shops here are still not open, and the people on the streets are very quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge turned his head and found that Jess behind him was still following himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What to do! What to do!" Su Ge is more and more anxious, so he will only be forced to go his own way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whistling...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cold wind blew in the face, completely unknown in Suge When I was taking measures, I suddenly heard a fuzzy voice in my ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Twenty meters... turn left, thirty meters, turn right."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Who!?" Su Ge was in a tight heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice did not answer, it seems to have disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugton was caught in a tangled, he could not tell whether the voice was good or bad, maybe it was the trap that Jess set for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eye is looking backwards again, and Serge’s eye is about 20 meters away from his own, and Jess has slowly pulled out his pistol at his waist. "The police revolver has an effective range of 60 meters. I am so dead!" The next second he did not hesitate to suddenly accelerate, crazy forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has no retreat now, and he will not die if he does not listen to this voice. Hearing this voice may still have some way to live. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a gloomy glow in the back of Jess’s eyes as he saw the Sugg rushing, and his body suddenly rushed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I see where you can go!" Jess is confident in his physical fitness. This distance can only be chased in a dozen seconds. Go to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Turning? It’s really a panic, here is a dead end to store garbage, not even a door.” Jess, who has been here for more than a decade, The streets of the city are very well understood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This time I will let you completely die and become a slave to my body." Jess flashed a strange green in his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Sug turned to the wall and ran wildly, running and looking behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just turned around and just saw a gloomy Jess, the distance between the two people was less than fifteen meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hurry!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hurried Su Ge quickly took off his coat and slammed After throwing it, it interfered with his shooting line of sight, and the body slammed all the power into the second corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment of turning, Sug saw not a safe road and place, but a dead end where garbage was stored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, in the face of this situation, Su Ge’s eyes burst into a burst of excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The voice didn't lie to me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a dead end here, but in this dead end There is a broken body that seems to have been eaten by a bad dog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body is not special, so that Su Ge has hopes to be two people standing next to the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two men wore a black coat with a golden goblet coat of blood on their chests, a leather-trimmed hat with a leather top and a shoulder Animal skin shawl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were carrying two swords behind them, one long and one short, with handcuffs and revolver guns around their waists, and darts and ammunition bags tied to the outside of the thighs. They looked like two heavily armed special forces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two people heard the sound slowly turning their heads, and the golden erects like cat eyes appeared in the yellow line of sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not two ordinary people, but two hunters of the Holy Blood Church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demon hunter belongs to one of the church's institutions dealing with mysterious time. These people lost all human feelings after becoming a demon hunter and became a Killing machine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Sog is not worried about any connection between them and the police and the cult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, the demon hunter belongs to the ruling, hunting witches and cults themselves is their duty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Help! Help! I am chased by the death sect of the dead sorcerer!" Su Ge called for help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to the words of death sect and undead warlock, the middle-aged hunter with a white beard on the left came to the interest, and the sight was just right. I saw Jess rushing over with a pistol. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not good!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the moments of these two demon hunters, Jess Suddenly like a mouse that saw a cat, the roots of the whole body were erected, and a burst of fear emanating from the soul instantly drowned his reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he said nothing, even did not explain, instinctively turned and ran. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged demon hunter did not move, and the young demon hunter with green hair around him gave a look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug only felt a breeze blowing, the hunter had disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the Demon Hunter chasing out, Su Ge breathed a deep sigh of relief and leaned against the wall to breathe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged demon hunter looked at Su Ge with interest and made a hoarse and low voice: "How do you know that we are here? With your present Physical fitness and heart rate, you just ran about 70 meters. The hutong has two corners, a total of 50 meters, the average person does not know what is inside, that person should track you for a while, and suddenly run It seems that a clear purpose has come to us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
