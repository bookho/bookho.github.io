			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gray has never felt such a cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the cold-blooded church, the ghouls who believe in the gloomy gods have excellent cold resistance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, at this moment, Glee feels that his body's cold resistance is so ridiculous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue flame is like a monster that devours all temperatures and lives. It appears from the glove, with horrible power in your body. Spreading and freezing the body quickly swallowed his soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No!" The desire for survival in the desperate environment inspired Gry's original animality, and he suddenly screamed, and the body began to be like a bear. Rapid expansion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This crazy animal has a weird change, and he was smashed by the frozen neck and chest when he swelled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his body has turned into a giant ghoul with a height of five meters in a few breaths. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this Su Ge look is full of caution, and his hands are slamming forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surge of psionic energy is accompanied by the rhythm of knowledge, and the kinetic energy generated by the shock instantly accumulates to a degree of terror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, this huge monster was defeated by Su Ge's vibrations for five or six meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The violent reaction force also retreated the Su Ge back a few meters back to the Roland four. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Abandoning reason and embracing madness. The hidden animal nature is completely erupted, and the irrational brain unwinds the restrictions on the body and enters the crazy form of out of control." Looked at Gry's state at this time, and said with a slight sigh.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But then, he will also go to destruction." Anthony looked at Gry Low said . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The core reason for abandoning reason and being crazy is that it can instantly become stronger, just as Su Ge just said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brain unlocks control of the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any creature has enormous potential and explosive power. But this explosive power is not the form of this creature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just like human beings, when people are experiencing potential, one can lift a few hundred pounds of vehicles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the price of this powerful moment is that the bones cannot withstand the smash of tremendous pressure, and the muscle tissue collapses beyond the load. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in order to ensure the safety of the form, the brain will set limits on the body and prevent people from entering the ruined restricted area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when people give up their minds and embrace madness, everything will be liberated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, it can be seen that the Grae body has not appeared in a similar state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His sturdy muscles gradually appear bloodshot, and the bones on the outer fixed body cannot withstand the swelling muscles and are twisted and broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of blood splatters and bones creaking constantly rang in the night sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's get out of here, this guy is the most dangerous time now," Connor suggested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a senior assassin, he is very good at judging the strength of the goal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, if you fail to judge in the assassination, then you have only one dead end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗷呜呜呜! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a screaming scream in the huge mouth, and the huge body madly rushed toward Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this scene, Su Ge squeezed his cane and sighed and said: "You quickly leave here, just do not see me. If you are seen by us The intersection will be very troublesome. Give it to me here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon hearing this, the four people did not hesitate and turned and left quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now is not the time to revisit the old, they are also very clear about the church's attitude towards Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A muffled sound, Grenada’s huge claws were shot on the ground, and the ground surface was shot with a claw mark that was three centimeters deep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The suffocating Su Ge cloak rushed out, carrying his body quickly back a dozen meters, pulling away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a blow, Grae slowly turned his head and spit out a steamy heat in his huge mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously, his body can't withstand the heat generated by such a huge body during strenuous exercise, and the temperature in the lungs is rising rapidly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes under the Su Ge mask with an indescribable look, looking at the steamed Gry: "intellect and madness, new life and destruction." You abandon your reason for fear of death, but such a result will only make you die more painful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗷嗷嗷! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gray's mouth snorted and his body leaped forward, and the huge body slammed into the hill descending from the sky to Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge naturally did not dare to pick up such a blow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body floats up under the action of vibration and cloak, with the wind, close to the ground and begins to move quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot! boom! boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gray continued to jump up, regardless of the sigh to Su Ge, the huge claws constantly waving, but could not grasp the figure of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After several rounds, snoring...snoring...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; obviously can hear his lungs It seems to be broken, and it makes a burst of ugly sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the mist ejected from the mouth turned from white to red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This shows that his lungs, and even the esophagus, have begun to collapse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pump! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a few breathless breaths, Gry's huge body threw himself to the ground, and the constantly undulating body was full of blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The muscles are broken, the bones are twisted and broken, and the body is unable to support his huge body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This looks like a dying behemoth that has been attacked by a group of monsters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug went to his side and looked down at the huge head lying on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Distorted eyes seem to have recovered a little bit of wisdom, but it is full of pain and despair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you give up resistance, you will die very happy." Su Ge said coldly and calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grena’s huge mouth squirmed slightly, making a hoarse voice: “In the face of death, no existence can be willingly accepted. Even if the front is abyss and Hell, you have to try it. Further, maybe it’s possible to live, it’s stagnant, it can only wait for death.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear’s silence, he Agree to this statement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, humans have been so since ancient times, and there is a word that perfectly interprets this behavior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Drinking and quenching thirst. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why attack these three clergymen?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gray did not respond positively, unable to say: "There are some things you have no choice, there is no way for the best of both worlds."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge did not continue to ask, he could guess who it was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you think the world can be redeemed?" Greg's huge head turned slightly and looked at Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s firm answer: “Yes.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gray makes an unpleasant smile "I didn't believe it when I fell into the mysterious abyss, so I abandoned the human form and mutated into a ghoul."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this Su Ge heart Somewhat surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not expect that Grae was not a natural ghoul, but a human variant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If this is the case, those ghouls that can be incorporated into the mysterious system should all be mutated by humans!" Su Ge suddenly thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greg continues here: "I thought I would become a Yi, and believers who become evil spirits can let me see hope and gain some sense of security. But unfortunately Yes, I became a Yi, and I fell into deeper despair after learning more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge calmly replied: "The world is like this." Ignorance is fearless. Sometimes, ignorance is also a kind of happiness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gleet has a sigh of relief, huge eyes are dying with the disappearance of life Not open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You said...if I was convinced of the human...the possibility, I...will it become this look?" Grae sounds intermittently The coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge did not give an accurate answer: "Who knows, after entering the mystery, it is possible to be ruined at any time."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stop, Su Ge’s words turned: "But one thing is for sure."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can be a good person as a human being."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good guy? Hehehe cough... "I heard that this can only appear in the child's mouth, with a slightly naive word, and Grae smiled a little happy." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laughing, laughing, his body began to violently shake, it seems that something is about to erupt, control his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Kill...I, I don't want to...it devours it." Gly's eyes were full of horror and said hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug did not respond, but silently lifted the cane into a long sword and directly penetrated his huge head, ending his painful life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you." Glory said nothing, slowly closing his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Gly's death, his twitching body gradually subsided, as if that thing stopped working with his death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of the Greg, who was killed, began to shrink rapidly, first becoming a ghoul of the size of a human being, and finally those eccentric fleshes retreated. It became a middle-aged man who looked like a forty years old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this scene, Su Ge remembered the words he saw in "The Evening Clock in Glen." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The relief of the gift of God is not a bloody killing, but a sacred purification. All the filth, all the variability will dissipate in death, return to the original Form. In the most primitive and pure form, madness can be calmed down, despair can be peaceful. It is sacred death, the supreme gift."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the tight hands of the cane, this moment, Su Ge's understanding of the bell people, the death of the valley, and the "night bell of the valley" is more profound, and even has a faint understanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It turned out to be this feeling?" Su Ge looked down at Grae's body and returned to God for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that after a few minutes, Su Ge has returned to God: "Take the secret treasure and quickly leave here, the church people should arrive soon." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Su Ge was preparing to take the peristaltic brain away, suddenly a sharp crescent sword shot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug was a tumbling moment, turning his head just to see the Father Sini, who was holding the moonlight sword, staring at himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only at this time, Father Sini did not have the obvious hostility and fanaticism of the last time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know you." Father Sini took two steps toward Su Ge, with a hint of doubt in his voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has been here for ten minutes, and Su Ge has just made every move to look at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug pulls out the sword: "You don't need to understand, you have your faith, I have my insistence."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to get? The right to rule the people of the world? Or the knowledge of reaching the roots?" Father Cagnes was silent, but did not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug did not respond positively, looked up at the sky and said, "I know the truth of the world, so I will not give my faith to anyone, or Any god."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sini followed up and saw the three rounds of the sacred moon: "The truth of the world you know, may not be the true truth. The world The truth, falsehood is not our decision. Maybe we are just in a nightmare, and the real self has long been lost in the depths of the nightmare."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge heard a heartfelt move, actually thought that Father Sini had some truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French Sini raised the purple sword and looked at it and said, "I have lost it, I have been feared, even crazy. It is like a spring." The moonlight descended from the sky, guiding me out of madness and getting rid of fear. From then on, the truth and falsehood of the world is no longer important to me. I just want to protect this moonlight in my heart forever."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug can't refute the ideas and ideas of Father Sini, and even more can't deny the persistence and belief of Father Sini. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even if this moonlight is false?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even if this moonlight is full of filth?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even if the moonlight itself does not exist?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French Sini’s eyes did not shake anything, and the third firm answer: “Yes.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s hands on his chest and a slight salute: “You have earned my respect.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the face of Su Ge’s sudden salute, Father Sini had some surprises, and he could not return to God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If one day, the world suddenly falls into the doomsday, I believe that you are still you, will not be tainted by filth, will not be infected by madness, more Will not fall into the magic road, turned into a monster." Su Ge in the tone with relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French Sini silently put away the big sword: "Go, today I don't want to do it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sug did not speak, and the body disappeared into the night like a breeze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Suge left, Father Sini came over and looked down at Gry's body and whispered, "Your choice is not wrong."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night wind blew gently. About five minutes later, Archbishop Laurie arrived here with a clergyman and recovered the body of Gry. Father Cagne did not say much, standing on the side and silently watching Laurie take the person to recycle the body of Gry, without saying a word, like a sentence, like Father Sini is an unfamiliar outsider who is completely ignorant of these clergy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he left, Father Sini suddenly said: "How is the Pope?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Laurie did not return, not salty and replied: "Recovery is very good, can already participate in the meeting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Father Sini does not Answer, holding the sword and turning into the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light of the eyes of Laurie looked at the priest Sini, who had a very complicated look in his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Archbishop, the corpse was transported to the chapel, or was it shipped back to the headquarters?" asked the bishop of the team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
