			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a noisy, the person behind Oliver suddenly took out a thick glass bottle from his arms and then threw the bottle out in all directions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哗啦......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the bottle broken, a pale yellow gas quickly in the air The middle is pervasive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a werewolf plague!" The two followers at the door suddenly screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn!" Julie and others saw this, and left without saying anything, turned and ran outside the ballroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least outside, those gases have not spread and have some reaction time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After seeing these gases, Su Ge immediately signaled Randall to leave Vanas quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Virginia instantly hugged Vanas whispered: "Kneeling, hold your breath for thirty seconds."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aside, Hills changed instantly to protect the dragon form. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of Randall, the group quickly rushed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your Majesty, don't abandon us!" At this time, the aristocrats who inhaled the plague continued to cough and screamed in horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugrand said: "You can rest assured that your Majesty will not abandon you. You will only become a werewolf for the time being. Your Majesty already has the right to return to normal." Method."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many aristocrats heard this, the heart is a little bit quiet, although the heart is still frightened, but desperation gradually receded with a hint of hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can't let you go out like this!" For the departure of Julie and the glasses youth, these people did not stop, but when Randall and others are about to When I rushed to the door, I was stopped by five people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Randall grinned: "Open the meal, kids!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hulala...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the voice coming out, with the sound of a flapping of the wings, hundreds of counts from Randall’s black dress The bat, surrounded by five people in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five people never dreamed of it, this seemingly only expert-level guard is actually a high vampire! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These bats are not like the bats of nature, just flying over them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of these bats flying over is to eat meat and drink blood! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the distance is too close, the five people have not even reacted, and everyone has been smashed by bats no less than ten times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Psychic shield!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second time of contact, five people quickly supported The psionic shield protects itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, these bats are terrible, and when they open their mouths, they bite the Psionic Shield and rush in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啊啊啊......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without five seconds, five people are full of blood and body convulsions Fall to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not that they are being killed, but the bat’s mouth is filled with neurotoxins that paralyze the human nerves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five people are now stiff and can't even breathe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Advanced vampire!?" Seeing this, Oliver suddenly looked amazed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existence of this level, even if he does not dare to care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After five people fell, Randall smoothly took Vanas out of the hall and went to the courtyard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter Su Ge ran out with the Prince of Jean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After sending Jean away, Sug turned his head and stood at the door, screaming: "We really don't have much chance of winning, but it's at least a little more than yours."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hearing this, Oliver, who had just ordered a military order against the Lord of the Moon, was so angry that his face was green. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰砰砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A series of bullets came over, but was blocked by the late bell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is the ability to come and catch us!" Su Ge finished, the pace is brisk, and calmly left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This provocation is not a brainless provocation. Now they come to the outside and they join the blood alliance, the dragon flame believers, the overall strength far beyond this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug really hopes that they can take the initiative to fight against them from this plague. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He needs to weaken the opposing fighting ability as soon as possible before the outside plague. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time the courtyard has been flustered, the servants are running out, and the soldiers are now afraid of the plague, but they dare not go in with a gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mystery here, Julie has four people standing here, in addition to her, there is a man with a cheekbones mask, and two wearing bloody red robes. youth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are fewer people in the Dragon Flame believers. There are two people. At this time, two people are standing not far away, staring at Julie and others with vigilance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The masked male eyes stared at Randall with a strong alert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their core knowledge is in the blood, but on the control of the blood, they are not the same as the higher vampires. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be said that Randall can easily suppress four of them and restrain themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge naturally knows that this mask is the main man, laughing and saying: "Although the force field is different, but the current situation, we should still have the possibility of cooperation." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mask man smiled first and easily answered: "Mr. is really a good calculation, so I have counted these people into it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The trend of the times, now The city is surrounded by plague, without their protective equipment, are you sure you can run out?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Juli squinted: "We can hide, but you can't hide."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "If you want to shrink the tortoise, there is no way!" Su Ge's casual hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then what do you do?" Two of the dragon flame believers whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge pointed to the inside: "Take them, we will live."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, everyone’s eyes fell in the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If they don't come out, we can't do anything." Julie whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s calm answer: “Reassured, it’s not just us who are in a hurry, come with me, I have a way to lead them out.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, Su Ge quickly left the courtyard with a group of people and disappeared into the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher! They ran!" The mystery who was hiding in the room now had a white mask, and the mystery near the window saw this. A scene was hurried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oliver seems to have special means, does not need a mask, at this moment his face is gloomy, bite his teeth: "Catch out! I can not let the Lord of the Moon disappointed!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The division of labor between the three people is very clear, and once they fail, the consequences will be very serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Catch out what we don't seem to be an opponent..." The young mystery on the side whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oliver gnawed his teeth: "Even if you die! Take Vanas back to me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
