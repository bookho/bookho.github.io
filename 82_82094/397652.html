			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind of the night~~ Gently blows through<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the faint aroma of the orchid~~ ~<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw my baby shivering~~ asked him what happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lovely Bobby’s pale face says~~~<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am afraid of the corpse in the night Ghosts and Ghosts~~<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a typical dark gothic horror The song echoed in the dimly lit room. A seven- or eight-year-old girl was hiding under the bed with a pale face. A pair of eyes full of horror looked at the blood that gradually spread and spread on the ground, trying to keep herself from shouting. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This blood is her mother's. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咔哒! Hey! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feet with sharp claws step on the wooden floor and make a harsh sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little girl saw the two claws slowly approaching the bed through the gap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little girl was scared and her body was constantly shaking, and her cute little face was a little blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tick! Tick! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The saliva with blood is slowly falling on the gray nanmu floor. Slowly, a face is festering, his eyes are pale, and his mouth full of fangs slowly appears in front of the little girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! Ah, ah! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this face, the little girl suddenly made a very screaming scream, her face feared and even twisted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Excessive frightening caused the little girl's eyes to turn white, and the body fainted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghoul at the bed stretched out his claws and looked greedy to pull the little girl out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that this poor little girl is about to become a ghoul’s belly meal, a burst of low-pitched bells coming from the towering bell tower in the middle of the city. The thick sound waves slowly pushed around, so that all the humans heard were in peace and soon went to sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this kind of sleepy bell has a weird and mysterious power that makes this ghoul full of stiffness, and the instinct of the heart appears a little trembling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is the story of this bell?" Ghoul is not ignorant, but has a clear sense of reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gods they believe in are the ghoul kings who have endless knowledge. Their insights and spirits are far more tough than normal people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound that makes them feel trembling is definitely not an ordinary bell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the ghoul meditates, a clear, with a little unpleasant voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have a long face that is too tragic? It’s really in line with your beliefs, and it’s ugly."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghoul’s pale eyes flashed a violent violent violent violent look, just as he saw a human being appearing in the bedroom door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This human figure is tall, dressed in a neat white shirt, black suit, a black silk top hat, and a silver cane in his hand. Wearing bright black shoes on his feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the ignorant human being dare to appear in front of us? Is it stupid or you are timid?" The ghoul said, suddenly around There are three more similar ghouls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All face is rotten, his eyes are pale, his mouth is sharp and his teeth are terrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge smiled and helped the top hat on the head, revealing a silver-gray shield-shaped badge on the left side of the courtesy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a big clock on the badge with a spear in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dare to face us, you should also be a mystery who thinks you have excellent knowledge, which organization you are, this sign is not a sinner, not a night watchman, not a substitute." The left ghoul whispered Road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Accurately, the city's defense system has not yet formed, there is no such organization!" the last ghoul added. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghoul’s wisdom is active, dare to hunt here, and naturally conducted a very in-depth investigation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s finger tapped the handle of the cane: “It seems that you are really prepared.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't talk nonsense with him, kill!" The ghoul said, holding out his claws, and his body swooped toward Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is very fast, and ordinary people can’t dodge at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A low-pitched gunshot sounded, the ghoul was shot with a shot and flew out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ordinary bullets for us...ah!" The ghoul who was pierced by the head waited for a scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its head melted rapidly, like a dissolved ice, with an unpleasant smell, and died completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a beautiful silver revolver in his hand, and he raised his head to reveal a clean, white face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that this handsome face is a little unpleasant and cold: “The night is the place where the reverberations are, my land. Ghouls, you can I have passed away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, I felt the momentum of Su Ge, and the remaining three ghouls didn’t feel good. Broke the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment they hit the wooden window, they suddenly felt themselves hitting a thick iron plate and stunned them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a psionic barrier?" The ghoul on the left slammed up and found that the invisible wall still exists, its fists are like a squat On the transparent metal wall, the window could not be touched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said, you can die." Su Ge was not anxious, and the calm voice came again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three gloomy ghouls turned their heads and saw that Sug didn’t know when they had come to three people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰砰砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The very ordinary silver-gray cane is skillfully flipped in his hand, and a random wave is swept over the three people, just touching them gently The body did not cause any harm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This suddenly looked at the three ghouls, then shouted: "Are you funny? Human?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge ignored the three ghouls, bent over and took the little girl under the bed, watching the little girl being scared of the blue face and sighing: "You are lucky." Not good, the probability of a thousandth is met by your family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little girl and mother are not the aborigines of the studio, they are foreign Workers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Human!" A nearby ghoul seized the opportunity and his claws snapped to Su Ge's heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But he just stepped forward, but suddenly his mouth spurted blood, and his body twitched and fell to the ground and quickly died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This weird scene scared two other ghouls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Listen to the sound of this night, where the sound waves are, you are the restricted area." Su Ge said indifferently, holding the little girl out of the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two ghouls still want to talk, but they feel a cramp in the chest, and then a feeling of suffocation came and fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside the apartment, the other four ghouls hidden in the shadows fell to the ground and were dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't... don't kill me!" On the side, four young men in night clothes squatted on the floor, his face pale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After four people’s stepping on, they led the eight ghouls into the shadow city, the ghouls were ready to eat, and the four guys were ready to do some Robbing qj's filthy activities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four ghouls who dive first have already succeeded in the next door. They saw that there was no problem, so they were ready to do so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, what they never imagined was that after they sneaked into a family to prepare, the newlyweds turned into awkward werewolves instantly. Give the powerful ghoul to life and die! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside them, Prince Jean’s face was a bit gloomy under the moonlight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aside, the six werewolves gradually returned to the form of normal residents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were three families attacked, one was a foreigner of a little girl, and the two were local residents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "His Royal Highness, let the bishops personally take the shot, does it seem that we are too incompetent?" A strong-skinned resident touched the blood on his mouth, his demeanor Some flaws. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jean smiled: "Don't worry, today's Catholics come out and want to move their muscles."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh!" Several people nodded with a peace of mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These thieves, these ordinary residents can solve it, now let the noble and powerful bishops personally pick up the despicable monsters, which makes them very I don’t want to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The bishop is so embarrassed," the female werewolf looked apologetic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the bishop, they have been admiring for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is the savior of the entire returning city, and the bells of the bishops have changed them from the werewolf to humans, and also the bells of the bishops. Let them save their senses in the form of werewolves, and they can sleep peacefully every day, and their mental state is getting better and better, completely away from chaos and violent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, the bishop is also the savior of the Queen and the prince, and their asylum, the savior of the entire Guinness Kingdom. According to the prince, the Church of the Holy Blood had intended to clean up these werewolves, but the bishops protected them through their own abilities so that they could continue to live in peace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even according to the aristocrats who did not intend to talk about it, Her Majesty the Queen favored the young and handsome bishop. The two men even secretly joined together. The Queen is the queen on the bright side, and the bishop is the emperor in the dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no objection to this kind of speech and situation. After experiencing fear and despair before, Su Ge’s existence is like their reborn parents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city is down to the prince, up to the Marquis prince, all respected the bishop's heart from the heart of the deep respect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When several people talked about it, Sug came over with the little girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How's it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people listened to the rush, and Jean immediately said: All of them are processed, and the four thieves are left."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bishop...Adult, begging..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After waiting for the four thieves to finish, Su Ge handed the little girl to the priest who was waiting for him, faintly said: "Kill it, the body is clean."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Following." Hearing this, these residents showed a bloodthirsty smile on their lips. Under the shadow of the moon, the human body quickly became a two-meter-high high-powered werewolf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't...do not..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The harsh screams sounded in the night sky, very Piercing. However, this did not attract the attention of any residents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because they have become accustomed to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All foreigners who are unscrupulous are damned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night wind blew, accompanied by a bat slid through the air, three vampires descended from the sky, and brought three mysterious people who fainted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Bishop adults, these three mysterious people intend to hold some weird summoning rituals, how to deal with them?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Su Ge’s hands were behind him, and the moon watching the sky arbitrarily said, “Give it to Master Mill.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current Master Mill is the editor of the Holy Blood Church. The clergyman is responsible for the interrogation and pursuit of the prisoner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three vampires immediately vacated and disappeared into the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bishop, a new batch of goods arrived tomorrow, including the reserve of blood therapy and related medical personnel, as well as related books needed by the Holy Blood Library. "On the side, Jean reports. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, as a deputy to Su Ge, Jean handles the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let Karato walker to dock, I walked around the city these few days, this month really ruined me." Su Ge said, When the hand of the shopkeeper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This month, Su Ge’s work intensity is catching up with Vanas, with only four hours of sleep per day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is very hard, the results are gratifying. At the beginning, most of the plans made by Kara and others have been completed, and the clock of the clock tower has had some simple effects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emilia also agreed to Su Ge’s request, I can transfer Ivan, Anthony, Roland, etc., but wait for a while, and here Before she had to send some people who belonged to her to settle here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the most important thing is that with the constant efforts of Vanas and the nobles, 60% of the residents of the entire city are now mysterious people who can fight at any time! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although 90% of them do not know the existence of the Church of the Night, they have begun to worship Su Ge himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The actual situation is just like the scene, people who don’t know come in only one dead end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jean asked curiously here: "A few days ago, the Archbishop came. How do you plan to deal with these "outsiders"?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug squinted and smiled: "In the sound of the late bell, they don't want to get out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
