			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the ward, Anthony and Marlene have sat up and are talking to Harden and Ivan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bishop, what is the situation?" asked Father Hank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge calmly replied: "The murderer is Bryce, but Bryce is also a beggar. After I just revealed him, he dropped it. I have escaped."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear this, everyone is a little heavy inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You should take good care of your injuries first. Give this to me." Su Ge didn't say too much, and then he turned and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Return to the Cathedral of the Holy Blood with Lobo, who is alive and kicking. This man is a carriage and goes to the home of Bryce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The house of Bryce has now been completely encircled by the church and the police, just in case, the relevant people inside have also been temporarily evacuated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"See Bishop!" Seeing Suge coming, the line of people respectfully bowed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly: "Take me to Bryce's home."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes A priest who nodded happily and took Su Ge to Bryce's home along some dilapidated corridors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh! Oops! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soles step on the dilapidated wooden floor, and Suge looks around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rooms in the two rooms are similar to the houses of ordinary people, and there is no one at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Luobo, looking for the taste of books. Resonating with the Grail documents, it is definitely not an ordinary book." Su Ge said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luobo’s screaming, turned his head and showed his expertise in breaking the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strong body is like a whirlwind, and like a bear child, there is no place to survive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nose keeps sniffing, the two claws are grabbed here, digging and digging, and when necessary, open your mouth and bite...<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The drawer of the table was pulled open, the legs of the table were bitten, and the carpet on the ground was scratched, but in ten minutes, the home that was just neat and clean was already terrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is not idle, and now in Bryce’s study, all the books here have a certain relationship with the annihilated Byron Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening a few books, Su Ge found that most of them are wild legends, and some even say that the people of the entire Byron Empire have become gods and become heavenly star. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The imagination of a person is really rich enough." Su Ge saw this and couldn't help but smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗷呜! Hey! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of Su Ge’s reading, Luo Bo did not know how to break a solid floor and create a copy of it. Very new books. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge took the book from the dog's mouth and looked at it. The book's name is "Byron's Travel Manuscript"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The book page is very new, the material is ordinary, it should be the new white page book in the recent period, 10 Langke one ordinary goods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This should be the book he said." Su Ge thought about opening the book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Byron's Travels is one of the most famous and mysterious books in the mystery. It is rumored that after Byron's great knowledge gained, he did not immediately form an empire. He used his dream power to sleep for hundreds of years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He spent three thousand years in the middle of the night, went to many places, saw a lot of weird situations, and experienced a lot of things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rumors include ancient civilizations, ancient races, dragons, undead people, and even gods living in the sky, the leprechauns of the asylum islands, supporting the world. Pillars and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People are pretty sure that the book does exist, and even someone has been lucky enough to see a page of a book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rumored Byron travel was written by Byron the Great, and then because of the mysterious power of being too powerful, the law could not exist in the world after the change of the law, the whole book fell apart, It became a page by page. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mysterious world now has a lot of high-powered mysteries, and is very keen to collect the pages of Byron's travels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Manuscript? Do he have the entire Byron travel?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge I thought about looking down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the content makes Su Ge more disappointing, because the words on the pages of the book are twisted, it seems that many black bugs are lying on it, and there is no meaning at all. And shape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second page is completely black, as if it were directly blacked out by ink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third page can only see a spiral-like stick figure, surrounded by black spots, so that people can't touch the mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge frowned, these things he could not understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close the book with a hand, a letter fell from the book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge first scans with the spirit to confirm that there is no problem and then open the new one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few words written on the letterhead in beautiful swashes, and the writing is not completely dry. It seems that it has not been written for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dear Bishop Sog Sotos, I am very glad that you can see this letter. If you see this letter, you should have already finished talking to "I" and you should know some secrets. There isn't a lot of content here, and it's a file I've encrypted with ancient Byrondias text and totem. Without the Holy Grail file, you can't decipher the secret. But I believe that getting the Holy Grail file is not difficult for you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, things don't go smoothly. I have actually observed you for a long time. I know that you are a different kind of person. You can't see the despair of this world in your eyes, but it is full of weird hope. I sometimes think that you may not be the world person, maybe your soul is not covered by the color of March. Your soul is like the rainbow of this black and white world, so dazzling. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Su Ge suddenly jumped in his heart: "This can be seen? How much can this mystery cover!!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come, this mystery seems to be omnipotent, the color of the soul, the mind in the heart can see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hand holding the stationery slowly squeezed, and Sug squinted: "This is the level of the master, and there are lords on it, and Sage, the character is not even more horrible, more strange!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Su Ge is suddenly full of caution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continue to look down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to show my respect for you, I decided to tell a secret that you are very interested in. Of course, this secret comes at a price. The price is that I have to create a problem for you. As for what the trouble is, it depends on the timing of discovering our secrets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So let me say the secret happily, haha! In fact, I am not good at keeping secrets. I can tell secrets that others don't know. It is a very enjoyable thing for me. Unfortunately, I can't say it to you face to face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are seven ancient gods, who are the true aborigines of the whole world, the beginning of all things, and symbolize the seven origins of the whole world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;soul, temperature, wisdom, element, light and dark, sound, life and death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, the holy grails in the three churches are wisdom, elements, and light. There are also four holy grail left outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have mastered the Holy Grail of the Soul. If you want the Holy Grail, you must not only get the Holy Grail documents, unlock our secrets, but also prepare me for you. Trouble! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking forward to our next real meeting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the name of a woman is actually: Shelly Byron Diaz. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s attention was not on that name, but rather a deep contemplation of the message about the ancient god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Seven Holy Grail, seven origins... If the ancient god is the aboriginal, then the March goddess is essentially indistinguishable from those outside God, and is an outsider to the world."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But outsiders don't mean bad things. The reason why human beings can multiply on such a large scale, this and the March goddess kill ancient gods, formulate new world rules, and implement the visual system. A huge relationship. With the ultimate form of the seven ancient gods standing in the roots, as long as they exist, human beings have no possibility of development. They are slaves of their own, or food."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking, Su Ge folded the letter into the pocket of his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Holy Grail is the condensation of the ancient gods. It is the fastest way for human beings to reach the roots. Since it is the origin of the world, it represents the world. The most primitive power. If... If I need to fight against those outsiders in the future, then I must master this power and unite this power."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Thinking of this, Su Ge suddenly had a bold idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants...to collect seven holy grailes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So this time, aim at the Holy Grail of the Soul!" Su Ge was not being beaten by the applause at this time, but his heart was surging. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he has finally found his own clear goal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you want to do, what you can do, what the goals are, these have been thought of before, but there is no clear thing, or some specific actions on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that he wants to shelter the witch, he said that to redeem the world, this is the ultimate goal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of how to operate, through what way he is not clear, but also somewhat vague, and even has not found a suitable method. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But seeing this today, Su Ge’s heart suddenly thought of this clear goal, or the path of action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Grail is his main goal today, which is the main task that Su Ge has just triggered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
