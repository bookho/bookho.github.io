			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contents of the three books are not many, and Su Ge spent less than two hours to finish reading. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general situation is similar to what Mill said, but it explains why you want to hide future generations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the instability of the god of death, while serving the god of death, the Guinness family is also the caretaker who takes care of the god of death in place of the Church of the Holy Blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, in order to prevent others from knowing the true existence of the god of death, self-directed self-directed appearances have emerged today. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, when the Guinness family was the core force of the Berant Empire, the sudden exile would definitely lead to suspicion and constant temptation from all parties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, Su Ge noticed some special places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the inheritance of the god of death, the Guinness family is born with the affinity and talent for death knowledge, and has a good mysterious constitution, so this Women in the physique are very easy to mutate into witches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a reminder that if a witch is determined to exist, please send the witch to the Church’s Holy Blood Maze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Holy Blood Maze... What kind of existence is it?" Su Ge is not the first time to hear the name, the more the bloody maze The more curious you are. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Su Ge noticed a very inconspicuous statement in the text. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every great god longs for his own children, but then kills his own children. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The child of God needs a mother, a pure virgin of pure law. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is the base, she is the umbilical cord, she is the cradle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In contemplation, Su Ge left Mill's study to the courtyard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the bright sunshine in the afternoon, I can't feel the leisure and relaxation of the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have now got two senior staff, a necromancer, a stalker. They should be the top fighting power on the opposite side. They are the masters of the master class Oliver. We also have witches, Vegginia, and Randall, which should be equal to each other in combat effectiveness."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They plan that the details are still unclear, but from the current situation, the general direction and purpose are already known. Not surprisingly, the core should be the one between Vanas and the royal temple. Well. Without these two, even if everyone in the entire Guinness Kingdom becomes a werewolf, they will not succeed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But here is the future To be the core territory of our church, of course, we cannot let the people here leave. The core question now is to determine when the plagues will start and what is the way to launch them. I hope that Randall can bring me back some Message."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking, Su Ge remembered the sound of a wing flapping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turning around, with a burst of dark bats, Randall’s face is not so good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened?" Seeing Randall like this, Su Ge stood up and his heart gradually lowered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Randall replied earnestly: "They are accelerating production, I have overheard their conversation and should be able to produce it later today. As for When I used it, and I did not ask which way to spread it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This group of guys is very alert and fanatical, I caught three people Asked, they directly bite the poisonous pouch in their mouth and committed suicide. I intended to rush into destroying some pharmacy and facilities, but three people have been killed in succession. They seem to have been prepared and responded very quickly and comprehensively. I quickly evacuated in order to hide myself." Speaking of this, Randall looked helpless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg nodded with satisfaction: "I just killed them a very powerful stalker last night, and they are estimated to be as scared as they are now. It’s very good to get the time nodes for their production completion.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The gas container is very weird. I wanted to bring back a bottle. As a result, I just got the test tube and blew it up. I almost got it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp After hearing this, Su Ge found that this group of madmen is very fanatical and evil, but the degree of caution and IQ are really not low, and can actually take this degree into consideration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You should go ahead and prepare, you should be leaving soon," said Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Randall nodded slightly and fell back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking, Su Ge told this information to Mill. After listening to it, he said: "There are only two ways to cover the whole journey, one is to spread through the air, and the other is to pass the city's tap water. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you have to be prepared, now you are going to start drinking water in the palace, and it is best to detect the air in the palace through some arrays." Situation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is no problem, just give it to me." Mill looked confident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly, turned and prepared to leave, he had to prepare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh! Right!" Mill screamed and handed Sugg eight black bottles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the four potions you can use, two bottles each. Remember, you can't use both, and more than two. Yes, the interval between the use of each potion must be one hour after the effect of the drug subsides, in order to continue to use it, understand?" Mill's face is full of warning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug took the potion and answered seriously: "Reassured, I cherish my life most."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, the entire palace was obviously able to feel busy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole is divided into two parts, one is centered on the Queen, preparing for the feast, and the other side is centered on Mill to carry out the defense of the Imperial City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
