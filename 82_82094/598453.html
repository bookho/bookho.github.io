			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugben intends to go back and prepare for the party’s costumes, but halfway to meet their Marquis captain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Assassin, Mrs. Assassin." Marchi nodded slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shelly looked at her and did not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg asked: "What's wrong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The captain needs your help." Marchi said seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded: "Lead the way!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five people followed the corridor Go to the captain's room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five minutes later, Captain Macock looked at Su Ge with a sullen look: "This must have been done by the accused accused, they believe in Cthulhu The rumor is the god of the sea, which controls all the monsters in the sea."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expert mystery advisory class on the side asked seriously: "Have you seen it? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge sat on the sofa and asked casually, "What about the Krakens? See you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Then you are not planning to take any measures? They have already caused us a huge threat," Makok said solemnly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge raised his head and asked curiously: "What measures does the captain want to take?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;马When Cooke heard this question, he was angry and whispered: "Mr. Assass, if I know what I can do, I won't ask you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg heard this and smiled: "Oh! That's a shame, let's change one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Su Ge asked Road: "What measures can the captain hope to take? I am a lazy person, and I don't like to calculate too detailed plans."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marchi immediately said: "Of course I hope that you can kill all these Krakens."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Impossible!" The class said loudly at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, everyone’s attention was drawn to the class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The class color is dignified: "The Kraken is a group of monsters, usually the entire tribe moves together, the number is between 20 and 50, and the combat power is very Strong and strong, and strong defense. I checked it roughly today. There are about thirty Krakens wandering around the ship. If you can’t kill it, let them attract companions, they will be besieged in a moment. The damage to the hull will be very serious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard this, Malkiton looked down and said nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Macock’s face was very ugly, I don’t know what to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge still sat there with ease and asked: "The captain, the measures that Captain Markey is hoped for, is your hope?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Macock heard this and instinctively nodded: "Yes, but since the difficulty is too big, then..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under waiting for him to finish, Su Ge stood up and said: "Since it is the measure that the captain hopes, then I will go to the implementation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Ah!???"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These three people suddenly heard a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the three men were stunned, Su Ge had already walked toward the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please wait!" The class hurried forward to stop Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge looked at him unexpectedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Kraken’s combat power is very strong, and he is good at coordinating combat. So a large number of Krakens, even master mysteries, dare not do it easily. You are like this. Not too risky."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge didn't say much, smiled and patted him on the shoulder, and said to Macock, who hadn't returned to God, "Give me an hour."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp After that, take Shirley out and leave the three people below. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the captain’s room, Shirley asked: “Ready to expose your settings?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Suge nodded slightly: "My setting is a bit more. Let them know some of my settings as a swordsman. This will not only make the mice of the Cthulhu Regiment feel at ease, but also let Huangshazhi The worms of the Brotherhood of the Kings thought they had completed the task."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley accidentally said: "Sword-style? Is this your body?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge confidently said: "I am the master-hunting demon, and after the analysis of the body and long-term exercise. It is no exaggeration to say that I am now only for the body. The use and combat skills have reached the level of experts, but there is no relevant means."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl looked at Sue’s seemingly thin body. A faint saying: "Then you come to perform."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, it is the performance time of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg seems to be very calm, first go back to the bedroom and take out his cane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it came out, there was a sudden rain in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a hand, the cane becomes an umbrella, and Suge walks out calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shelly took a completely dark umbrella, which was a dark condensate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking in the rain is like a couple walking in the rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a room not far away, Markoc, Ban, Marchi stared at the two people who were walking in the rain, and the expression was still unbelievable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially the class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Insane! It's crazy! It's raining outside, it's just the area of ​​the Kraken. In this case, eight or nine Krakens can easily kill a master." The face was very ugly, murmured. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Macock’s rough hands are slowly tightening, whispering: “I believe in the general’s vision.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Markey blinked with curiosity and looked at Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, many people’s eyes are staring at Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This includes Moss of the Brotherhood of the Yellow Emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was very proud at this time, because his plan was successful, and the Kraken that he was attracted to not only killed three Cthulhu churches, even Forcing Su Ge completely out will reveal the true ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come on!" Moss gathered all the spirit and looked at Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, there were two wandering Krakens in front of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bathing in the rain, their bodies are up two full laps, the body is full two meters high, and the scales are as hard as iron, glittering with metal Gloss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is their field, where they are invincible," Ban said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two Krakens after seeing Su Ge, suddenly the golden erect reveals a greed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the body is like a shark in the sea, sliding over Susie at a very fast speed on the water, and his arm is caught in the head of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty meters away, they came to Su Ge in less than two seconds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is very calm, and at the moment when he meets two sea monsters, the intensive strengthening of the body is instantly activated, and at the same time the umbrella becomes a Very sharp sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;唰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
