			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After two years, I will meet again, and the two will hug first according to the setting of the brother and sister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time he was held in his arms by Su Ge, Bernice’s heart suddenly jumped and accelerated, his face was reddish and his eyes sparkled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, she feels that she has come to the happiest moment in her life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, she is very aware of the identity of the two, the disparity between the two, she has decided to put that admiration and love in the heart forever treasure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After normal hug, Bernice returned to normal, and said happily: "Long time no see, cousin."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg was very pleased and nodded: "Yes, cousin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Su Ge said to her: "This is My fiancée, Azshara Assassin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello, Mrs. Assassin." Bernice is a very standard salute, in tone Respect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley seems to have a good impression on Bernice, and at the same time she is curious. When she looks at her, she nods slightly: "very good self-control ability."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where can Bernis’s expressions and small movements hold her? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because she was a little surprised at the precise self-control ability of Bernice, this self-control ability should be the strongest among all the people she saw. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benice was a little embarrassed, but his face still smiled and said: "Thank you for your compliment, I am ready for the carriage, my home is here." Not far away, all the way, take a break first!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge’s pretending to hear nothing to say: "Great, finally can Take a break."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a vibrating master, he is very clear about the changes in the heart of Bernice, but there are some things that cannot be clarified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, under the leadership of Bernice, three people took a carriage to the residence of Bernice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Best Street, 3411, Bernice's apartment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you walked into the apartment and closed the door, the maid at home was excited and said with respectful respect: "I have seen the clockman."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bell of the church in the late bell is a legend for many believers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the system of the church of the late bell, the bell is a person who represents the gods, walks in the world, spreads the consciousness and glory of the gods, and even understands it as a god. Incarnation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clockman has no subordinates. However, it has absolute rights over the Pope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, the glorious deeds of the bell people have been passed down in the church, including church planting, hosting witches, repelling cults, saving the weak, spreading the gods and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially in the past few days, Mr. Zhong Ren also prevented the advent of the evil spirits and brought a prisoner of evil spirits to the great Lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This legendary experience has made almost all believers admire the clock people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The side of Bernice said respectfully: "She is called Beve Faulkner, the witch I saved a year ago, 19 years old this year. The witch's ability is to control the soil. She was born in the farmer's home on the outskirts of Hui Yao City and awakened her ability in planting potted plants."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beverly said with a gratitude "At the time, I was very scared. I met the bishop in panic. After that, the bishop gave me a new life. I also taught me to control my abilities and disguise myself. Now no other outsider knows my identity."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is the greatest privilege and happiness of my life to join the church of the late bell and serve the great Lord." When it comes to this, Beverly looks happy and peaceful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The side of Shirley looked at this short and cute girl and said, "You believe that you are right."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled: "The Lord of Faith can be happy and peaceful, but don't forget the doctrine that my Lord has appointed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Bever heard a face and said: "Yes! Never forget."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two girls in the big family, Bernice explained: "The place here The law and order is relatively good, there are very few ordinary cases, and there are almost no cases of burglary and harassment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beverly secures the luggage, turns to smile and sings the song to the kitchen tea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three people sat down and Su Ge removed the disguise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Bernice saw the true look of Shirley, the look was full of shock and surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the one hand she is wondering how there are such beautiful women in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, there are even some flaws in the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She found that only such a perfect non-human monster can deserve the great identity of the bell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Talk about the current situation." Sug cut into the theme. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benice immediately nodded and said: "The situation in the capital is relatively complicated. There are a lot of forces here. The organizations I know with my teachers so far include the Fuguo women. Warlocks, Witch Rescue, Cold Church, Polar Institute, Royal Family, Three Great Churches, Glorious Church, Sandy Travelers, and the recently emerging Brotherhood of the Yellow King."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So much? What are they going to do here?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benedict replied: "Most of them are hidden, observing the movements and policies of the three churches, and maintaining the network of organizations here. Many people They have already seen the contradiction between the royal family and the Church of the Holy Blood. They all hope to occupy a position."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge sneered: "The Church of the Holy Blood is so good If the world has long been easy to change, they don't understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benice replied: "Because they understand it, they are so risky." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is silent for one second: "Related to the witch hunting delay?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
