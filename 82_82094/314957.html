			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the respectful attention of the public, Su Ge walked into the palace to rest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people who are truly loyal to the royal family are well aware of how dangerous and vicious these two members have done. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the morning, everyone can feel the smile of the past, the temperament and the calm Master of Mir become irritable, gloomy, and even faint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a master of Mir makes everyone very afraid, and let Master Mill become the culprit of this kind, the two renegade members who betrayed His Majesty! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the atmosphere of the entire palace became depressed and dignified, Mr. Sotos came back. He not only brought back the captives of the local high-level, but also the two A damn traitor brought it back, even listening to the master saying that the information they stole did not leak out, and was taken back by Mr. Sotos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, everyone sighed with relief and was grateful and respectful to this foreigner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The eyes of Her Majesty are really the most accurate in the world!" Soldiers, thought of the same in mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The return of Su Ge’s resurgence quickly spread to the nervous and tangled Vanas, and after hearing this series of news, she wanted to run directly. Go out and hug Sug's thighs and express your gratitude and affection to the Pope with the most sincere and grateful gesture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hurry to drop the official business at hand, under the guard of Vegniya, carrying a skirt, running high heels in the hallway, as if a desire See the little girl of the beloved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I came to the inner courtyard of the palace, I just saw the back of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the heart is very lost, she quickly cleans up her expression and expression,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; just coming over I heard the conversation between Randall and Mill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These people were planted by my servants, and as long as they dared to move, I let them smash and die." Randall's words Passed over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Milne said, "Let me hand over to me. So important people can't let them have a chance to die. My potion will make them unable to survive, and die, including this Hayden." Everything spit out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas came quietly and watched the two members who fell to the ground and fainted, his face changed immediately It's as cold as a million years old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My grandfather, the three mysterious people will be handed over to you, and the two men will hand it over to me." Cold, high-ranking Queen's voice came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mill naturally knows the Queen’s disposition and nods: “No problem, but don’t do it, this person will dirty your hand.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas nodded slightly, his mouth slightly tilted, revealing a sinister smile: "Their pleading, crying will be heard in me over the years. The most beautiful temperament."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captives were quickly assigned and everyone started their busy schedules. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mill did not immediately interrogate, and the three people simply dealt with it, soaked in the demon potion, removed all their mysterious abilities, and Rand Collaboration continues with his previous work: cleaning up the internal spies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the morning, with the cooperation of two people, I found three maids, two guards, two guards, and a chef and maid. Nine spies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the threat of potions, these people’s arrogance and rhythm speak out of everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people came from various nobles, as well as the Duke of the Mountains. The main command is at the critical moment as a response, and daily monitoring of the situation in the palace and the state of the queen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After checking these people, the next is the Royal Guard and Logistics staff in the palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The various departments in the palace are doing their work in an orderly manner. Because the two spies are caught back, everyone feels much better and their mindset is much easier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The traitor was caught on the one hand, and on the other hand they finally knew Mr. Sotos’s reliability and strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a huge boost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twilight is very, Vanas is refreshing from the interrogation room, slightly raised mouth with a demon smile, the soles of high heels Something is contaminated with blood, but she doesn't care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just witnessed the two guys being cut into adult sticks in a heartbreaking mourning and begging for mercy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she did not do it, but moved. She lifted her high heels and stepped into the eyes of Fulin and Arthur with the high heeled heels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scream, because of the trembling body, the pleasure of the blood splatter seems to faintly awaken something deep inside her heart, Make her feel refreshed and excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Maria on the side looked down at the Queen, because the Queen’s squatting state seemed awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas did not immediately return to the palace, standing in front of the window of the corridor, watching the bloody red sunset, licking his bloody lips, the scarlet eyes More and more bright, it seems that something is slowly waking up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maria, do you know? Until today, I really felt the joy and pleasure of wearing this crown." Vanas’s voice is still That way, noble, mature, nice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Maria faintly felt that the voice under his arm became a little hoarse, this hoarseness is not the kind of hoarseness, this hoarseness makes the squat The sound becomes more and more textured and more majestic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This shows that you have adapted to this position and become a true great king." Maria said respectfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas pushed open the window, and the white palm stretched out the bloody red sunset between the two mountains, and the tone said with an unquestionable voice: "The so-called king is to be more thorough than everyone else, to be wild. Grasp everything that belongs to you, conquer all that you desire, destroy everything that you hate, kill all the traitors, and step on all enemies. At the foot. This is the king!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will implement this my own kingdom, so I have two goals."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
