			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the carriage on the side of the road, Mr. Arthur and Mr. Forlin sat on the side, opposite the two men, the teacher John and the fat middle-aged people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Ross, how can we stop here? Should we return things back as soon as possible?" said Arthur Arthur. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last night, the two MPs contacted the two powerful mysteries and got two things like spheres. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This morning they were accompanied by John and entered the palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two members are responsible for recording the rules of the entire circle and related runes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John is responsible for vigilance, and at the same time set a few "nails" at some key points<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp After perceiving the mil's body through the mysterious costume, the four people quickly left. In order to prevent being tracked, the carriage went all the way to the outer city. After a round of laps, they returned to the inner area through the Central Ring and collected the two together. The things that were handed over to the leader of the Institute of Polar Studies: Dr. Salo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at the beginning, the two members were shocked by a strange mysterious battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage did not stop at the time. After two people glanced at it, they hurriedly covered their eyes and did not look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are incomprehensible existences, and ordinary people seeing mysterious battles can easily lead to rapid growth of vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then after a while, the two mysterious people across the street suddenly stopped the carriage after whispering a few words, which made the two people somewhat worried. At this time, two people opened the door and went down. The two members turned their heads carefully and saw through the window that they were wearing a brown jacket and the lower body was The youth of light blue jeans came over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the carriage, John tempted and asked: "What happened to the bishop?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man’s face shook his head: “Let him run, this group of bugs is prepared, they should be a trio.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The young man showed a sneer: "But the problem is not big. The guy caught my bullet and couldn't live."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man said: "Seeing Hayden Bishop."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This young man named Hayden nodded slightly: "You have improved very well, continue, and you will soon be able to enter the ranks of experts."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mysterious professions of the two people are dead warlocks, and the route is similar, so Hayden is not bad for this middle-aged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your guidance." The middle-aged man said with joy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John said here: "The Bishop is kneeling, the person who is just standing next to you is the Queen."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? How do you know?" Hayden asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John explained: "He is a student I used to be in the Bertrand Empire..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Said in a simple way, Hayden said: "That can't let him live."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Well, he has almost no mysterious ability, last time When he was arrested, he was saved by a passing exile. This time I have to grab him back." John is confident and clenches his fists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hayden did not stop: "Go, I am waiting for you both in the car."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Hayden turned and sat in the carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello... Bishop." Forint and Arthur said a little trembling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How great is this adult, they are very clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heiden nodded slightly, and had no interest in this ordinary person, leaning his arms on his side and closing his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, two people easily found Su Ge, who had not yet gone far. After locking the target, he made a simple tail and determined that the exile was no longer there. He quickly went straight to Su Ge and planned to take it down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The front of Su Ge seems to have some sense, suddenly turned back to see two people and then ran away, then turned and plunged into an alley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are a stupid student, didn't you teach last time?" Fat middle-aged laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John followed the sneer and said: "If he is really smart, it will not be so easy for me to be a guinea pig, go!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When two people rushed into the Hu, they found that the alley had no way, it was a place to store daily garbage: "It’s really stupid to get home."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge wandered in this dead end where daily garbage was stored, with some reminiscence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of hutong is not the first time he came. I remember that it was the second day of my resurrection. When he was chased by the police of the death church, he also fled. In such a dead end, I met the master of Gerlos who decided the road after him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Some experiences of life really are a circle. Whenever you start, there will definitely be a similar closed loop." Sug squeezed with black The palm of the glove has a confident smile on the corner of the mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is now compared to the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the wall that is five meters high enough in front, Su Ge stops,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The woman returned, that is to say, the cowboy of the death sect did not leave nearby. It happened that the two men appeared nearby, that is to say that these two people are likely to have joined the cowboy. The man from The ability and the gas field should be regarded as the core figures with high status. It seems that this bait is still useful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my heart, the footsteps have come to the body. Before, Su Ge turned his head calmly, and the eyes under his hat just saw two people coming out from the corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
