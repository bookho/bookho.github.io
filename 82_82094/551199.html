			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foggy mountains gathered a lot of people at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Grail is the origin of the world, and every time it appears, it will cause a huge storm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, although the range of black goat eggs has changed very little, it is still difficult to escape the judgment of the major organization astrologers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At noon, the horrific lineup came to the Misty Mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time came over three steel battleships. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three steel warships are from the March church, although the three archbishops are still leading, but these three archbishops are the terrorist characters of the Holy Grail maze. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The March Church is still only one aspect, and you can also see other steel warships and airships. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This includes the Glorious Church, the Fortress, and the Elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They received a report yesterday, and after the divination by the astrologer, they unexpectedly found that the incident here far exceeded their previous expectations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a more powerful force added. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, at least two thousand people of various forces gathered outside the eggs of the black goats, and the three archbishops of the Holy Blood Maze looked carefully and then looked around. Make sure you have time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It takes four hours to completely break the egg. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this time, no one disagrees, so everyone, using all the abilities, can begin the journey of breaking the egg. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inside of the egg. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The students of the four major colleges are very honestly hiding in a safe outer city under the leadership of the teacher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teachers are very clear that they have a few pounds and two, and with this group of students to participate in the Holy Grail competition is to find death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time they are quietly waiting for the external rescue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All students’ eyes are staring at the huge Holy Grail at this time, and the vision has grown by four points, but their eyes are still reluctant to leave that huge glory. shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because this is the Holy Grail! It is a great existence that is comparable to the gods in the legend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the palace, with the rise of the Holy Grail, when the people returned from the shock, they found that the giant emperor had disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time they are covered in the shape of the Holy Grail, only feeling that the soul of the whole person is shaking violently, and there is even the danger of flying out at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Get out of here!" said Ryan, and the Holy Father, with the rest of the people turned and ran, quickly leaving the cover of the Holy Grail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Grail is really big, its illusion is at least a huge area of ​​500 meters square on the ground, and the height of the shadow is at least 600 meters. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the appearance of the virtual shadow, the house of the entire palace can be seen, and the ground quickly disintegrates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then like the movement of the earth's crust, the ground is constantly fragmented, and it seems that something terrible is rising from the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rumble...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of a horrible earthquake is constantly coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The laborers who escaped clearly felt that the entire imperial city was rapidly breaking down and falling down. It seems that there is a horrible cliff below the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咔咔咔...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the earth's crust is falling off, something is constantly rising. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gradually, people found that it was a huge mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This mountain seems to be a huge, faucet that rises from the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The palace of the palace is now at the top of the dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This mountain is very huge, and with the constant rise, it even broke through the entire imperial city and spread towards the inner city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are people who have stepped back to avoid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After an hour or so, the mountain peak appeared completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a huge mountain with a strange shape. It looks at least three hundred meters high. After rising from the ground, it looks like six huge faucets. Spliced ​​together, there are more than a dozen high and low peaks on the top, the cliffs are very steep, and you can see the stone bumps like a blade, the shape is extremely strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time people can see some caves and passages on it, it seems that there is a very complicated labyrinth in the middle, leading to somewhere inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My God! What the hell is this place??" Everyone saw this, full of shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the great peaks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug and Randall are slowly moving forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two people feel that they have been moving down to a height of about one hundred meters and passed a dozen forks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two hours ago, two people entered the underground underground palace of the palace through the huge sewer of the palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why he came in from the sewer was not because Su Gehui knew the truth, but that he found the mark that the wolf blood soldier Andrew had left for himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrew seems to have guessed that Su Ge will definitely enter the Imperial City to find some key things, so he left a mark on Suge while walking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the two people of Su Ge have followed the mark for an hour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not how far the journey is, but the violent vibration of the entire underground palace makes the road ahead very difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two men stopped and stopped, for fear of any problems and could not find a way back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One layer after another, gradually, Su Ge ears fretting, heard a burst of harsh metal strikes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s coming soon!" Su Ge said, taking Randall to speed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through three crossings, it took about five minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a huge roar, a figure flew straight over and squatted at Su Ge’s feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the person who is being sent out, it is Andrew. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time Andrew's state is very bad, the whole body is blood, his eyes are dim, his arms are full of scary wounds, at least a dozen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyes are also smashed, and the left thumb is also cut off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The armor has been smashed by the horrible attack, like a piece of worn iron on his body, ready to fall off at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey! Are you okay!?" Su Ge saw Andrew at this moment, suddenly looked shocked and said, bending over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Small...heart!" Andrew said with a gasp,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, A series of flying knives suddenly flew over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Randall instantly turned into a black air and blocked all the flying knives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg looked up and found a man in a silver-gray armor in the distance, with a giant sword in his hand, standing there, the flying knife was his Shot out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Holy Sword!!" Su Ge saw this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because this man’s costumes and weapons are exactly the same as the Holy Swords of the Church of the Holy Blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, this person did not seem to have come over, slowly retreating back, seemingly guarding something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge lifted Andrew up and took out a bloody remedy for him to fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a bloody treatment that showed that the wound on his body began to heal quickly, but the broken fingers and the smashed eyes could not be recovered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Andrew resumed, Sug turned his head and looked at the front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very wide underground space, surrounded by weird rocks, and there are many puddles on the ground that seem very humid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, three people are on the side of this thing space. From here, most of them can see the wall, and other scenes see very little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Randall immediately sent a few small bats out to explore the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can fly out less than ten seconds, and with a shrill scream, die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge said: "Don’t worry, wait until he recovers and ask about the situation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Randall nodded slightly and waited quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half an hour, Andrew recovered almost, and took a breath and looked at Su Gedao: "Thank you, I have even thought about my last words." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled and said: "This last word is still used later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Andrew grinned and looked at the front and said: "This is a huge space. I can feel the skull is below the space. But this space has some very powerful enemies, I can't cope."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened to those Saints?" Su Ge asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andr swayed his head: "I don't know, not only the Holy Sword, but also a horrible monster full of black long hair. He is huge. There is also a robotic arm that is mutated. Others are fine. This guy, I have nothing to do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Su Ge’s face was full of weirdness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong?" Andrew asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge said: "His name is Sapir, the bishop of the Nighthawk Church. Before he entered the city of Byron, he was polluted. When we evacuated, we will He used to cover the way we retreat to leave him in the city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, Andrew was not surprised, calmly said: "This is very March. The style of the church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Except Sapir, are the other people in the church?" Su Ge asked. Andrew shook his head. "There are some other people, but the clothes that those people wear are very old and I don't know. These people are very strong." That Andrew is a master, there are several clergymen who are expert, and a few weird and old guys are also masters. They guard this space and it is very difficult."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge listened to his eyes and released the aftermath of the late bell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a general understanding of the situation up and down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is still a huge space below. I probed 70 meters. Nothing was detected. No bottom was detected. There are some passages on the right. There are five enemies in the 70-meter range on the left, two of which are members of the two holy swords, and the other three are the combination of the gods and the combat nuns, all of whom are experts."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about the other?" Andrew asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug shook his head: "The space seems to be very large and can't be felt here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "What are the means of their attack? I just watched the people of the Holy Sword team use darts. Normally these people would not use them." Randall and the Holy Swords played some dealings and even fought, so Have some understanding of their fighting habits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrew explained: "They are a bit strange. They seem to have their own consciousness, but they are not under their control. They can not only use all the previous knowledge, but even the whole. Knowledge has been strengthened, and some have come into contact with new knowledge and means, which is very difficult."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
