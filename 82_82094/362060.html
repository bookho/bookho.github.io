			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not know how many times you have recited, Su Ge feels that his entire soul form has undergone tremendous changes, and seems to have completely changed into another brand new form. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he opened his eyes and found himself wearing a black robe on his bare body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The robes are large, some are broken, no buttons, no zippers, and the ankles are extended from the upper body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a huge hood on the shoulder that can’t be seen in the dark shadows. I can only see a pair of burning cloaks under the hood. The eyes of the blue flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both hands extended out of the robes, extending two black sleeves, and the low voice came out from under the hood: "Pray for it, I know." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The lost soul, the beast of revenge, listen to the prelude to the soul of the town, release the soul in the evening bell, and get redemption."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! Boom! Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thick, solemn bells spread in this desolate grave, echoing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the bell, there is a whisper similar to prayer, fuzzy to hear some of the names of gods and words with mysterious power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen to the bell, these ghosts are in the air, slowly raising their heads, their white eyes and their long mouth gradually infiltrating into the blue The radiance of the color, the bursts of joy, the happy atmosphere accompanied by the blue light, gradually appeared in the cemetery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咔咔咔...numerable sounds like cracked shackles sounded in the graveyard, and the bodies of these ghosts were radiated by the sound waves of the late bell. Colored cracks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, in the broken into a lot of blue spirits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The spirit of salvation is not gold, but blue? Is it because of the evolution of my kingdom? Or because of the particularity of this night's power? After all, In the whisper, the night-time prisoners are the soul's stalkers, and the home of these souls is the Hades mentioned, not my god country."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Su Ge looked at these souls and thought about it, but did not spend too much time, open his arms and said: "The soul wandering in the world, return to my arms."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp These spirits have no consciousness, leaving only the instinctive power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing the voice of Su Ge, this total of 1,200 blue souls became the light of the massive blue ghost, along the Su Ge The two blacks under the arms, the wide cuffs flew in and disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evening cravings these souls, and now, the spiritual night clock has merged with Su Ge’s will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sozo, even the evening clock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These souls are not here, but enter the rest of the place through the late bell. It seems that this night is indeed connected somewhere. But it is not without The benefits, these souls count as the evolution of the gods, the residual power of thought has a very good nourishment for my soul."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; can be seen, with With the disappearance of the soul, the holes and gaps in Sugna's worn robes have been filled and become a perfect robes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪嗒! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, the entire space suddenly shattered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The robes on Su Ge disappeared, black suits, canes, skulls, etc. reappeared in his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The illusion is lifted and returned to reality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What have you done! What have you done?!!!" At this moment, Oliver was pale and incomparably angry with Suger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can see it, his anger and anger at this moment is like the sudden accumulation of money for a lifetime. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s face was innocent: “I didn’t do anything! I just looked at those ghosts, so I was very kind and generous.” The gospel of their salvation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh! You may not know it yet!" Su Ge seemed to think, suddenly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corner of his mouth is slightly tilted, with a smile of apologetic elegance: "My mysterious profession is a priest, and purifying the devil is the best thing." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oliver heard the face of this moment is green, both eyes Staring at Su Ge for a long time can't speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;噗嗤! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the mouth suddenly spit out a large mouthful of blood, and the whole person suddenly became seven or eight years old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The illusion is just his biggest killer, although it is illusion, but those souls are all genuine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spiritual space between illusory and reality, built on the book of the Undead, has made him win in battles that have survived and died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now...the thousands of ghosts that he has accumulated over the past ten years have been purified by this damn priest! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I... I killed you!" In the incomparable anger, Oliver lost his mind and was about to go away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher, the Lord's plan!" Seeing Oliver like this, the two believers behind him hurriedly reminded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear the Lord of the Moon, the angry Fury Oliver immediately calmed down, he knew his hobby and temperament, forcibly suppressed the anger in his heart, wiped it The blood of the corner of the mouth, once again opened the book of the undead, and tried to say calmly in a calm tone: "I don't have time to waste with you now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He crossed Sugs and looked back to Vanas: "Your Majesty, if you want your subjects to be safe, you should take the initiative to go with us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "You dream! You damn demon!" Jean screamed with anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Olifo directly ignores the toy that is out of his control, staring at Vanas and asking: "You really thought that we would turn them into werewolves, then Is there any control at all?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon hearing this, Vanas whispered, "What do you mean?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oliver sneered: "It will be more troublesome to explain, just give You can demonstrate it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, the believer behind him took out a dark stick from his arms. With the injection of psionic energy, the top of the stick The gem shines a glimpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he lifted the stick and looked at the body of Prince Sacco who became a werewolf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, this glare seems to have caused a terrible reaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah! Don't! Don't! I don't want to die!" The corpse of the Sergeant Sakko's strong werewolf quickly collapsed and collapsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty seconds into a pool of thick water and pale bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is!!" Seeing all the nobles was stupid, and the dark eyes were full of horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this, what Jean seems to think of, his face pale and whispered: "Sister, they do have the means to let the werewolf collapse, not only There are also large-scale methods. There are not many people who hold this method and props, but this guy absolutely has!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas listens At this point, my face suddenly sinks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Soviet Union standing in the middle saw that there was not much panic and his attitude was still calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next second, an invisible blade appeared instantly, cut on the young man's wrist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oliver had long been inductive, and was smashed at the moment when the sharp blade just touched the young wrist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the remaining three other believers took out the same stick at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your Majesty, if you don't want these important ministers and nobles to die, then advise people who don't rush to do it." Oliver said coldly. Raise his hand and a wolf head formed by a gray air mass in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just need to crush this, the remaining fifty-six werewolves will die, and one will not live."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You better consider clearly if This group of aristocrats died, and the entire Guinness country will collapse directly. Even if it is barely controlled by centralization, the national strength of the entire country will be at least 50 years back!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Vanas looked gloomy and fell into meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oliver said that these nobles have mastered 50% of the wealth and resources of the entire country, and 60% of the land is the division of these people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once these people die, Vanas will not only face no one available, but these aristocratic fiefs will be completely chaotic and enter the state of division. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, it was not only difficult but also a huge price to reunify. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug saw this seem a little bit afraid, the body slightly backed up two steps and said loudly: "You calm down!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty! Your Majesty! Save us! We don't want to die!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty! Save us! We are willing to give everything! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes! Land, property, are you not going to land reform? We are willing to take it out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Right right! We are willing!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One time All the nobles flustered into a group and mourned for help. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are even two werewolves who stretch out their paws and prepare to take Vanas directly and ask for merit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, accompanied by a piercing fracture, the two werewolves’ heads were twisted and fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who dares to start thinking, I don't mind killing you all before they start, back!" Vegginia's cold-hearted warning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, these nobles stepped back two steps, kneeling on the ground and praying for Vanas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What should I do? Sister?" Jean was also panicked at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas looked up and looked at the returned Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge smiled at her and said in a mouthful: "According to your thoughts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Vanas saw that the heart suddenly had a bottom, took a deep breath, looked around the aristocrats who were afraid of death, and said faintly: "The real emperor will never give up her people." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sister! You!" Jean seemed to think of something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas smiled at the younger brother who had just met and said: "Do not worry, my Lord will bless me safely."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surrounding aristocrats saw this completely stupid. They never imagined that this Queen will really pay for their lives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty! You..." At this moment, these greedy aristocrats are filled with gratitude and reverence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas took a step out of the crowd and said faintly: "The latter thing is the sole responsibility of Mr. Sotos."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These nobles want to say something, but they don’t know what to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, their messy voice, certain families and families in the days to give absolute loyalty to the royal family, and absolute obedience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The great Queen, we will always remember you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, Vanas whispered to Su Ge: "The Pope will continue to trouble you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugwen and a smile: "Do not worry, to In the name of the Lord, I will definitely make you safe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
