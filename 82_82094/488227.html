			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At 10 am, Suger’s team rushed to the foothills of the Misty Mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at it, a curved path twists and turns in the mountains on both sides, and the green mountains on both sides of the dragon are on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slopes are relatively steep, covered with dark green coniferous plants, and the peaks on both sides are high and low. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Low is like a raised mountain bag, high straight into the sky, into the clouds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, at the foot of the mountain, it is already possible to see some sporadic bodies still being there, violent wilderness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people are very miserable, some people are festering, some are dismembered, and some have no brains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why are you so anxious to find death?" Su Ge took his notebook and sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not easy to meet a master who is related to his own knowledge. This few hours of listening to Su Ge is to see the clouds and see the day. Sonic said that he quickly wrote down the points here and unknowingly wrote more than twenty pages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sound waves look out the window: "Are you sighing, or ironic?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" There are."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic touched his injured leg: "I heard that the church has formed a coalition in March, and you put this witch in such a bright and beautiful way. In your own carriage, are you afraid of being discovered?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge casually said: "You don't say, who knows?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the sound wave is replaced by the dress of the nuns of the Holy Blood Church, which is the spare dress of Hills. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who can think of a witch wearing a church dress and sitting next to the church bishop as long as he does not take it casually? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Glorious Alliance knows that I am very aware of the injuries."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then I will find a chance to kill them. Anyway, I don't see them well." Su Ge said casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sound wave looked at Su Ge deeply: "Are you sure that you are not a cult leader, but a legendary bishop of the March church?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge smiled a little: "Of course I am not a cult leader!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he said, he is not really a cult now. Head, he has stepped down! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound wave looked at Su Ge deeply, and did not go deeper, the palm of his hand held the chin and looked out the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They just know that you are hurt, no one knows what you are, right?" Su Ge confirmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic nodded: "Well, this can be guaranteed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is peace of mind Sitting in the carriage, I will keep you safe." Su Ge looks confident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage went down the mountain along the road in the middle of the mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the deepening of the road, the number of horses and people on both sides gradually increased. Most of these people are organized, and they have already set up tents in twos and threes. A small camp was formed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;watching each other, although very vigilant, but did not rush to shoot, it seems that there are people who maintain discipline. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Su Ge’s carriage came here, everyone’s eyes fell on the red-colored Church of the Holy Blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s finally coming!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three churches seem to be equal in strength and balanced. But everyone knows that the leader of the three churches is the Church of the Holy Blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Others don’t say that just one blood therapy has firmly grasped the lives of countless countries and organizations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound waves through the window looked at the two sides with awe, and the mysterious people who took the initiative to let the road open, slightly sighed: "The Church of the Holy Blood, it is really convenient."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Su Ge deeply agreed to nod: "Convenience is convenient, but there are many restrictions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All things have a price, mutual conservation is always the same The truth." Sound waves tell one of the famous quotes of the mysterious world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the conversation, after the team passed three turns, the narrow mountain road suddenly became cheerful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very spacious river valley, the ground is flat and dry, on both sides of the river bed where things flow, it is now dry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The front is a relatively gentle hillside. This hillside is the road that once led to the ancient city of Aya. It is the only way to go to the ancient city of Agua. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other side is a steep cliff, this place is a treasure trove of camping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge sees it out, others naturally know it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are hundreds of people in the wide valley now busy, and there are almost a dozen camps around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more than a dozen small tents that have been built in the middle, surrounded by black and gray curtains, forming a temporary wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a pair of women's hands holding the water on the gray curtain, which cures the church's logo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black curtain is a black-eyed eagle standing on a branch, representing the Nighthawk Church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lot of guards in the black robes and the heavily armed hunters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking out, the two churches have been united overnight to form a large camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides this large camp, there are some other camps on the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the scale is relatively small, and the campsite is a fortress that is dominated by brown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The camp of the Glorious Church with pure white as the main color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are camps for elves that are green in color, and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After removing these camps, there are some small and medium-sized organizations, or institutions that have already completed their stationing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The busy people around the same time stopped their work at the same time, watching the four dark horse carriages coming in slowly, whispering between each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the large camp, two men and one woman came out at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man is about forty years old, looks normal, temperament is smooth and round, although wearing a dark and close-fitting short robe, it is very good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another woman is wearing a white robes, her hair combed neatly, her bright face with a faint delight, and it is the deputy bishop of the Church, Jenny. Soro. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey? Actually promoted?" Su Ge had some surprises. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;June now has a special golden embroidered edge on the side of her clothes, and her coat of arms has a cloud-like corner, which is a cure for the church bishop. symbols of! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four carriages came to the door of this huge camp naturally, and the two guards at the door opened the door and let the carriage come in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some frictions between the churches in March, but like three independent brothers, they are related to money, but they involve themselves. If you have problems with family faces and scenes, then you have to work together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two churches came early, and they had given the Holy Blood Church a very spacious place when the camp was established. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the leadership of Alger, the four carriages first rushed to the open space, and Su Ge took Lobo out of the carriage and watched the two laugh and salute: " The Church of the Holy Blood, the Bishop of Guinness, Suger Sotos, has seen two compatriots, and the glory of the goddess will always shine on you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, the people around me suddenly felt amazed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary bishop’s reputation is outside, and there is a lot of controversy, and the topic is very high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't expect to actually send him, is there a real thing, I will see it soon." The mysterious people around me thought, gradually dispersed open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, it’s just a topical character, not a peerless beauty. Just look at what you know and you don’t have to stare at it all the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man brought an approachable smile and went forward: "The deputy bishop of the Nighthawk Church, Childe Sidrick, met Bishop Sotos. May the goddess be with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jenny also followed, with a very bright smile on her lips, saying: "Cure the church bishop, Jenny Solo has seen Bishop Sotos, and the grace of the goddess will keep you healthy forever."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three men walked into the campside side by side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bishop, Bishop Horace Banson and Bishop Sapir-Andre are waiting for you." Bishop Childe said with a smile Su Ge was taken to the middle of the camp, the largest rectangular tent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three people walked in, can see the area inside is very large, there is a long conference table in the middle, the mountain sand table has been prepared, there are no Less chairs and hangers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the side of the sand table, two people are standing at the discussion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The left is a middle-aged man in his forties, his body is overweight, wearing a robes like Jenny, some abnormal white skin, baldness, face A slightly longer, sparse eyebrow with a somewhat gloomy triangle makes people look uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside him is a young man in his thirties, tall, bald, wearing a dark robes, eyebrows, slightly smaller eyes, eagle hooks Nasal, thick lips, at this time with his hands behind his back, giving a feeling of being tall and arrogant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, there is no good thing." Su Ge has already made a qualitative decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
