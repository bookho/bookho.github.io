			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tes is powerless on the ground, his hands support the body, the strong body constantly trembles, the eyes without the focal length look at the ground without a god, like a The same as dementia patients. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it has been, he has struggled to recover his unbroken spirit and the intractable recovery of the godless eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What the sound of the bell is, it’s horrible!" It was his first reaction to the moment of returning to God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reaction, then he suddenly looked up and found that the elegant and horrible clock-bearer was walking towards himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, the person was expressionless, and his eyes were filled with a kind of high indifference and contempt, as if a tall giant looked at a dirty bug. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He clearly felt at the moment that this person had a terrible gas field and pressure, and each time he stepped forward, his heart trembled, then An invisible pressure is on his mind, making him mentally slow and even breathing hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't! Please don't kill us! We are also ordered to act!" The distance is getting closer and closer, the huge fear oppresses the spirit of Tes, blocked Thinking makes him not have much room for thinking, and he can only ask for mercy in his instinct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You? You seem to be finished." The voice of indifference came from the top of his head, and Tes's nose suddenly smelled a strong bloody smell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very rich taste, and it seems to carry an unspeakable warmth, coming from both sides of his body, pervading the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tes seems to think of something, twisting the stiff neck to the left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a bloody land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And above this blood red, various dismembered bodies are stacked on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have their heads split in half, some bodies are cut into four sections, some are cut off from the middle, and some are smashed from the middle. Open...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people are now like the firewood that had just been opened by the widowers. Their wounds were incomparably clean, without a bit of bone fragments, and without a trace of broken meat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the kind of blade is dedicated to cutting the human body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood flow will make the khaki land bright, and the broken bodies will pile up there without feeling any horror and blood, but will give people a clean and neat . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s as clean and neat as a person who has just packed up his messy house and placed everything neatly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Boss...Save...I..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Tess is sluggish, hard and painful The sound came from his right side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He heard the voice turn like a robot and turned his head to see the young man who was physically disabled, just the young man who shot and attacked Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had a good luck, his body was cut from the abdomen and split into two halves, and he did not die instantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man squatted on the floor, his hands clutching the bloody red soil, and his mouth vomited and looked at Tes, crawling hard and said: "Save me... I don't want to... die ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just finished, the young man was unable to lie in a pool of blood, motionless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! Hahaha! Ah! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know if it’s a scream, or the sound of laughter comes from Tes’s mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Tess’ eyes are wide, his eyes are full of bloodshot eyes, his mouth is stunned, his expression is distorted and a burst of screaming madness is like crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rear, Irene at the top of the cargo is now completely stupid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this really the height that mysterious people can achieve?" At this moment, Elena's mouth is wide and she can even stuff an egg. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pupil of the eye has narrowed to the limit, and the situation in front of it is not as good as God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point all the thoughts in her mind are completely filled with the picture just now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The picture from the beginning to the end, but the two-second picture is infinitely circulating in her mind, and I can’t forget it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that moment, she didn’t even see what it was, and she saw that the bodies of those people around Tes were instantly dismembered by invisible forces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that moment, it’s like these people are not people at all, but the building blocks dolls glued together by a mysterious force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Su Ge is the master of this mysterious power. When he undoes this power, these dolls fall apart instantly and become non-adult Components. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the most shocking scene I have ever seen in my life." Elena muttered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cleanliness of the cut, the speed of which makes Elena unable to understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She clearly saw that even when the people were dismembered, even the flesh did not react, and the limbs and the limbs suddenly separated, nothing. Adhesive bloodshot, bone marrow, no splashing blood and internal organs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that moment, what people see is not the horror and blood of dismemberment, but the purity and sacredness of a purely artistic level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this scene, Irina has a feeling of spiritual sublimation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, Su Ge spit out a breath to adjust his breathing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The just-in-one operation, all his psionics were all emptied, and will be pushed to the limit in his latest understanding of the night clock, with his own time The perfect blow from the strange mental form. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The form is really wonderful." Su Ge’s heart was hard to remember. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
