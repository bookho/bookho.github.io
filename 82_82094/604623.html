			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard this voice, Malkiton widened his eyes and turned his head. His face was incredible: "Impossible! How can you come out from there!" ?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Near the gate of the gate, Su Ge and Sherry stood calmly and looked at Marchi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug said with a sigh of relief: "Don't say that, in order to get out of that ghost place, I wasted a lot of time."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a weird smile on the side of Shirley's mouth: "You can't see it, you are actually a mouse that is good at big holes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Su Ge spread the hand: "I have seen a person, holding a small palm-sized hammer, and used it for 20 years to escape from prison. I am just imitating him."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How did you come out!? Who put you out?" Marchi asked at the gloomy face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge turned to look at her and said, "This is a very difficult story. Now it’s a long night. Since everyone has time, I will talk to you. I have just had a valuable jailbreak experience."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time returned to half an hour ago, Su Ge had just been detained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn, this room I have seen, is the place where the church dedicated to escorting dangerous mystery in March. The entire wall is made of special metal from the March church. Made of fire-resistant, cold-resistant, and extremely hard, it also isolates all the psionic fluctuations and mysterious penetration."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert said, waved, A burst of bright light appeared from his palm. If you look closely, Su Ge found that it was a light bulb that was not too big. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the light bulb, Albert walked on the silver-gray wall and touched it and analyzed: "The whole wall is at least half a meter thick. Hardness and thickness, even the master warriors can't break. This is beyond the limits of the human body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is not too concerned about his words, he His eyes were placed on the small light bulb in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your knowledge is current?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert nodded slightly: "Well, the main research direction is the current response and other aspects in the organism, the ability to combat is not too strong, need to be near It’s effective, and there’s nothing too good defense.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When looking at the light bulb in Albert’s hand, Sug patted his shoulder, serious Said: "I have a feeling."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What does it feel?" asked Albert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge said: "You have the opportunity to become a great sage who opens up a new body of knowledge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;When I heard this, Albert suddenly stunned and then smiled bitterly: "At this time, you should not make me jokes. We should think about how to go out. If the time is late, those cultists may be pulled up. Everyone on board was buried."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The side of Mary heard this face pale, but still relatively calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is not stupid, she has already felt faintly at this time, it is not ordinary people to save his own Mr. Assassin twice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is Mr. Assassin the legendary mystery?" Mary screamed in her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a simple expression of Su Ge: "Reassured, this thing is still hard to beat me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br /> ;&nbsp;After hearing this, Albert looked a little embarrassed, but did not dare to refute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here are four people, she said two worms, which two, it goes without saying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looked around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rooms are all made of the same metal and look like one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room is small, about three meters wide, about five meters long and two meters five high, like a metal cage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The craftsmanship in this room is really good, there are two doors on the left and right sides, but after they are all closed, the inside actually sees any traces." Su Ge exclaimed Said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert said: "This is the celestial technique that healed the church. It was originally used to reconnect bones, and limbs were transplanted without leaving scars and Oh, it looks like a whole, and later it was applied to construction and forging for some reason."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tianyi plan? Is it seamless?" Su Ge Come to interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert asked: "If you can go out, then as soon as possible, the entire space is sealed, in the case of four of us, about half an hour, The oxygen in the entire room was consumed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded slightly, took off the blindfold and coat and handed it to Shelley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take up the sleeves to reveal a strong arm, and the cane in his hand transforms into a long sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing? This hard and smooth wall is absolutely impossible to open with a sword. And the wall is absolutely isolated and mysterious, your vibration knowledge There is no effect on the wall," Albert hurriedly reminded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge held a long sword in front of the wall and said: "As long as the sword is sharp enough, the strength is big enough, there is nothing in the world to open." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Su Ge put the sword tip of the sword against the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aside from the moment, Albert and Mary looked at Su Ge with their eyes wide open, hoping to see some miracles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of such a smooth and sturdy wall, piercing with a sword is simply a fantasy for two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here Su Ge’s fingers waved twice and applied an intensive technique to his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, both hands clenched the hilt and took a deep breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗡嗡嗡嗡......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, a squeak of vibrating sound and cutting sounds screamed with the glare of Mars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh my God!" Seeing this scene, Albert was full of horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Mary is completely stupid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, you can see that there are a lot of subtle and illusory phantoms around Suge's blade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the result of the high-speed vibration of the entire blade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take all your vibrations to drive the long sword at a very high frequency, and the effect can reach the impact of the drill bit and the cutting machine General cutting force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since the wall is completely immune to mystery, then use physical methods to destroy him!" Su Ge looks with a cozy smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not apply his knowledge to the wall, but to his own sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zizizi...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of steel cutting is constantly coming out, the scattered Mars is like the sky The fireworks in the darkness are dazzling in this dark space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After about a minute, the vibration stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a bang, Su Ge pulled out the long sword and made a sound like a long sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, Albert’s vision was drawn by the gap of about three fingers wide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because a burst of bright light shines through the cracks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the light coming in, there is fresh air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This... How is this possible? This is something that the mysterious lord can't do!" Albert murmured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
