			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While Su Ge began to run, Sam, who had been away from the game, suddenly stopped returning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After taking the potion, he is only physically and spiritually enhanced, and the overall combat quality is still low. This guy should be an organization just ran out. Experienced novice, no fighting experience. His body function will gradually weaken after taking the potion itself. If so..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sam thinks this is exciting Because at this moment he found the excitement of chasing prey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stalker, the meaning of the name is hunt and hunt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he simply checked his equipment, drank a bottle and a mysterious potion that slowly restored the psionic power, then turned to chase Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Due to the doubling of physical fitness, Su Ge is running very fast now, far beyond normal people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The direction he is going to now is not the palace, but the carriage waiting for him in Central. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is unrealistic to run back to the palace. The time for the potion to fade is still half an hour, and the effect of the drug subsides until the toxicity completely breaks out for about twenty minutes. It takes about ten minutes to find the carriage. The carriage is going all the way to the Imperial City. It takes about 30 minutes to get it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg’s calm analysis at this time Road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps the basis for taking a potion once, Su Ge did not feel severe pain at the moment, and too much fear and worry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Run all the way back to the city, raise your hand to launch the claws, fly the house lightly, jump all the way, like a parkour, rush to the carriage in the shortest straight distance s position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But when he just skipped two houses, he suddenly shot a cold arrow behind his back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s body is no longer the same, slightly hiding from the arrow, the ice blue cockroach suddenly turned and looked at it, just to see the distance About forty meters away, the stalker Sam squatted on a chimney. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking a deep breath, Su Ge did not care for him and continued to move forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, on the way to the next, that Sam was hanging far behind Su Ge, constantly releasing cold arrows to interfere with Su Ge, this arrow is so far The distance shot was not a big threat to Su Ge, but it greatly interfered with the speed of his progress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Stalker, really treat me as your prey!?" Under the moonlight, Su Ge's face was full of embarrassment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sam in the distance calmly said to himself: "When the wolf is hunting for prey, it is not fierceness and strength, but endurance and patience. I have enough time to play with you, do you have it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I ran so fast, he could still find me, what should I have on my body? He was moved by his hands and feet." Su Ge swept his eyes and sniffed his nose carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smell that can't be smelled on weekdays is smelled by the fortified nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a cane!” Sug focused on the cane, then thought of the impact of the cane and the chopper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gloves are substances outside the field, they are not attached to the world's conventional substances, and should have no smell."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think of this, the fortified night clock is instantly magnified, covering the area for a time, the radius reaches a limit distance of 50 meters, covering the rear of the Sam. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body suddenly rushed forward, Su Ge fired the claws from the house, and then turned back and forth, jumping in from a dilapidated window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because now in the outer city, most of the houses have been abandoned, and the cane is placed in the corner of the house. Su Ge’s left hand pops up the sleeve sword and the right hand takes out the frost. skull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After feeling the position of Sam and the surrounding buildings, the brain quickly analyzed and found a dead corner of his sight, and the body quietly left the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Sam stopped suddenly because he found Su Ge hiding in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Want to hide here and ambush me? That place is really the corner of my sight, but my nose is not vegetarian." Sam said, a flash of light on his nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He actually engraved the runes on his nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He will not wait too long due to the problem of the potion. The strange effective distance of the blade should not exceed 40 meters, here is absolutely A safe location, just waiting for peace of mind." Sam is winning the prize at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he waited, he suddenly heard a subtle voice in his ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Su Ge used his claws to jump up from the wall behind him at a speed of incomparable speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What!?" Seeing this, Sam suddenly was shocked, and Su Ge had already rushed up like a wolf at the moment, and the sleeve sword in his hand was directly stabbed. To his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strengthen the physical speed of twice as fast, so that Sam can't fully react. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;噗嗤! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the difficult dodge, Su Ge’s sleeve sword pierced his right rib. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sam reluctantly slammed and then retired, then pinched a red sphere and threw it at Sug. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A moment, a large number of flames appeared out of thin air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug has just heard of his explosion trap, releasing psionic power, and the ice blue flame on the skull burst out instantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The towering flame has an indescribable cold, and all the flames of the explosion trap are extinguished in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Secret!?" Seeing this, Sam's eyes widened and his face was astonished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horror was horrified, his hand was not idle, his body leaped again and again, and then he retired and opened the distance with Socrata, and once again took out the arrow and pointed at the Soviet Union. Shooting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three hair arrows are perfectly blocked by the night bell. The flames receded, and Su Ge did not know when he had pulled out a slender silver revolver. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Gun!?" At this moment Sam is still jumping in the air, there is no place to borrow, can not dodge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This gun is a bit weird, can't resist!" Sam took out the last psionic shield and pinched it directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰的............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next second, under Sam’s frightened gaze, his own The psionic shield is as fragile as paper, and it is broken and broken by the bullet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a sudden pain came from the forehead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am dying!?" This is Sam’s last thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪叽! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sam’s head hit by a bullet was wide-eyed, and then burst like a balloon filled with more air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brain, the brain, and the scattered eyes are everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the powerful effect of the Moon Fran, the bullet is extremely penetrating for mystery, and the bullet will burst directly after encountering severe obstacles. Can be called the nemesis of all mysteries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you don't die, you won't die, you will need life as a price." Su Ge said indifferently, regardless of his body, he turned back and took it. With a cane, quickly ran towards the middle ring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After six minutes, in the middle of the ring waiting for Su Ge’s groom to see the scary black blood vessels on Su Ge’s face, he was shocked: “Mr., you This is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I use the potion, go quickly, and return to the Imperial City at the fastest speed!" Su Ge said immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The groom listened to his face solemnly, turned his head and picked up the reins and shouted: "Drive!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;</div>
