			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tulip apartment is generally a middle class with very good income. Most of them are teachers, accountants, engineers, lawyers and other professions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today these well-dressed gentlemen and ladies are not in a hurry to return to their homes to prepare dinner after dinner, or to invite a beautiful lady to make a romantic date . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their eyes are on the police line, and most people’s attention falls on the man who has an old face but is full of men. Sexy hunter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I heard that the demon hunters have no feelings, but they have desires. Their bodies age very slowly and are stronger than normal people!" White fox fur shawl, with a silk hat, dressed in a gray silk dress, the young lady looked at Jerous with some ecstasy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This mature and vicissitudes of middle-aged men are very attractive to their young women who are single-handed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looked at the distant eyes of the well-dressed women who looked like a wolf, turned their heads and looked at the look of seriousness. "It has to be said that the master of Gerlos is indeed full of the charm of men."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your choice is very wise, Su Ge." At this time, Gerlos put down Said the pipe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge returned to God and collected the miscellaneous thoughts in his heart and listened carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The array here, together with the psionic and mysterious objects here, form a sophisticated psionic bomb. If you rush in, it will directly trigger the detonation. The effect is huge, it is estimated that the half of the condominiums can be completely flattened."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嘶! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The presence of Orson, Su Ge, Jack, Roland and others heard this while sucking in a cold air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ossen hurriedly asked: "Master, do you need to evacuate the crowd first?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jie Los nodded and said: "In case, just need to evacuate. I am not very good at this thing. If it is completely lifted, it is estimated that other people need assistance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon hearing this, Orson led all the police to start evacuating the crowds around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the residents were very dissatisfied after hearing it, but their lives were critical, they said that they were unwilling, and they still took the core property back to safety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Jerouss sat down and took out a few blank papers and charcoal pencils from his suitcase and began to draw and analyze it carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is completely dark over time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold wind blew through, accompanied by snowflakes falling from the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who were dissipated were far from their homes, but they were properly arranged to the hotel and they were eating dinner, grilling the stove and waiting for the results, very comfortable and Cozy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge quietly stood next to Gerlos and waited quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;叮铃铃......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A small, crisp bell sounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss stood up and shook his white paper that had been painted by him and said, "It’s finally coming."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge heard the sound here, just to see the night watchman Rogan, Marx, Bobby three people like the three ghosts quietly emerge from the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嘎嘎嘎! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sky, I don’t know when a red-eyed crow appeared and called two flies back into Rogan’s big robe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there something that we can't do with the master of Gerlos?" Rogan came over and smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relationship between the two seems to be good, and Jerous’s hard-to-find mouth is slightly provoked, barely showing a smile and showing his welcome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know mine, Rogan. I don't know anything about the psionic flow and the fork-and-pin theory." Gerlos said straightforwardly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master Gerlos!" Two young patrolmen say hello. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss nodded, revealing Su Ge sideways: "You introduce, this..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "We have seen each other in the morning, and each has a very good first impression." Rogan said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss didn't ask much, pointing to the inside and said: "The sketch is finished, look at it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogen came over and looked at the drawing, and raised the lantern to illuminate the dark room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is actually the technique in the book of the Necromancer." Rogan looked at it and said unexpectedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss voice is always a tone, calmly said: "That is, the intelligence is correct. The dead souls of the three mysterious books lost in the church that year." The book really fell into the hands of the Church of Death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It should be true, but they seem to have not been thoroughly researched, and the whole surgery has this flaw." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogen said, whispered two sentences, and a thick spirit could appear to cover his lantern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a warm, bright lantern that turned into a cold blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The glass cover of the lantern is turned on, and the blue flame flies out like an elf! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My God!" Seeing this scene, Sug's eyes widened and his face was amazed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first time he has seen such an extraordinary ability after coming to the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This group is like a fairy flame slowly wandering around the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And here, Su Ge used this kind of flame to see dozens of invisible purple threads appearing in the empty room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These wires are connected to each other with different things, just like the lead of a mine, it is extremely dangerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at a thread less than a metre from the door, Su Ge recalled that the thread was less than ten centimeters from Jack's chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a sense of happiness in the ghost gate closed a circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After wandering around the Flame Elf, he returned to Rogan’s lantern again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogan hangs the lantern on his waist and pulls out a sterling silver dagger from under the robes and says, "You use your interference to ensure that these psionics are not I will have toot out all the key nodes, and I will quickly fix it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerousus listened to the silver-white dagger behind him, two Like the gymnasts, the masters easily walked around the silk lines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They should be okay?" Su Ge is now a rookie of non-combat, and he doesn't know anything about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warren nodded and said, "Don't worry, the teacher and Uncle Rogan shot at the same time, without any problems."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge listened to a sigh of relief, standing here quietly waiting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At 10:30 in the evening, after two and a half hours of precision investigation, the two masters removed the bomb and placed two core mysterious objects inside. Take it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pair of dark goat horns, a jar filled with brains that don’t know what it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two masters attached great importance to these two materials and turned them into their own boxes without explanation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogan said here: "Sug, we found the soul of the deceased inside. It was fixed here as a lead for launching a bomb. It is now safe. Go, let's go over her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge listened and nodded, took out the "Month of the Moon" in his arms and walked in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't forget to ask about the murderer," added Geros. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
