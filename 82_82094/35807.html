			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack smiled at the cup: "You are now a detective. We just received a notice from the Deputy Secretary, saying that the murderer has been found by you, officially handed over. I have dealt with the church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge heard the bitter smile: "What kind of detective? It’s just some of the abilities that are risky. There is no technicality."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But this efficiency is really high, and colleagues around you are very fond of you," Jack said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug said with a smile: "As long as you don't treat me as a monster, I am afraid of it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speaking of this, the topic has become heavy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few seconds of silence, Jack transformed the topic and said: "I actually want to die that person is Louis, the old bastard has escaped legal sanctions many times. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug has some unexpected questions: "Are you familiar with him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack shakes his head Road: "Not counting, he is a patrolman, I am a criminal police, not a department. But I arrested him twice and witnessed two miserable victims, but unfortunately he was finally escaped by him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge has a sip of coffee and doesn't speak. At this time, he doesn't want to have too much relationship with Louis. It is the most sensible choice to stay completely strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope that Louis has been completely mad, and will not say what happened to him at school." Su Ge suddenly felt a little scared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no leave to leave, but who knows if the demon hunter has any other means of ghosts and traces to his own footnotes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn, be careful when you do something next time, be cautious." Su Ge decided to secretly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two people who have a mouthful of chat, and Su Ge finds that Jack is very rough, but very honest, and once mixed, a lot of words , is a good friend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very dissatisfied with the bloated and inefficient of the current judiciary, and hates the corruption of the collusion between officials and businessmen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This person is a bit interesting." Su Ge listened to Jack's complaint and thought of a possibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A person who generally has such an extreme idea and cannot achieve it, as long as he can give him some hope, he will be willing to give everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will Warren come over and ask: "How is the rest?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge Nodded. "Alright, is there a result in the interrogation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warren shook his head and said, "No, Louis’s thinking is completely chaotic, and the master has other things. I want to tell you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s heart sighed and drank the bitter coffee, sorted out his robes and said, “Let's go!” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The side of Jack looked at Su Ge and Warren’s departure, and looked envious: “This feeling is really good! The key to quickly grasp the case Point."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland came over and said faintly: "If you are willing to risk mad at any time, you can walk into this step at any time."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack's thick hair in the middle of the eye flashed a bit of struggle, then grinned and said: "still forget!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Second floor office, Su Ge sitting A chair, smoking a pipe is the opposite of Jieluo Si. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We have lost a lot of people because they have no feelings, but this tobacco can make me feel better, I hope you don't mind." Gerlos squirting Said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug shakes his head and says, "It’s okay, these cigarettes are very cute compared to the smoke in our city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss couldn’t understand these subtle humours, he continued to use his signature faceless expression: “We just tested Louis’s vision and found that his vision has At 15 o'clock, do you know what this means?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge shook his head and did not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This means that he has been influenced at least by the mysterious power of the dominator level, which led to such explosive growth in the vision." Gerlos released a heavy news . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dominator!?" Su Ge’s eyes stunned and his face horrified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was really astonished, but not because of the word dominator, but because of the shock he felt as a dominator. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warren said: "According to his scattered words and memories, he heard a very harsh and horrible voice for some reason, which is very likely Is a dominator-level musician, or other unknown profession about the mysterious aspects of sound."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will report this to the church, you are not Need to follow up," said Gerlos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded and said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the case is over, Gerlos continues: "You are now entering mystery, so you should master some basic mystery."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mystery!!" Su Ge's eyes lit up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerlos nodded: "Because you are still in the probationary period and are not eligible to enter the Holy Blood Church for systematic study, I will now simply verbally and you. Say something."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay! Thank you!" Sugton erected his ears and listened carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerousus seems to like to explain to others, saying: "We are hunters, so most of the knowledge is related to mysterious creatures, since you have already encountered Small ghouls, I will simply talk about the system of mysterious creatures."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "First of all, mysterious creatures are mainly divided into three kinds, 眷, 魔, monster. We divide them into nine levels according to the level of the spirit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"10 Spirits is a level. For example, this time the small ghoul He needs 12 points to see, so it belongs to a sequence. For example, the water ghost needs 21 points to see, so it belongs to the second sequence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"It's worth noting that although it doesn't mean that the higher the sequence, the stronger the combat power, but it is certain that the ability of the mysterious creature with higher sequence will definitely be more strange and horrible."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge nodded after listening, indicating that he had already remembered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let’s talk about the boundaries of the mysterious creature race. The so-called Dais are those who are not present in the world, are crawling out of the abyss, and are affiliated with those alien servants. The creature."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait! The amount of information in this sentence is a bit big!" Su Ge thought of a hurry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he tempted the question and said, "Where is the abyss? What are the alien evil spirits?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss said faintly: "Now you are not qualified to know, just listen to it quietly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge immediately shuts up, listens With. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Small ghouls belong to the Yi people, they are brought to the world by ancient cults, cold-hearted churches. All ghouls are eating The king of ghouls - the servant of Mordikian. This name is no secret, telling you that it is okay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My day! It is really The system of Crusoe's myth!" Hearing the name of Mordikian, Su Ge trembled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the myth of Cthulhu, Mordikian is one of the old dominators, named after the gloomy god, the ghoul king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss’s insight is very keen, looking at the contemplative Su Ge said: “What do you think of?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge's face is somewhat ugly and truthfully said: "I have heard of his legend before, it is said to be a very terrible existence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Of course, you remember. In this world, all the gods, whether they are big gods, gods, artificial pseudo-gods, or native gods that exist, cannot be seen directly. Because of that existence, we humans Just taking a look at it will cause your head to explode because you can't bear the horrible and massive unknown knowledge. Fortunately, some spirits will be shredded and become mad forever."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;</div>
