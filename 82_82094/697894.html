			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, the vision in the sky seems to have disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is not too much casualties and commotion in the city, people still go to work normally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that can be said to be big news is that the terrorists who ignited the high-calorie bomb in the southeast of the city last night ignited the entire square. Melting, but no one died, it is a blessing in misfortune. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sock standing on the edge of the square reached out and touched the melted earth, sparkling in the eyes of deep light, with reverence and awe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "With this opportunity, I will offer all my life counts." After that, quietly left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The melting square attracts the attention of a large number of unintelligible mysteries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the discerning eye can be seen at a glance, this goes far beyond the limits of humanity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the limit of humanity? That is the level that no one can reach at any level, such as the Great Sage, the Dominator, and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the kind of star-like breath that remains on the soil, and the madness that makes people feel trembling. All of them fully explained that last night, it is very likely that a presence that does not belong to this world has come to this place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ruins were not open for a long time. At nine o'clock in the morning, after the arrival of the sacred sect of the Holy Blood Church, the entire site was blocked and all the hustle and bustle was expelled. people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the church had begun to deal with the aftermath, Sugerto’s tired body finally returned to his home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lost all mystery, without the late bell, without the help of the black robe cloak, he became an ordinary person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you get here from the east, it takes two hours to go normally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, because of the night and the loss of mysterious means, Sug walked away and lost! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Left and right around, it took a full night, ten hours to find their own door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Su Ge is a little embarrassed, the hair is wet and dusty, the clothes are full of dirty stains, the dark leather shoes have been covered with dust It turned into gray, black pants, full of various white fluff and dirt, and God knew what he had experienced last night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Su Ge did not wear a hat and a mask, and the church bell, clothes and masks of the evening bell let him throw it into the trash can, after all, the body Too eye-catching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, he is an ordinary person, crossing most of the capital and returning home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the body is very tired, although he has become an ordinary person, Chu Ge is not panicked, nor afraid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He seems to be caught in a quirky contemplation at this time, giving an indescribable silence and depth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before waiting for the door to be knocked, Betty hurriedly opened the door, and looked shocked: "Adult, what's wrong with you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge returned from meditation, pale and dry lips with a flat smile: "Nothing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Said, his eyes closed and fell on Betty's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is already sleepy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Adult!" Betsy hugged Su Ge and screamed. This scene is beyond her imagination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bennis, who heard the sound, ran up two steps and step by step. When he was close to Su Ge, Bernice turned pale and said incredulously: "How? It became like this!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Send him to the bathroom." Shirley wearing pink pajamas when the two girls were at a loss Come over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two little girls will lift Su Ge to the bathroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley rolled up her sleeves and looked at the past, looking at the pale, weak ordinary Suge, muttering: "I finally came to this step."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems to be basically the same as the intelligence." Next to the trash can of a street discipline, Laurie looked at the ground full of Sleeveless trench coat with a delicate coat of arms and a weird mask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have already inquired about all the staff present, and the results are exactly the same, and Father Sini has saved everyone with that person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that person seems to send that horrible god to the astrology, but he has paid a painful price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Repulsing the gods with the human body naturally costs an incredible price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the scattered language of the clergy, Laurie analyzed that the price of Su Ge was to lose all mystery and become an ordinary person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, when he sees Sugg’s abandonment, Laurie agrees more with this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of these long-term equipments accompanying Su Ge, there has been no mysterious fluctuations, becoming completely ordinary clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He actually did this?" The archbishop of Saru was slightly moved, and it was incredible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lauri did not speak, and the actions that Su Ge is now showing are far beyond all their expectations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To protect the hostile church, to abandon all mystery of yourself, this is simply something that normal people can do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You must seize this opportunity to hold him in your hands. Even if mystery is not there, his brain has knowledge of the gods that we must master." The Archbishop clenched his fist and said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lauri turned back and nodded, turned to look at the rising sun and said: "The king of yellow clothes was seriously injured by a certain existence, now hiding in Somewhere."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“What did the apostle say?” Laurie turned and asked. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Salou Bishop said: "apostle adults say, Scotland · Sotos is still the key." <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp ;&nbsp; Laurie nodded silently and turned away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a decisive step in the pace, with a firm back in the back. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "the time has come to implement the righteous!" <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; ............ <br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Harmony is one?" In the dream, Su Ge fell into meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horrible power destroys all the channels and relationships that Suger has associated with mystery and knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Su Ge could not even return to the Kingdom of God. He could only hide in his own consciousness in this very uncomfortable way. Clumsy thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a loss of the mind of the gods, and Suge used all his thoughts to understand what it meant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nowadays, he is an ordinary person. After he has consciousness, the body is about to wake up, and consciousness cannot be considered alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, Su Ge wakes up from his dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open your eyes and see the familiar ceiling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he felt the pain in his body, especially on the soles of his feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have raised a few blisters in your feet and have already broken it. With your fragile body, it is not recommended to get out of bed now." The voice of Seoul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug did not speak, looked down and found that his dirty clothes were gone, and put on a refreshing silk pajamas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sitting slowly from the bed, Sug squinted at the bright sunshine outside the window and asked, "Has he gone?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go, haven't gone yet," Sherry answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge probably knows what this means: "Hasta’s will has been expelled by me, and the rest is just a loss of Hasta’s support The unfinished king of yellow clothes is still greedily occupying the body of Myra."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl looked at the incomparably weak Su Ge at the moment, suddenly Say: "I am killing you now, just like killing a worm."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know." Su Ge nodded calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "With your current strength, you can't continue to protect me." Shirley closed the novel and stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug turned to look at her, and the voice was calm and asked: "Would you like to go?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Shirley nodded, with a special meaning that Su Ge could not understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is the plan?" Su Ge did not stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley sat by the bed: "While you are abolished, the container is still there. I will continue to help you find the Holy Grail."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you think I am abolished?" Su Ge asked with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley’s mouth tilted slightly: “How? Don’t you?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug Stretching the hand of Shirley, the two suddenly fell silent and were not talking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A quiet time doesn't know how long it has been, Su Ge asked: "You know the heart of the world, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Know." Sherry said straightforwardly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug asks again: "What is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley reaches out his white fingers He opened the pajamas on the chest of Su Ge and gently touched the ice blue heart of Su Ge’s left chest without speaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Su Ge seems to know something, smiled and said: "Do you know their plans?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley brows slightly wrinkled and shook his head "Who are they?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug wants to open his mouth, only to find that there is no such thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl did not ask: "The timing is almost the same. She called out the old king and I should start acting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is the old king that Ada wakes up?" Su Ge heard this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one who can make Shelly call her, only Ada. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley nodded reluctantly: "I am going to the North Wind Plateau, and I wake up a little thing by the way. I don't want to be left by her. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg heard this and laughed, holding Shirley’s hand and saying, "Be careful about safety, and you really don't need it." There is such a big hostility to Ada."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley silenced and said: "You don't understand."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then two people entered the peaceful silence again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The palms of the two people are constantly stroking the opposite skin while holding them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gradually, Su Ge’s hand was a bit unscrupulous, and she touched the chest of Shirley’s white arm and touched her chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In silence, two people are lingering together and taking what they need from each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is another time, Su Ge has done everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Shirley was very satisfied with everything he wanted and succeeded in draining Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When two people calm down, time has come to the evening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s eyes looked at the ceiling a little, and he didn’t know how it came over these hours, because he lost all mystery and he was totally immersed in it. Wushan is in the rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He felt that he had spent the last few hours in the stimuli. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;趴雪莉尔 beside him looked at Su Ge’s face, his skin was a bit white, I don’t know if it was because of last night’s problem, Because of her suffering, there is an unnatural white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What plans do you have next? You are a waste now." Shelley got up and put on her clothes, and the tone was very rude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge returned to God, there is not much fear in his voice: "Even if there is no mystery, I am still me, no one will affect my existence, no one I can cut off my cause and effect."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is very confident, just as Su Ge didn't just lose mystery at this time, even higher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shelly combed her dark hair, most of it in the hair, leaving only a glimpse of the goddess scattered in the back, in the blink of an eye, from the beautiful and fascinating goddess, It became a beautiful woman who was so tempting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug sees this embarrassment, this hairstyle will only be combed by a married woman, this is the first time he sees Shirley combing this hairstyle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well look?" After combing, Shirley turned a circle and asked at the corner of his mouth with a smile from the country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded hard: "Good-looking, I have seen the best, most beautiful, most charming woman."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shelly smiled hard to expand again, she took a shot, countless darkness, forming a seductive black dress covering her body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This attire is exactly the same as when you first met Su Ge in the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this going?" Su Ge had some disappointment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shelly’s eyes have a complex look: “Now is the best time. If you miss it, I will never leave. No matter what I am now the strongest moment. In this rare balance, you and I can't hesitate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is very contradictory, because Su Ge is not fart now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge sat up, turned and walked to the edge of the suitcase, and touched for a long time to come up with a very worn gold bracelet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is worn out, it is still pure gold, and it is full of weight, and the price is at least 200 ng. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; turned and wore on Shirley’s wrist: “This is the family of my family. My parents secretly hid it and intended to take my wife.” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, Sug smiled: "It’s not used now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Shelly raised her wrist and watched it completely detached from her. The rustic, worn gold bracelet swayed like a swan-winged wrist, and nodded with satisfaction: "I like it very much."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a trick, the same mask as the white ghost mask of the church in the evening bell appeared in her hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Committed to your pursuit, from now on, I am also the church of the late bell." Saying, wearing a mask on his face, Xue Lier Make a darkness and disappear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge reached out and wanted to grab the darkness, but did not catch anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the bedroom is empty, if it is not the blisters in the soles of the feet, he thought it was a dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go and go. Everything in the world is like this, cycle back and forth." Su Ge said, sitting back on the bed and looking out the window through the window. The moon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden muffled sound downstairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug hurriedly put on his clothes and went on: "What's wrong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;British hands With a trace of blood on his palm, he said: "Three human face rats and a ghoul have been dealt with."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
