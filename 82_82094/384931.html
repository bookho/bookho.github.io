			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Pope's Majesty!" At this time, Vanas was covered with a piece of rag that did not know where to find it. When he saw the state of Su Ge, immediately The screaming rushed over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s hoarse voice said, “Don’t come, my blood is poisonous because of the potion. I’m still dead, let’s go and tell Randall. And Master Mill."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas nodded after listening: "You wait, I will be back soon!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, turned and took the long legs under the skirt and ran out quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Vanas just walked for a minute, Suger heard the sound of footsteps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Vanas!?" Su Ge asked, twisting his neck and turning his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This look, Su Ge’s face was very ugly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person who came is not Vanas, but a human with a bulging, black skin and a purple skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This human body seems to have been re-stitched, walking a little sly, his face is gloomy and twisted, like abomination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The skin of the whole body is exposed outside and looks very disgusting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of this person has been distorted, and there are various pustules and scary wounds on the pus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's it, Su Ge still recognizes it, this person is Hayden! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hyden at this time did not know where to hide, did not receive the destruction of two deaths. But the body seems to have been affected by the last madness of the Son of God, becoming the horror of today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sug! Su Ge!" I don't know if the flow is saliva or the mouth of the thick water is hoarse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s all because of you! It’s all because of you!" He screamed wildly in his mouth, reaching out to his chest and squatting. My own bright red heart is coming out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The psionic spirit was injected into the heart, and he actually made a dead bomb with his own heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Kill you! Kill you!" Blood splattered and limped towards this side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;趴On the ground, Su Ge whispered: "Hayden, everything is over, you don't have to go on."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This has nothing to do with the other, I was taught the right command and curse, is to kill you!" Hayden looked very mean, snoring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear this, Su Ge immediately knows why he can live to the present. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Want to move the body, I find myself completely uncontrolled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug immediately mobilized his psionic power, passing through the heart, a thick bell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come on! Chop me up with your sound! Oh, I’m not afraid to tell you, my body is a huge dead bomb, once I receive it. The outside attack, the plague that broke out can spread to the range of 30 meters, Su Ge, you must die today!" Hayden's mouth said, the saliva mixed with the thick water on his face splashed in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear this, Su Ge has been ready to stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This guy shouldn't lie." The ripples of the late bell passed through Hayden's body, and Sug found that his body was a very dangerous, frantic The spirit is full, just like a bomb that is about to explode. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Exactly, since the physical attack is invalid, try the funeral effect. Directly kill the soul, but also eliminate the curse similar to the evil spirits." Su Ge quickly thought about calling his own knowledge about funeral. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a quick knowledge of the funeral, another bell rang out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How? Don't dare to attack me, but also want to scare me away with the bell? Hehe..." Hayden said that he had to raise his arm and prepare to put his hand. The dead bomb was thrown over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge still calmly, his dark eyes looked at Hayden and suddenly asked: "How do you want to die?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heiden heard a glimpse, then spit out Concentrated water, hoarse and said: "How can I die without your management?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge's mouth reveals a strange smile: "Let it live! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, Hayden suddenly felt the continuous bells in his ear a little embarrassed, sometimes no, suddenly far and near. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Useless! Any means are useless, you will die today..." Hayden waited, and suddenly felt his mouth out of control. Can't open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He returned to God, turned his head and saw that he was lying in a wooden coffin at this time, this coffin had no cover, and his eyes could see That gray gloomy sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the whole body lost control and could not move, so lying in the coffin so calmly, like a dead person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's the matter!? This is illusion!?" Hayden suddenly thought of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Heiden’s death is terrible." A voice suddenly came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heiden heard the sound and saw the person around him who was on the left front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four squatters are all wearing black robes, and the face under the huge hood is hidden in the shadows. It’s amazing and scary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呜呜呜..." Hayden wants to talk, but finds that he can't open his mouth anyway, he has completely lost his body. control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The embarrassed person raised his head slightly, Hayden saw this guy is actually the necromancer in the Institute of Polar Studies, Kent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Kent’s face with some strange smiles, watching Hayden say: “Biden Hayden, please don’t be afraid, don’t be confused. We’ve already You are holding a funeral in Longzhong. In this sacred, solemn funeral, your soul must be redeemed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"?? Funeral? My funeral?" Hayden heard that this heart was even more puzzled, and the whole body struggled violently, but it did not help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Advance about twenty meters, Hayden felt himself being put down, looking through the edge of the coffin, he saw the four black robes Standing in a solemn manner, the sacred appearance seems to be holding a sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gradually, there were other people behind the four people. These people were all in all kinds of colors, but they all wore neat black clothes, indicating solemnity and dignity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heiden saw that his eyes were getting bigger. He saw his parents among these people, saw the teacher who was killed by himself, and saw that he used to Killing enemies, seeing the wife and son who died by their own failures...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time they stood calmly, using a kind of let The creepy eyes stared at himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呜呜呜...呜呜呜..." Hayden began to struggle fiercely. He felt very bad at this time, he wanted to talk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, he can’t say it, he can’t move it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! Boom! Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heavy, solemn bells came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bell is full of oppression, and people feel dull and heart-wrenching, just as there are people who have a close relationship with their own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the bells, these people gradually lowered their heads, their expressions were full of respect, and seemed to be waiting for someone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heiden seems to feel something, his eyes wide open, his heart begins to accelerate, as if something terrible is about to happen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few seconds later, a man in a black robe with four dark wings, and a creature burning under the hood appeared next to his coffin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this form, Hayden seems to have seen something terrible, his eyes are torn apart, his body is struggling, his head is shaking, he wants go away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unknown winged creature slowly squats down and reaches out and points to his chest: "The lost soul, unloading all your burdens and getting on the road easily."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, Hayden saw something he couldn't describe. He didn't know what it was, but when he saw it, he knew that he was dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am dead!?" Hayden instinctively thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hayden, all the way, hope that you can become a good father in the afterlife," his wife said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hayden, we will remember you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hayden, how suddenly Did you die before the teacher?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, it turned out I am dead." Hayden heard this and thought of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he stopped struggling and accepted the current situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, he was placed in the cemetery by four squatters, and the acquaintances around him took out the shovel and shoveled the soil and buried it on him. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The side, the unknown winged creature voice is low and said: "Listen to this bell! This is the redemption of the gospel, follow the night clock, release the soul, Enjoy the eternal peace."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the bell, Hayden felt that he was deeply buried in the ground, losing everything in a peaceful and peaceful way...<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reality, Hayden’s body collapsed to the ground, and the godless eyes have lost their looks and sluggishly in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His ugly body gradually returned to normal, motionless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body at this time is not dead, but the soul is dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
