			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is the cause and effect?" Su Ge took back his temptation to turn his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Weiss smiled: "Nothing, just thought of some past events."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp After that, the old Weiss put the lantern on the waist, and looked at the surrounding mountains and the distant clouds and asked: "What do you think of this dreamland?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "This should be a broken world, in the meridian of the world and the dream." Su Ge said his previous analysis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Visen said: "Not very accurate, but it is similar. It is the safest and most perfect haven for some people." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Su Ge’s heart moved slightly, but did not ask much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You should wake up, otherwise I will be in trouble." Old Weiss said, reaching for Suge's shoulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment he touched his hand, Su Ge felt a horrible suction coming from the palm of the old Weiss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole world has become distorted, and his body has begun to shrink rapidly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It all happened in an instant, and he didn't even have room to react and think. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he returned to God, he saw the familiar white ceiling and the beautiful and delicate glass chandelier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you awake?" Shelly's voice came from the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug turned and looked at the chair next to the window, Shirley wearing a pajamas leaning freely on top of it, holding a copy in his hand The book looked seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bright, warm sun shines through the window on her white skin, like a jade crystal clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s already 12 o'clock in the afternoon?" Su Ge licked his head and sat up and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a little afternoon." Shirley turned over a book and corrected it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge shook his head and looked down to see that his clothes had been taken off and replaced with gray pajamas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Make a dream, feel tired." Su Ge stretched his body and said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley glanced at him: "Betty is preparing lunch for you, and someone else needs your help."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The actress."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su The grid is not in a hurry: "I will wash it first, so it is not convenient to see people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half an hour, after washing, the spirited Sug walks Going downstairs, I just saw that Mary was sitting there with some anxiety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss Mary, what happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary after seeing Sug Suddenly, I said, "Thank you! Mr. Assin, you are finally awake."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge took over the hot milk that Betty handed over. One bit, indicating that she continues to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Anji, she had a problem. She seemed to have had a nightmare last night. I got up this morning and I was nervous. I locked myself in the room. I don’t see it, my mouth has been shouting with a dust storm, it seems like a demon.” When it comes to this, Mary’s expression is full of fear and worry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Sug bit a big bite of the sandwich and turned and said, "Go, look at it now."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He needs some important sign to determine some of his own projections. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is one!" Betty hurriedly wrapped the second sandwich and handed it to Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg took over and followed the anxious Miss Mary and quickly left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the night of the night, the city of Hui Yao in the day did not see any abnormal anomalies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The place where Mary lives is very close to here, and it takes less than ten minutes for two people to walk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary's apartment is about the same size as the Bernice apartment, and the layout is similar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the main entrance, Su Ge first smelled a thick alcohol. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He then saw a somewhat messy living room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women, shoes, scarves, hats, etc. are thrown everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary was a little embarrassed and hurried forward to pick up her hat and scarf and put it in the closet: "Sorry, things are urgent, I haven’t cleaned up yet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled and shook his head: "What about Miss Angie?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Upstairs." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people walked up the stairs to the second floor of the second floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the Su Ge, you can hear a horrified whisper: "The sandstorm is coming! The sandstorm is coming! We will all be buried alive, no one can escape." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge, standing at the door, heard this, reaching for the door handle, the psionics and knowledge were transmitted at the same time, and then the unlocked door was opened directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relatively small bedrooms are full of wine bottles, and the room is filled with pungent blood and smoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clothes were messy and still on the ground, and the ashtrays near the windows were filled with the remaining cigarette butts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bedding on the bed was also very messy, and Angie’s voice came from the bedside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night bell was released, and Su Ge felt that Angie’s body curled up under the bed, wrapped in a quilt, with his hands on his head, and his body trembled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge stepped to the edge of the bed, and the shoes and the ground hit a crisp, squeaky sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this ordinary voice is like the most horrible voice in the world for Angie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a moment, a screaming scream in her mouth, shouted: "Don't come over! You monster! Don't come over!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calling, she ran out of the bed with a roll of climbing, and the body rushed toward the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be careful!" Mary screamed as she suddenly screamed, then her body slammed forward and stopped Angie who was going to jump from the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug raises his hand here, and the night bell of the soul of the town passes it out, suddenly letting the inexplicable Anji calm down, the body before the rush is stiff, Mary hugged and pressed it to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge walked in two steps and looked down at Anji, who was pressed to the ground. The voice was calm and asked: "Should you calm down?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anji’s face is still pale at this time, but the whole spirit seems to be much more calm, with some light in his eyes and his expression returning to normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She blinked and muttered, "What happened to me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Nothing, just scared." Su Ge said, turned and walked to the door: "Let's change places, the smell in this room is too exciting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; At this time, Anji had already taken care of her face. With Mary’s help, she stood up weakly and looked around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be afraid! Mr. Assin is very strong and will definitely protect you. You have just gone crazy, it is Mr. Assassin that makes you recover. "After helping her, Mary's voice calmed." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anji thoughts are still somewhat blocked, nodded dull, followed down the stairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the living room, Mary cleaned up a neat place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sit down, Su Ge looked at Anji and said, "Talk about the dream you saw yesterday."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this Angie is still a little bit undecided, but the evening clock The spirit of the town is very powerful, and she is not overwhelmed by fear again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was yesterday, dreaming that I was drowned in the sea by the boat. The sea was full of horrible monsters. They caught me and dragged me into In the deep sea, I was struggling desperately, but I was only dragged deeper and deeper..." When it came to this, Angie’s body trembled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge asks: "What do those monsters look like?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I...remember Clear." Angie frowned, it looked very painful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly and continued to ask: "After?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anji hand strokes Said: "After that I seem to have come to a weird city, a group of monsters surrounded me in the middle, constantly telling me something messy, I can't understand anything. After that..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, her hand is more exaggerated: "So big things touch me, and in the next second I suddenly find myself returning home."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug did not speak, indicating that she would continue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anji swallowed his mouth and looked very ugly: "I thought I was back, I was scared, so I went out to find Mary."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking that she squeezed Mary’s hand: "But when I saw Mary, Mary... Mary has become a dry corpse... seems to be sucked dry by the desert The corpse of all the water."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mary on the side heard this, his face was not very good. She has been exposed to the mysterious mystery, and some things in dreams are likely to become reality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge comforted and said: "This is just an intention, not a real thing. Rest assured, since I know, I will not let this Things happened."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing the words of Su Ge, Mary’s inexplicable peace of mind was full of security. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anji continued: "I saw more fear afterwards. I ran out of my way. When I opened the door, I suddenly felt a hot wind blowing in the air. I was blown to the ground. Then there was a sting, countless The gravel was blown by the wind and hit my face."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am more afraid, get up and run out to find the help of the church. But when I When I walked out of the gate, I found that the sky covered the entire city. The previously prosperous city is now covered with dust everywhere. The wind blows me down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "I ran wildly, but found that everyone on the street became a horrible corpse. I was scared and stupid, sitting on the sand. At this time I looked up and found an indescribable Fear, huge shadows shrouded the entire city, and I saw countless ghosts and huge monsters flying in the sky."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After that, the sandstorm in the distance is like Like the monsters that devour the heavens and the earth, they are coming to the city. I'm about to be scared crazy when I regained consciousness ...... "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; After listening to these, Scotland lost in thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anji was sitting there undecided, his body curled up like a frightened child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary will not hand over a cup of hot coffee, Anji holds the coffee, feeling the warm temperature and the realism, the trembling heart finally There is a tendency to calm down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge simply remembered the content and said, "Okay, I already know the general situation. You don't have to worry too much about this, I Just staying nearby, you can go directly to me if something goes wrong."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, the contemplative Sug turned and prepared to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That... Mr. Assassin, I... is it okay?" Angie asked uneasily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge said: "This is a question left over from your last participation in the ceremony. Those monsters seem to be sending warnings to you through some reason for some reason." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Angie’s face was pale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
