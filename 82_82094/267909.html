			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irene while eating a sandwich, looked at Su Ge and asked, "Who are you? It doesn't look like a church person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled: "How do you know that I am not a church?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sucking your fingers The cream on the tip, the beautiful wheat face with a confident answer: "I have had a lot of dealings with the church people, you have no bloody smell on them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bloody smell?" Su Ge stunned, although Emilia said that the clerics were easily discovered by others with a special temperament, but he did not expect it to be bloody? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illina looked at Su Ge’s unexpected expression and hesitated: "This expression is not pretending. Isn’t he really a person in this circle? Even the special atmosphere of the Church of the Holy Blood does not know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge certainly does not know that he has been from the mysterious circle before, and all around him are clergymen. In the undifferentiated atmosphere, where can I feel a special atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge asked curiously: "What is the bloody smell?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See Sugna looked curious, and Elena suddenly remembered her younger brother who was curious about everything, and explained: "It is the kind of messy bloody smell, and the sweetness in the trace of astringency. "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"??" Su Ge heard this is even more aggressive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illina continues to explain: "Although blood therapy has been popular for many years, there are many formula systems in the middle, but the core blood used by each other is different. We are folk Most of the formula system uses the dragon blood as the base container, and the three church blood treatments are based on the more rare Jianlong blood. The long-term use or contact will be contaminated with this bloody smell. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge squinted: "Is the base container 啥?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before When I was reading a book, I read a lot of classifications, but I forgot to forget the books on blood therapy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It’s really a little white!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illina’s heart sighs and continues to explain: “Blood therapy is very complicated, and different blood is between each other. It is not compatible, and the rush of mixing is only a dead end. Therefore, it is necessary to have a more powerful medium that has the genes of ancient creatures, which can suppress and contain all blood at the genetic level, so that different blood can be merged with each other. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear this Su Ge, you understand that the so-called base container is the glucose water used to dissolve the drug when it is on the earth. Or saline. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "See how good you are, how is the basic knowledge so lacking?" Elena had a trace of doubt on her face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled: "My energy is not on this side, you know that people have limited energy."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illina recalls the good friend who is still busy today, and nodded in agreement: "Yes! People's energy is really limited."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This topic is over, Su Ge turned and asked: "Now your injury is good, is there any plan?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Injury, Elena said with a serious look: "Thank you for your help. Thank you for your help yesterday, or they will be caught by them. It is estimated that this is not the case."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "The Institute of Polar Studies, I have dealt with them a few times, are a group of madmen, I don't mind seeing one killing this kind of person." Referring to this organization, Su Ge's tone suddenly cooled down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the temperament of Su Ge at this time, Elena’s eyes are flowing: “This little guy seems to be a good person.” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't like to owe someone else's things. I will do my best to repay this kind of love. When I handle this matter, I will Try to repay your kindness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s heart: "This is the starting point for the farewell, this is not enough, I still have a lot of questions. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Su Ge immediately said: "If you want to repay my kindness, it is very simple, here, you can do it now."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard this Elena suddenly jumped in my heart: "Here? Now? Is it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a time, Elena feels a little hot and pounces in her heart. Plop it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What should I do? If he really asks for that..." I thought, Irina looked up and looked at Sug and found that the boy still looked Very handsome, and elegant and courteous, do not let you hate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you can repay your kindness, I don't mind." Elena decided in her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then, she seemed to think of something, immediately reminded: "I will say first, I am a witch."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, I know, what happened?" Su Ge didn't pay attention to her mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illina said solemnly: "If you want to...want to have a physical relationship with me, please give up this idea."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Hearing this, Sugerton was speechless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Does my face look so bad?" Su Ge felt that his confidence had been severely hit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this blow was quickly covered by new intelligence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" Su Ge asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illina explained: "I don't know exactly what the reason is, but according to the knowledge circulating in the mystery and what I saw with my own eyes, all the relationship with the witch The people are very bad at the end."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How bad is it?" Su Ge asked seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illina answered seriously: "It’s very miserable. I have seen a nobleman who met a sperm on the brain and prepared a qj witch. I was rushing over. It was already late, just to see the damn guy lying on my compatriots."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
