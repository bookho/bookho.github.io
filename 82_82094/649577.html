			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a relatively old church on the south side of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of the blood-hunter was placed on a stone platform full of quirky lines and surrounded by reliefs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three people around Shitai. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One is the Archbishop of the Holy Blood Church, Laurie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is the central archbishop Saru who wears a golden robe with a mask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third place is a black pharaoh with a dark, bald skin and a white tooth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three stood together with the Black Pharaoh and could see both Saru and Laurie with respect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The soul is completely dissipated and is directly dispelled by the mystery of death and soul. Although the body does not have the psionic traces of the conventional form, it is very heavy. Mysterious causality. The plan for both of you is very good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Pharaoh glanced at him with satisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Laurie tempted: "Apostle, can you tell where Soge Sotos is?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Pharaoh said faintly: "Can."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then we will catch this heresy!" Saru immediately Suggestions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Pharaoh’s face gradually became serious and solemn: “I know it is the revelation that the goddess gave me, but this revelation is not for you. You are the child of the goddess. It is a servant. The goddess is not your mother, paving the way for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, the two people suddenly looked ugly and hurriedly bowed their heads. "Yes! It is the ignorance of my servant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can give you guidance and help, but it does not mean that I will handle this matter for you." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes! We already have our plan." Laurie replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Pharaoh nodded slightly, and waved his hand. One looks clean, that is, some cold youths appear with the cold wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is Naia Latotip, the goddess who helped you. This name has a special meaning for Suger Sotos. When necessary, as long as you pass the name in some way, he will definitely change."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people looked at the youth and nodded hard Dao: "Thanks to the goddess' gift, the apostle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Pharaoh continued: "I already know about the Holy Spirit and the Holy Blood Maze, the Pope. There is nothing wrong with the decision of Star Court."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Treating Su Ge Sotos, you can use any means. But remember, don't hurt his life." Black Pharaoh reminded again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two nodded again and agreed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They, as Su Ge thought, did not intend to kill Suge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And not to mention the knowledge in Su Ge’s head that they don’t know, the one of the storm emperors alone gave them deep jealousy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The church in March today ushered in the most fragile period in which they ruled the world for nearly 10,000 years, and could not be extravagant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After talking, the black pharaoh left with a young man named Naia, saying that he first handed him some common-sense knowledge and handed it over to the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the black Pharaoh left, Saru and Laurie secretly sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nominally, the spokesperson of the March goddess is the three popes of the March church, as well as the saints. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in reality, the only one who can truly speak to the goddess of March is one person, that is, the apostle who does not know how long he has lived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This apostle is not undead, and everyone is sure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Laurie remembers that he had seen this apostle when he was a child, but decades have passed, and the apostles still do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and even more terrifying is that according to the words of three centuries old saints, in their childhood, even in the early days of the saints, The apostle is like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strength of the apostle adult, no one dares to guess, but its existence is already a testament to power and miracles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has three goddesses at the same time, can walk freely in the three holy grail maze, and even directly contact the body of the Holy Grail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has infinite knowledge, and in the past few hundred years, the church has played an indelible great achievement in the development of the church, giving the church countless Taboo knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the church that can be disassembled and assembled, the flying steel battleships, such as blood wine, such as those forbidden human trials, have the merits of the apostles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His whereabouts are erratic, sometimes he has been away for decades, and there are traces of him all over the world, each time with the teaching of knowledge, with God The appearance of the trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't expect the apostle to really respond to our call this time." Laurie said with amazement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the ancient city, the face of the church in March was greatly damaged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Grail Labyrinth had highlighted some problems at that time, so the Holy Blood Pope sent a call to the apostles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The apostle was very interested in hearing about the passing of the ancient city, so he returned from day and night, helping them to stabilize the turmoil of the maze, and personally presided over The mysterious ban on the existence of Sog Sotos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time expressed a clear interest in the existence of Soge Sotos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
