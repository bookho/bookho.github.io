			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scene is completely deadlocked at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge calmly said: "I believe that the things recorded in my book are urgently needed by you. I only understand this book. A little bit of something, even if you eat, I can't know the truth, but this book can."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen’s face suddenly sinks completely, and the lot of tentacles stretches. Strong, ready to go, but stuck in the air and did not dare to move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She can see the horrible vibrations and sharp edges. She is also very clear that as long as the control of Su Ge is lost, those vibrations and sharp edges will instantly rush away, and they have no ability to save the book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, she can feel a sense of familiarity in this book, which makes her believe in what Su Ge said at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are your requirements?" asked the palace calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s body retreats slightly: “We only hope to be safe to leave here.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Queen After listening to the indifference, "Yes, I will swear by my great ancestors, the great Byron the Great, as long as you leave this book, I will definitely let you leave here."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge seems to be very satisfied with the oath made by the Queen, said with a smile: "If this is the case, it is really good, this is a win-win situation."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Su Ge bent down and left the book on the ground, with two people turning around and running towards the passage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three people ran very fast, but they were quicker than the Queen’s tentacles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know where the tentacles came from directly blocking the passage, and the other tentacle had already sent the book to the back of the emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You...you dare to violate the oath!" Su Ge was angry at this moment, accusing and accusing the queen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It feels good to play Su Ge between the palms. The Queen is not in a hurry to kill three people at this time. He sneer: "Byron is just a loser! I am the great man who is about to master the Holy Grail of the Soul. Still afraid of his bondage?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, the giant soldiers around him suddenly flocked to three people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg was very angry at this time, and shouted: "Work with them!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So three people and the innumerable giant soldiers fought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The queen in the sky picked up this red book, and when I saw the words "Frenzy Book" on the cover, it was a source of instinct. The fear and surrender surrendered into the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This book is absolutely related to that adult!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen suddenly got excited . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eighty-five years ago, a middle-aged man with dark skin, a smile and a sly smile visited the ancient city of Aya, and the secret that had been dusty for a long time, and disappeared in The truth in the long river of history tells two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, they knew the existence of the Holy Grail, knew the nobleness of their own blood, and knew the sunken Byron City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the one who brought the key to everything, their ancestors, the curse of Byron the Great. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later, the middle-aged man also gave them the legendary Yi: Xiu Gesi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the help of Schuges, they can build incredible buildings and incomparably complex urban structures without anyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; even built this majestic underground palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything is ready, they self-directed a landslide, let the ancient city of the city be removed from history, and since then the ancient city has been isolated from the world and became a legend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they started their great plans and great experiments in this isolated city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city has been destroyed again and again, and it has been broken again and again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After rebuilding with the help of Hugues, it is becoming more and more complex and more and more magnificent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the residents are re-launched, experiment again...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, two months ago, They have succeeded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They found the special rhythm and successfully summoned Byron City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The husband and wife, both brothers and sisters, can have today’s achievements thanks to the guidance of the mysterious middle-aged man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they know the middle-aged people, they only know that he is called a creepy hybrid, has countless incarnations, has endless Knowledge, with an indescribable power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, they don’t know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, in this book, she finally feels the familiar atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, she can't wait to open the book, the first thing she sees is the messy lines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, her eyes did not stay on the line, but quickly turned back and looked at the real content. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the ground, Su Ge broke a wave of two soldiers after a vibrating punch. His eyes glanced at the queen who was reading a book, and his mouth showed a strange smile. First words: "Give me the ground for a while!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good!" Andrew said calmly, kicking a soldier out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the air, when the Queen saw the contents of the book, the eyes gradually enlarged, first full of surprises, and then full of excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But then, one of her eyes was full of fear and despair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No! No! This...this is not that adult! This is not that adult!" The palace was completely flustered and began to struggle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the swollen body began to wriggle and flip, as if it was going crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This moment, the dark cloak hunting, Su Ge vacated to the sky with her whispered: "This is certainly not Nayalato Tip! This is He!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Naya Latotip..." The queen suddenly stopped hearing the name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has exhausted decades of experience only knowing that the name of the adult is the beginning of Naia, so far she does not know the real name of that adult. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, she did not expect to know the name of that adult at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just at the moment of her loss of consciousness, Su Ge suddenly appeared behind the wings of death, the blue misty robes added, the ghosts and ghosts suddenly burned in the eyes . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A heavy bell rang, and Sugna was full of sacred and solemn voices: "How do you want to die?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The queen who was in the middle of the loss heard this, and the instinctive thought in her mind remembered the city that had been burned many times. She was watching the mutant residents burned to death, she has been I am very curious, what it feels like to be burned to death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So she followed this, instinctively said: "burned."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! Boom! Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This voice just fell, three sacred, solemn, heavy voices came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each bell is radiating around with a majestic dark glow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the midst of it, a horrible rule that is above all life is wrapped around the huge body of the palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen who felt the wrong moment returned to God, only to find that his body had been infected with countless deaths. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is..." She was terrified in an instant, her eyes wide open and looked at the god of death floating in front of herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Night clock..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under her waiting, Su Ge sounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Crematory!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the god of death is a verdict on the soul of sin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the general sacred voice of the rules of heaven and earth, the Queen suddenly felt a whirlwind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, she found herself back to normal humans, and she was tied to the cross at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a fire everywhere, and the hot flames and smoke made her breathless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No... No! Don't! My great cause! My Holy Grail!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She Struggling with desperation, but to no avail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gradually, her wide eyes found a lot of residents outside watching the fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were burnt black, but they didn’t die, looked at themselves with empty eyes, and opened their dark lips to reveal the terrible teeth, every A demon like a ready to eat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Burn it! Burn it! Burn it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the voices of these villagers, She felt the endless burning pain, as if all the pain of the burned villagers in the past 80 years had been transferred to her body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In desperate fear, she saw her body become black, and then gradually turned into fly ash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turns out that being burned to death is this feeling."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last she murmured Thinking, representing the shape of her entire soul, the smoke is gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the underground palace, Andrew and Randall, who were struggling to fight, found that the giant soldiers suddenly froze around and remained motionless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, these soldiers lost their bones and suddenly fell to the ground, so they died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bang.........<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a heavy roar, the huge body in front slammed down Ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The queen can see the big eyes at this time, his face is awkward, but there is no soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She, is dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My God!" Andrew saw this scene, even if he had to fight through battles, it was shocked like a child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This terrible existence, that's it... dead! ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He feels that he is dreaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger’s body fell from the sky, accompanied by a blue mist, and the robes and wings disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Su Ge held his cane with his hands on his pale head and coughed twice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This funeral was very successful and was the most successful of his history. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen relied on the shape of the swollen woman, theoretically the level of the lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But because she does not inherit knowledge, only strong flesh, but no corresponding spells and powers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even then, she is still the same as the giant emperor, belonging to the real higher creatures, far beyond the human sphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug is very aware of her form, so he is always looking for opportunities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of a funeral is very powerful and special. It is a cause and effect, or a rule, a sanction and deprivation that can cross all boundaries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
