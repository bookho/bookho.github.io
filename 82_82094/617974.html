			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the two people who left, Green and Coase both felt very uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only disgusting look of Shirley, the scornful tone of the throat, so that the two people are now very uncomfortable, as if a mess in the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The woman, who is it?" Coase asked with a slight wrinkle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green played with a short cane and said: "It’s just a little nervous. Now think back, she looks exactly the same as Ada Newton." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ada Newton!? The female madman!?" Hearing this Coase look surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green brow slightly wrinkled: "I...somewhat uncertain, but it should be similar."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp At this moment, the influence of Shirley in his mind is rapidly blurred, which makes him somewhat inaccurate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ada Newton... Now all the churches are looking for her, I heard that the Holy Blood Church has sent a saint to find her." Coase said . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Saint!?" This time Green was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the saint? That is the powerful existence of the three organs of the ruling and the Pope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the rumor, every saint is a mysterious person at the great sage level, and his occupation is a hidden secret. Cos nodded: "After all, Ada Newton has caused too many incidents. According to incomplete statistics, from her appearance to the present two years, already Almost 10,000 people died because of her, and the way of dying was strange. Even many churches sent her to chase her, and her clerics did not know what to do, but died to protect her."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green brows locked and fell into deep meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His mysterious world has a lot of tentacles, so he has heard some of these messages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This...man, is there a relationship with Ada Newton?" Coase asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name of Suger Sotos has been completely harmonious in March, and the general mystery can’t read it. Green shook his head: "This is not very clear. According to intelligence, he did rent it with a female tenant before, but what the female tenant looks like, No one knows what it is called."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a time, two people fell into deep meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Still and talk to your Majesty." For a long time, Coase made a decision and said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the only way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;..................<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other side, Su Ge took Shirley and took his luggage and walked on the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the imperial city of the city, the streets can be said to be very prosperous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lot of foreigners on the wide streets with luggage and roads, as well as noble ladies dressed in fiber optic and shopping with each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can also see the handsome guys in the two and three. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are high-rise buildings on both sides of the street, and there are some shops in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are people who sell clothes, have food, sell jewelry, and specialize in divination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where, Su Ge even stunned himself back to the Earth’s magical pedestrian street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Just the worm said to give you information, no interest in listening?" Shelly asked as she looked at the shops on both sides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger said casually: "What important news can they have in their hands? It’s nothing more than information about witch hunting."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No interest?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course, but I am not in a hurry. Since they offered it, it means they are in a hurry. From the attitude of two people It can be seen that the emperors and churches of the empire have been complaining for a long time, and they have reached the point of wanting to secretly use the means to make the opposite side ugly." Su Ge said casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl said: "More and more skilled."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course Sugla lived with her hand and pointed to the small trader on the side and said, "Is there a wine noodle, try it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Try it!" Snow Lill’s eyes lit up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She likes to eat and prefers sweets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glass noodles is a unique snack in the world. It is a sweet food made from fine flour, wine and sugar. The type belongs to the candy, contained in the mouth. Not only sweet, but also a touch of wine, is the special product of the Imperial Capital. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, as a special product of the emperor, there is still a feature, that is expensive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two round white sugar pieces of two centimeters in diameter, which cost a 50 cents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like a white marshmallow block in your mouth, very hard and sweet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The candy is a bit big, and Shirley has two gongs in his mouth, and the sinister and cold face is finally a little cute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley seems to like it very much, with his eyes closed, his mouth constantly emitting the sound of candy and teeth colliding, tasting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug has a candy bar and smiles at Shelly at this time. At this moment, he likes her sincerely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, she opened her eyes and looked at Su Ge’s soft and affectionate smile, screaming twice, holding Su Ge’s hand, containing The sugar cubes are vaguely said: "It's too delicious, it's too expensive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Langke is the gold standard, one gram is almost equal to 300rmb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two pieces of sugar fifty cents, on average, a piece of sugar ... 75 pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, at this time, Su Ge had no time to count these things, he said with a pleasant mood: "When I study research methods, we will do it ourselves later."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley listened to his eyes slightly bright, then turned his head and sighed and continued to taste the delicious taste in his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next time the two did not go too far, Su Ge is not a superman, taking advantage of the stupidity of shopping, he does not have this kind of physical capital. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After lunch, two people came out of the restaurant to find a place to stay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just out of the restaurant, Sug just saw the street across the street, a beautiful lady in a blue dress with a parasol looking at herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this lady, Sug laughed and walked over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well!?" A sherry who sat next to her face saw this moment with a glimpse of her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge whispered: "She is the one I told you before."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Over the past year, Su Ge and her have said a lot of their previous things, including the opportunity to set up the church in the late night, Hills and Bernice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Shirley’s expression gradually returned to normal, looking at Bernice’s look, then nodded slightly: “Some people are like.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluation of the words of Shirley shows that Bernice is not a bug in her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Bernice, the only person who can get the above evaluation is Vanas, who has never been masked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benice here can not recognize the Su Ge at this time, but through the contact of hunting, she knows that this is her own benefactor, herself Idols and heroes in my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a happy face, and even some of them are accelerating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
