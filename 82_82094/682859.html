			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear is not surprised to hear this news: "You can handle it. As for the actions of the Glorious Church, after the time is up, my apostles will deal with it. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Following." Vanas answered with respect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are other things?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas is slightly covered and says: "According to In the night of the land of the Hills report, the old king's palace has changed, the knight who has been sleeping for many years suddenly began to take regular action, contact the outside world. At the same time, according to rumors, has been sleeping in the throne of the old king, now I disappeared and didn't know where I went."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The old king who belongs to the undead, it should be one of the six ancient kings. For special reasons to hide After the sanctions of the Death of the Valley, but perhaps it was some kind of heavy damage, lost some memory or authority, so sleep to the present."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My wise. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But since he dares to act in this world, it shows how much she has restored some of her previous knowledge and authority."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas did not dare to ask, bowed his head and waited for instructions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is there any special change in the world recently?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas tidy up the recent According to intelligence, "According to the recent report of Gerlos, the Church of the Holy Blood investigated a large cult ceremony in the past few days. The location is located in the Harvard Castle on the back of the Union League, and the leader is a dominator."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well." Su Ge nodded slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas continues: "All cultists are annihilated. And the objects they hold are not evil spirits, nor gods, but the world itself." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge as a god is not as fascinating as human beings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Trying to link the world's roots and undermine the rules of the world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My wise man. The purpose of these people is to break the vision system of the present world, even the mysterious net they are prepared to intervene in the world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mystery is covered in The big net of the world, which is intricate and complicated, involves a whole body, which is the mysterious fluctuation of the mysterious world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The thinking of this ignorant person is so superficial. They enhance the mysterious influence by making sacrifices to the mysterious net, enhancing the mysterious source of the world. Finally, the mystery is fully integrated into life, and the mysterious scale is returned to the gods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The ultimate goal is to let the gods come to the world again." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas was filled with admiration and said: "My wise man."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What Su Ge just said is exactly the same as the truth of the incident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The analysis of these opportunities is only a few words of Vanas that seem to have nothing to do with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The thoughts of the gods are not something that I can wait for by ignorant people." Vanas now feels the power of the gods again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the mask, Su Ge’s mouth showed a smile, looked up at the night clock in the sky and asked: "In the report of Gerlos, did they succeed? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Failed, was stopped in time." Vanas said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it?" Su Ge’s eyes closed and seemed to have a feeling, leaving a meaningful word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas suddenly felt a shock in his heart, and there was a storm in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two words may contain huge changes that she can't imagine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And what?" After a few seconds of silence, Sug said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas converges and says: "Finally, the news came yesterday that the Brotherhood of the King of the Yellow Emperor suddenly disappeared."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Su Ge was a little surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How has the brotherhood of the King of the Yellow King, who has been very strong recently, suddenly disappear? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if the church is annihilated in March, it is impossible to completely annihilate such an ancient cult in such a short period of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas went on to say: "According to the information brought back by Luke, the way these people died was similar to the disappearance of the sacrifice failure. Many people have lost. For the memory of the Brotherhood of the Yellow King, only some mysterious people with certain strength still remember."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This suddenly made Su Ge think of before in Bain In the city, the nature of the two are killed by the evil spirits of the black blood and the evil spirits of the stars. The nature of the two is the same (see chapter 0325 for details). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, Su Ge thought of the truth of this incident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go on," Su Ge said calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas respectfully bowed and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This article Su Ge asked: "How is Ace?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A black The shadow appeared, and Shure was on the main hall: "My Lord, Ace's growth is very smooth, and now it has accumulated about 80% of the essence. Even if you don't have to accumulate it, you can come from the container according to your order." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Continue to shelter all believers and take direct action when necessary." Su Ge finished, the body turned into a mist disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shuer turned into a black shadow, followed by the fog of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going to the top of the Kingdom of God again, here is the border of dreams, on the other side of the border, is a broken world - a dreamland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Place your hand on this border again, this time completely different from the previous one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last time he passed this touch, he gave the body the power to die, thus solving the problem of Vanas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, he is using this broken world as a medium to perceive the changes in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s similar to my guess. Although the cultists did not incite the rules and origins of the world, they used their own lives to pollute the source. The goddess of March The ancient rules that have come down are no longer pure.” Su Ge’s eyes are full of light, and he can foresee that with this incident as a node, the world is about to undergo earth-shaking changes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As for the disappearance of the King of the Yellow Brothers, they were given one by their Lord." Suge's mouth was full of irony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Normalization is a way of sacrifice in occult, and it is also the most vicious and taboo way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general way of normalization is used in the inheritance and sacrifice of the family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, someone wants to resurrect an ancestor who has died. Because the cost of reversing life and death is too great, a lot of strong homologous sacrifices are needed. Use normalization. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through a relationship, across the space, everyone who is connected through such a relationship is treated as a sacrifice, that is, all things are one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more common is the bloodline. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let all the people on a bloodline become a sacrifice for a certain person and return to his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the disappearance of the Brotherhood of the King of the Yellow Emperor is also one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key to their reunification is: faith. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be a sacrifice for all who believe in the king of yellow clothes, to complete a certain ritual across space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only one that can perform this kind of horror ritual and power is the king of yellow clothes itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, with the disappearance of the Brotherhood of the King of the Yellow Emperor, the king of the Yellow Emperor has already finished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't expect the loopholes generated by the cultists to be used so quickly. However, even if there are rules of slanders and filth, it is still very demanding to descend. To complete the advent, you must have enough sacrifices, a strong enough core, and a strong enough container and medium."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
