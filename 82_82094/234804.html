			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge chose to be the first to go out after believing in Luke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adeline turned to look at Luke and Verginia, who had been sitting on the side and said nothing, "What are your plans?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luke smiled and took the badge and mask and said, "I am the person of your late church today."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Vignia stood up and stared at the big sword with a very dignified expression: "I don't care who he is, I dare to make such unforgivable things, I will not let him go!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you finish, take your helmet and go out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has no interest in joining any church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Teacher, do you need me to go?" Roland walked out of the back room and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A month ago, after being taken away by Luke, he became Luke’s only apprentice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luke took the mask and thought about it: "Go, go together. Just send you to the library, it's safe."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, the group went out of the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The streets in the weekdays are no longer able to see the harmony and tranquility of the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looked at the body of the huge worm in the distance, looked at the destroyed street lamps and the ground on both sides, and couldn’t help but think of the winter in the sky, the sky was floating Snowflake, he walks alone in the quiet night, warm and bright street lights reflect the falling snow, enjoy this kind of quiet and warm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, everything is quiet, all the warmth has ceased to exist with the distant winter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Su Ge is even more angry and even hateful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is like a child’s favorite toy being ruined by rudeness. At this time, Su Ge wants to kill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where are we going next?" Adellin asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug returned to God and spit out a breath: "Go to Avon's home."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp His hair is small, and Evan’s home is not far from here. This time he came out with two purposes. The first one should save himself and the people with good relationships as much as possible, and then save other people to expand his popularity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His friends are not many, Evans, Jack, Ossen. Roland is around, just need to save the three, he can let go and save others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The group quickly followed the street to the home of Evan, who was less than 500 meters from the Su Ge family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Evan’s door was locked and the curtains did not come, as if no one was there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bells in Su Ge’s mind screamed and spread out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, four fuzzy ripples are presented in his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately! Fortunately!" Su Ge feels that the situation of four people is very stable. He hurriedly knocked on the door and changed his voice: "I Yes... I am a church member. The situation is very dangerous now. If anyone is there, I will hurry up. I will escort you to the Church of the Holy Blood for shelter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp When I heard Su Ge’s words, a messy footstep sounded in the locked door, and then a blond middle-aged man carefully opened the door and looked at the masked Su Ge cautiously asked: “You really "People in the church?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly: "We belong to the church of the late bell. Now the church has decayed in March, this time it is Ron. If the bishop is concerned, please leave with us quickly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun is about to go down, Su Ge doesn't have much time to waste, and when using it, he uses the meditation and hypnosis directly. Evan’s father nodded and opened the door,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;& Nbsp; Su Ge quickly ran in and tore a torn old clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing!?" Evan was dignified at the moment, holding a kitchen knife in his hand and Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the brave Evan, Su Ge was happy from the heart, and then did not say much, directly directly hypnotized him with his mother and sister Betty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use the cloth to cover the eyes of four people, make sure they can't see the bugs, pick up four people and turn around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next destination for everyone is the Church of the Holy Blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After crossing a large pit, he took the deserted carriage on the side of the road and quickly rushed to the north gate of the Cathedral of the Holy Blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luke whispered: "The material laws of this region are gradually breaking down. The average person can see the giant worms. This can be proved. In the place, the rule of the "Ignorant is fearless" made by the goddess of March has lost its effect. If this continues, the material law of this space will be completely ineffective, and as a result, those who cannot come to the material world can come directly to Here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Aideline’s face is extremely dignified, what those things represent, she is not very clear, but she is clear that the advent Things will have a huge impact on the whole world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug is very calm at this time, faintly responding: "This is not a bad thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "What do you mean?" Luke was very surprised by the calmness of Su Ge at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s mouth tilted slightly, with an indescribable indifference in his eyes: “The bondage of the law of loss of material is relative, I can feel it. When the machine is mature, you may not face the despair of the end, but the hope of redemption."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pump! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Adeline, Hills, and Bernice’s heart slammed, and suddenly thought of a possibility. Luke noticed the changes of the three people, turned his head and stared at Su Ge’s contemplation for a moment, and randomly thought: “Is it...”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About ten minutes later, the group came to the north gate of the Church of the Holy Blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Luke’s leadership, everyone sneaked into the Church of the Holy Blood with a very strange route, and turned from a side door Came to the library of the Church of the Holy Blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You go in, I am waiting outside." Luke seems to have deep jealousy about this library. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time is tight, everyone does not say anything, go straight in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a group of people walked into the library, they felt an indescribable terrorist power coming to their bodies, and at this moment they found their own All mysterious forces are completely imprisoned, and there is an invisible force hanging over their heads, telling them all the time, if there is a slight change, they will die! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lot of people in the library at this time, and a lot of church staff and some clergy are here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug saw Ivan, saw Father Anthony, saw Father Harden, saw Sister Marlene, and Father Hank, Sister Julie . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Su Ge came in, everyone looked down on four people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who are you? How come in from here?" Father Anthony asked with a dignified face, his hand slowly reaching behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge adjusted the voice and made a deep voice: "Don’t be excited, we belong to the church of the late bell, and there is nothing malicious. This is what I saved. The civilians, I heard that it was safe to send them over."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mermaine slowly came over and carefully took over four people from Evan, sure that there was no After the problem, he secretly sighed and immediately asked: "What purpose do you have?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing, just seeing this behavior." Su Ge said Finish, turn and go out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not invite them to go out together because it was absolutely safe and he was very suspicious. Even if it doesn't work, who knows if these guys with masks want to take them out and kill themselves? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
