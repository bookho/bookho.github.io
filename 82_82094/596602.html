			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three were seated, and Su Ge asked calmly: "What about the statue?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Duke waved at the side of the bodyguard, and the bodyguard went to a room next to it, taking less than a minute to get a fist-sized statue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statue seems to be carved from ancient bluestone, the whole body is turbid green, the dust and dirt on it have been wiped clean, even if the gap is spotless, enough to see Duke's fancy for this statue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statue looks like a monster with a huge octopus head, similar to the human body, and the wings of a pair of bats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statue's technique is not very clever, and the overall line of the statue is very rough and simple, just like the rudiment just polished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this statue gives Suger a moment of instant, and it feels an indescribable horror mystery and creates an uncontrollable fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The violent rough tentacles on the octopus's head are scattered, there is an indescribable distortion and ugliness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The octopus head with a deformed shape after the tentacle is like a shape that does not belong to this world, and it is faintly sensible to the kind of water that is constantly squirming and flowing under the flesh. Like a pustule, like a herpes, like a pus wound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"嘶嘶嘶!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge suddenly returned to God, sucking in a cold breath, Some of my face is not very good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl faced the suspicious performance of Su Ge at this time, looking down at his nails. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug does not dare to continue to look at the deformed head with his eyes,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his vision today It has reached 55 points, which has already belonged to a relatively high value in humans. He is afraid that his own vision will allow him to see what he should not see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes fell on the body of the statue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with the skull's head, the statue's body has a strange and flat, seemingly meditation, legs crossed, hands with a kind of Su Ge do not understand The fuzzy gesture is placed on the lower abdomen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wings behind it are attached to the sides of the body, like an eggshell, holding it in the middle, as if protecting his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes returned from the statue, Duke said seriously: "You should also be able to feel the difference in this statue? According to my estimation, this statue At least 3,000 years of history, although the hand is relatively rough, but the image of a certain island country placed on the bow of the ship, has a huge research value and historical significance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Su Ge's face was calm, with a dignified tone in his tone: "Mr. Steven, your housekeeper, have you ever had contact with this statue for a long time? Or have you been alone?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke heard the tone of Su Ge, his face was a little dignified, then he thought about it and then nodded and said: "The statue was kept by him before. The thief had already got the statue yesterday. Then he was robbed back, it seems...he was holding the statue while he was out in the rain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Su Ge said directly: "There is nothing wrong with this statue. It is no accident. It should be a certain one. Teach used utensils, even statues of some evil spirits."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The statue of the evil spirit!?" When I heard this, Duketon was very pale. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug Finger pointed at the vague traces above: "From this trace, it can be seen that the craftsman who carved the statue is a very brilliant The craftsman, he should have made this statue come alive, but why does this statue become this look?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke shook his head and said he didn't know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge seriously said: "Because, the gods are not directly visible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen At this point, Duke suddenly remembered this ancient law, mortals can not look directly at the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge looked at the statue and said: "The craftsman should also be a cult. He longs for others to see his own Lord, but if the carving is too realistic, the people who see it will go crazy, and the statue will not be the will of the world. "Allowed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, he deliberately carved the statue into this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to Su Ge, Duke carefully looked at the subtle nicks, his face was paler and his voice was a little trembling. "Mr. Black Mist, then... what should I do now? I should not be evil." Look at it!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you usually say this to him, he will think that the guy is the liar who wants this statue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now it’s different, he knows his steward, how sensible and determined, this wise man suddenly goes crazy, this is incredible It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adding to the crazy gestures and sinful eyes of his own person before, suddenly made him even more afraid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge touched his chin and looked at the statue. He clearly recognized it. This statue is a statue of Cthulhu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was not thinking about the true and false of this statue at this time, but why the statue appeared in Duke’s hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Duke fell into fear, Su Ge suddenly asked: "How did you bring this statue in? I remember this level of cruise, for guests The carry-on should have very strict control? Any suspicious things are not allowed to be brought up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke returned to God and said: "This thing is more precious. I was personally carrying it at the time. And our family's reputation is very good, so we can take a special passage and check it is relatively loose."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suggton thinks A possibility, continue to ask: "Which day was this statue brought to you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It was the day before the ship, the next day We are going to leave the Ocean City, and we have temporarily changed the way we encountered that kind of thing," Duke said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge has roughly understood some situations and is immersed in contemplation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This made Duke even more uneasy: "Mr. Black Mist, did you think of something?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Su Ge returned to God and nodded slightly. "According to my experience, you have been stared at by cults and become an accomplice to help them deliver goods. Even this statue is carefully designed for you to bring with you." The ship, after all, they are incapable of bringing this thing up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear this, Duke’s face is very ugly, and I think about the old man in my mind. The sailor, in terms of words and deeds, does not seem to be the kind of sailor who is destitute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn, I actually care about it." Duke said very ugly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge leaned on the sofa hill, did not speak, giving Duke plenty of time to think. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Silence for a dozen seconds, Duke whispered: "Can you find out which cult is using me?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge calmly replied: "This requires additional fees."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cost is not a problem, as long as you can guarantee me Personal safety, let me not suffer from the entanglement of evil spirits and the persecution of cults. After arriving safely in the family, you will get the most pure friendship of Duke Hausman." Duke was a little panicked at this time, but his tone was still quite good. Calm, clear words, both eyes and solemn, giving a very trustworthy look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Su Ge nodded and said, "I like people who are refreshed. How much is it? I don't guarantee the price. I believe you can give me a Satisfactory price tag."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke is in the color: "This is for sure."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge nodded, then looked at Duke's righteousness and asked: "Mr. Hausmann, do you trust me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke listened to silence for a few seconds, Truthfully: "Not very trustworthy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I appreciate your honesty. Because frankness is the first step in cooperation." Su Ge face Said with a thumbs up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke squeezed a smile: "Our family is based on honesty, and integrity is the norm of our family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge continues: "You should be able to feel To some, I am not an ordinary psychiatrist, and I have a certain relationship with the captain of this ship."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke recalls Su Ge Regarding the attitude of the proud captain, he said affirmatively: "Yes, I can feel it. If my estimate is not wrong, you should be a mysterious person."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two bodyguards were shocked when they heard this. They looked at Su Ge and gradually stretched out, and slowly stretched their hands to the lower back, carefully holding the weapons placed there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug hit a finger and nodded slightly: "Your feeling is not wrong. Since you can recognize us through the characteristics, you should have heard of it." Our reputation is that we can still live so many tombs, and we are not contaminated with any vicious curses and troubles. Our husband and wife naturally have strong enough means of self-protection."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Duke said seriously: "You are very honest and daring. You are the first person I have ever seen to be so openly acknowledging that I am a mysterious person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp Su Ge casually said: "Mystery is not a cultist. Although the church has been restricting the contact between the mysterious and ordinary people, there is not much difference between the mysterious and the ordinary. A gun pierces his head. And will die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard this, Duke had a relatively relaxed smile on his face, and he tempted: "What are your plans now?" Need my help?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded and said: "Captain Macock An upright soldier, who knew that there were cultists on the ship, invited me to help him to get rid of all the cults. Coincidentally..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Su Ge said, watching Duke with interest: "The thing in your hands is the statue of the evil spirits that the cultists believe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen At this point, Duketon's chills emerged from the soul and instantly spread to his whole body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
