			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the two people who were in meditation, Tess said with guilty conscience: "I don't know what this means, these are what they said to me. I was then I feel that they have some problems in thinking, and then they will not continue to ask."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Through Jean cursing the blood of the entire Guinness family, cursing the singer through this blood The land of the whole kingdom of Nice, and then the people cursing the people here, turned this into the hometown of the werewolf... so it’s not too expensive to get a werewolf..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge thought of this, suddenly thought of the talent of Vanas who can smell the death scent and the legend of the entire Guinness Kingdom being the home of the god of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it true that their werewolf is just a means, the real purpose is to see the corners of the power of the god of death?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tes is very limited to the average person. After Irina asked him some questions, the result was a question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air of Elena grabbed Suger’s cane again and stunned him directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next time is relatively calm, both seem to have their own minds, quiet thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After an hour, along with the cheers of the grooms, Su Ge turned back and looked around, only to find that they had entered the gate of the studio. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Does this need to be checked in the city?" Su Ge looked at the large city gate and asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illina shook her head and said: "The city is so big, if you want to go in, you can go in. It doesn't make sense to check here, as long as there is no large-scale The firearms weapons are good to carry, these things are very well checked."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded, through the window, I saw a lot of wearing Neat black uniforms, heavily armed soldiers, they looked alert and watched the six-way ear, but they didn't care much about the carriage in front of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After entering the city, Elena got up and picked up a headgear to cover Tes's head: "Let's go, we have returned to our own territory, and someone has responded. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge nodded, wearing a black hat and picking up his cane to go out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After bidding farewell to the groom, Su Ge took out the backpack hidden in the cargo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the finished Sug turned his head, he just saw Elena talking to a sturdy one-eyed soldier with a scorpion like a dead body. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the two people seem to be talking about Su Ge, the one-eyed soldier turned his head, with a serious guard, carefully and carefully a large circle of Su Ge. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After seeing Suge’s pale face, some wilting spirit, and a thin body, the inner alert was put down and nodded to Elena. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here Irina waved his hand at Su Ge to signal him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No wonder it can last for so long, it seems that Vanas is still a group of loyal and dedicated people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Su Ge thought about going over and taking off the hat standard saying: "Hello, sir."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After approaching, the officer felt that Su Ge was weak The atmosphere is more intense, turning to Elena and saying forcefully: "Look at him, if you have any questions, I will ask you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elena smiled and said: "Do not worry, Old Green!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is the deputy commander of Green!" The one-eyed officer whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking out, the relationship between the two is still very good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing after Su Ge, a bright black, four-wheeled carriage full of bullets stopped, two people drove a car and followed a pit The streets, bumpy to the palace located in the southeast of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the carriage, Elena said with a serious look: "You should feel honored and excited, because you are about to meet the most outstanding queen on the entire continent. Please show your highest respect, the highest number of gifts, the honour and the glory, to see the pearl of the entire northern kingdom."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Su Ge heard this, he suddenly remembered that when he and Vanas met last time, he said in his heart: "At that time, Vanas should have such a complicated mood!?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey! What are you thinking about? Have you remembered what I just said?" Elena raised her voice and reminded her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge returned with a smile and smiled: "I heard, the flower of Guinness, the pearl of the northern kingdom, the beauty of the Queen has been circulating in our northeastern province for a long time. I can see the Queen's deity this year, my heart is thirsty and I can't do it. I am a gentleman, can't show this kind of gaffe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Elena, who heard this, was very satisfied. She smiled and patted Suger’s shoulder and said, “Yes, I know that you are a good gentleman who knows how to be polite.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for the beautiful lady's compliment. So beautiful and powerful Elena, can you tell me your identity now?" Su Ge bowed down in her words and asked in a tone of respect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illina was very happy to hear, with a hint of pride on her face, said loudly: "Since you sincerely asked, it seems that your etiquette is in place. I will tell you on the face!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am a good sister of the Queen, and she is also a personal guard and aide, and she is also half her mysterious teacher. She has been protecting her for many years and educating her.” Speaking, Elena’s face was proud and proud, her hands were akimbo, and her chin was high and raised, like a peacock with high arrogance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge sighed in his heart: "No wonder Vanas is ignorant of mystery. It turns out that her teacher is you!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he knows the truth, Su Ge certainly won’t say it, especially at this time, Elena’s “Quickly praise me, let me flatter!” is written on my face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Su Ge is so closed, this witch with some fine attributes will definitely not finish with himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Su Ge slightly mobilized Randall’s practical and profound knowledge and said seriously: “No wonder the Queen can have such a strong will in adversity. It turns out that you have been helping her secretly! I can feel that for the Queen you are like her sister, guiding her, protecting her, acting as her sun, letting her see the beauty of hope, And while carrying the darkness alone, guarding her beauty and hope in the dark, you are just guarding the palace like a dragon guarding the northern continent, preventing those dark mysterious people from attacking the queen, you are like the light of the western continent. ............"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
