			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soft-lighted gas light illuminates the restaurant, and the four people around the table are in the middle of the table. The middle is tender and tender, golden and exudes spices and meat. Fish, four pairs of eyes are shining with strange brilliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge took a deep breath and said, "Open and eat fish, be careful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Voice just Fall, Shirley was anxious to take an iron sign, will have two hand-sized grilled fish on the mouth, open a big mouth bite down, the delicious meat all bite down with the fishbone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嘎嘣嘎嘣, chew the fishbone directly in the mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge three people are very envious of Sherry's mouth, three people can not reach that level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the fishbone has been baked under the inspiration of Su Ge, it is very crisp, but some internal thorns still have the danger of the card owner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chewing of some charred fish in the mouth, combined with the aroma of spices, can be said to be the two generations of Su Ge, the best in decades of life I have eaten a fish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The process of eating is very cheerful and enjoyable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the problem of the teachings of the late church, there is no such thing as etiquette and dogma, and there is no need for so-called prayer and gratitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the doctrine clearly stipulates that the great master will only give the believer the life of the believer and the knowledge that can be self-reliant, and all other things are not given by the great master, It is the believer who gets it by his own efforts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All prayers The so-called rewards are false letters, the embarrassment of the great Lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the doctrine also clearly stipulates that there is no class in the Holy See, only respect and gratitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone can live and eat together unfettered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the noble Pope and a general communicator who has just joined the church are the same. All respect and admiration are placed in the heart, and actions are used to express their respect, not with mouth and etiquette. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the delicious dinner, there was only a pile of fish bones on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, Shirley’s three fish bones were not, and all of them were chewed and swallowed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a waste." Sherry, who was full of food, drank black tea and watched the fish bones on the table still not forgetting to ridicule. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the so-called lower creature, this waste is proof of your low form."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Bennis and Betty did not follow up after listening to the smile, and asked directly: "You are going to rest, let's give it to us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Shirley nodded with satisfaction and turned and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge followed and stood up and said, "Thank you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't say thank you, Holding the bell man. This is how we express respect for you.” Betty smiled and said, like a lively and lovely squirrel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;British smiled and said: "You have given us a lot, this is what we should do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge saw the two people implement the doctrine, and nodded with satisfaction and walked out of the restaurant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the living room, just seeing Shirley wearing a cute plush pajamas lying on the bed, the white palms slightly touched the stomach, and the face was satisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge gently walked over and sat next to her and asked, "Where are you going tomorrow?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Go and see the blood bar." Shirley closed her eyes and followed the feeling to the top, snuggling in Su Ge's arms, thick black hair licked the chest of Su Ge, like a bird in the nest Look for a comfortable location. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge reached out and touched her soft black hair, and the expression was full of peace and happiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The days of these two days made him feel very happy and happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After every day, I buy food and cook together. After dinner, I lie on the warm sofa, talk about the trifles that happen in the day, and then sleep and sleep. The dull happiness even made Su Ge obsessed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warm atmosphere is fascinating, but it is a bit short. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soft moonlight shines from the window to the ground, and there is a faint mysterious wave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug holds Shirley and puts her on the couch and says, "I will go out and come back later."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shelly was somewhat unwilling, raising her hand like a wavy darkness from her white palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Better not, I guess there are other clerics who secretly observe." Su Ge’s voice was calm and wisely blocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley didn’t say much, he waved back the darkness and lay on the sofa lazily: “Go, come back soon.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded, didn’t change clothes, wore the gray plush pajamas with the same version of Shirley and walked out the door. When they went out, the two people in the kitchen: “Just do it” Nothing happened."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good!" The two answered casually and continued their work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wearing the slippers, Suge walked out of the house and looked around the darkness, followed by a faint flute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard the sound of the flute, Su Ge had a feeling of slight dizziness, and then the night of the soul resounded, dispelling all spiritual illusions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately after the night, Yu Bo spreads out and found a mysterious man with a flute hidden in the grass on the left side of the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corner of Su Ge’s mouth was a little smirk, and when he was preparing to shoot, he looked awkwardly, then stood there motionless and seemed to be waiting for something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time passed slowly, and the mysterious person in the grass saw Su Ge motionless and thought that Su Ge had fallen into illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a slow rush of grass coming out of the Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he was less than three meters away from Su Ge, a brilliant purple light flashed past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug saw that the eyes were slightly enlarged, because this beautiful purple light is a real sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a sword with a full moon-shaped crescent shape, comparable to the crescent moon in Su Ge’s memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This purple sword is so sudden and fast, the mysterious person was hit without any notice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After being hit by the purple sword, the mysterious person did not have any wounds, but he did not move on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge is a little shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he discovered that the soul of this mysterious person was broken! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the soul is completely broken, as if it were a porcelain, fragmented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This horrific mysterious attack made Suge shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lazy voice came from the night: "I plan to let you shoot, try your bottom, but I changed my mind."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looked down at the sound, just to see Father Sini walking down the streetlight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing him, Su Ge’s eyes tightened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, Father Sini’s murky eyes are filled with crystal clear purple light, exuding a beautiful and deep light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his hand, holding the worn sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hilt is still so worn, but the blade has turned into a one-meter-long light purple sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
