			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, Su Ge got up early and began to take care of himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finish the hair, shave the beard, iron the clothes neatly, and wipe the shoes clean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he was still sleepy, Black found that his brother was ready to go out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The rice is on the table, wash your face and grab it." Su Ge took some worn-out black leather gloves and picked up his cane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black rubbed his eyes and looked at his neat, energetic brother, and said loudly: "May the goddess of March bless you! My brother!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug said with a smile: "You forgot to salute."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oops!" Black listened to the hurriedly put his left hand on his forehead and added etiquette. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weather is good today, the heavy snow yesterday will have cleared the sky for a few days. The sky seemed like a child who was full of grievances. After a burst of tears, she recovered a bright smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At 7:45 in the morning, Su Ge came to the police station. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female police officer in charge of reception at the front desk seems to have already had an order, and smiled and said: "Going in from the left corridor, the fifth door on the right hand side, the master is waiting for you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug said with a smile: "Thank you, beautiful lady, I hope that you will be as beautiful as you are today."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approximately 35-year-old female police officer heard a happy smile: "It’s a polite gentleman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Follow the corridor and come to the door, Su Ge gently knocked on the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come in!" Gerlos's unique hoarse voice came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug took off his hat and bowed openly and walked in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a temporary office was small, and there were a lot of documents and files on the huge desk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warren sat on the sidelines and looked at the document seriously, while Orson and Gerlos sat and looked at each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master Gerlos, Deputy Minister." Su Ge was slightly covered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerlos nodded and asked, "Thinking?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge walks over Said: "Well, I am joining."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ossen stood up and patted Suger’s shoulder and said, "Welcome to join, Mr. Sotos." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, he went out. He is not a member of the church, or it is better to avoid it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sit!" Gerlos pointed to the chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Sug sat down, Gerlos picked up a file and said, "Your intelligence is very important. We caught a total of 32 deaths last night. The core members of the church, seventy-four believers, including the police, parliamentarians, wealthy businessmen, and even the deputy mayor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard this Su Ge look surprised: "Deputy mayor!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a bit more involved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerousus does not seem to be keeping secrets. He continues: "The roots of this organization need to be deeper than expected. They react very quickly, and now there are still some The believers are at large, including your former mentor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sud, Su Ge was sinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That guy is a huge hidden danger for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerousus took out a contract-like thing and said, "If you agree, sign the contract and press your own blood on it." Handprint."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug took over the contract and looked carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are not many contracts, there are only four pages in total, and there are not many terms. It was mainly what Jackos said before, protecting the secrets of the church, obeying orders, not moving around, not being able to use power for personal gain, to be loyal to the people, to be loyal to the church, and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The content is detailed and there is no ambiguity. After that, Su Ge put his eyes on the material of the contract. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This paper is not ordinary paper, it feels more like the skin of some animals, and the text is surrounded by borders with inscriptions and patterns, like some weird The spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerlos explained: "At this time, the sheepskin contract paper, and the four dominating forces of the servants, lawyers, judges, and priests at the level of the church dominator If you sign up with your own blood, you must follow it. If you find that you have betrayed or abnormal behavior, we can not only find you through this contract, but even curse you directly through the contract, and bind you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嘶嘶嘶! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugarton took a breath of air, this kind of contract is a bit scary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss said faintly: "Faith, affection, love and the like are not reliable, only absolute control can get absolute sincerity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge heard the heart and muttered: "The style of your hunter is also very good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the demon hunters belong to the church, they do not have any beliefs and have no feelings for the church. Because they are a group of killing machines without any feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss continues: "The effect of this contract is five years. If you don't want to continue after five years, you can sign another confidentiality contract and get free. Body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge tightened the contract somewhat hesitant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s very inefficient to force others to do things now. There is only one thing in my life that will force others, and everything else will go with the flow." Jeros said slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Su Ge was a bit curious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerous's golden erect with inhuman indifference: "Forced him to die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug hurriedly left his eyes and looked at the strange In the eyes, Su Ge feels that his back is cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking down again and carefully looking at the contract, I found that there is no similarity to the main god contract, and after doing the thing that should not be done, the effect of direct death, Su Ge Bite your fingers and drop the blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can only fight for time through this. Until the future, as long as the secrets are resolved, I can get out of this contract." Su Ge’s heart think. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After dropping the blood and pressing the fingerprint, Su Ge took the quill and wrote his name on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, Su Ge saw that the inscriptions and lines around the contract seemed to be alive, and turned into countless thorns to extend his name and blood. live. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know if it’s an illusion, a feeling of a thorn in the back flashed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collecting the contract, Gerlos’s words turned and he calmly said: “You can rest assured that the church has grown more than 10,000 years now. We want to let humans come. The better, not the people who are our slaves. As long as you are loyal enough, this contract will have no side effects and even some benefits for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Benefits!?" Su Ge stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the benefit of his mother’s vicious contract! ? Su Ge’s heart spit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerousus said faintly: "Mystery is mysterious because it cannot explain them with science and common sense. I said that this contract is dominated by The diviners, lawyers, judges, and priests of the level are made in large quantities, but there are still subtle forces that cannot be described by common sense and language. If you choose your own career, follow your own knowledge. With the improvement of vision and vision, you can find some valuable knowledge for you through this contract."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dominator!" Only noticed this vocabulary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
