			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Su Ge’s inquisitive question, Vanas did not dare to neglect, frowning and contemplating, searching all his memories accurately and efficiently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug sat across from her, waiting quietly. About ten minutes later, Vanas looked up with some uncertainty and said, "I remembered that when I was a child, I occasionally listened to some words that my father said. Allusions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Talk about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas sorts out the thoughts: "Compare Fragmentation, I sorted it out into three parts. The first part is that I occasionally heard what my father and my grandfather said, saying that after we came here, it caused a lot of killings, which led us to anger the gods here, our people. After being cursed, the tribes withered, and the inheritance gradually severed. After what seems to have passed, my ancestors made sacrifices and became a condition with a god, so that we can survive and multiply here." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The second part is that our royal temple is built around a well. I was curious to ask why I should surround this well. My father explained that the well symbolizes the will of the land and builds a temple around the well. When we arrived at the sanctuary of the land, let our royal family prosper forever."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The third is a rather weird situation."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know why, the first child of each generation of our family will die because of unknown circumstances, live after birth. But for two months. The same is true for my generation. Strictly speaking, I am not an eldest daughter. I have a sister who was born a year earlier than me but died."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard these three clues, Su Ge asked: "Do you know some things about Mila?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas shook his head "I don't know too well, you can ask him. With your current status and status, he should be able to tell you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded After bidding farewell to Vanas, he quickly found the mil who was still interrogating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard the meaning of Su Ge, I could see the mil face with sinking, and some struggles in my eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge seriously warned: "Master, you have to think about the relationship between them and want to completely break the game. I have to know the details here." Now even our enemies know more about the royal family than I do. How do you protect me?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, Mill sighed and said "Okay, the situation is urgent, I will tell you about the oath for the time being."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that, Mill took Su Ge back to his study, then from one Three very shabby khaki books were taken in the hidden secret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a story about curses and children." Mill said to sit down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge gathers the spirit and listens carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The source of the matter is on the ancestors of the Guinness family. They were the most elite expeditionary corps of the Church of the Holy Blood, specializing in long-distance attacks and annihilating the rebellion. There was a major plague in Nice, which led to the rapid growth of cults, and the prototype of this cult is now the death sect."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fighting to attack the cult The Guinness Legion completely annihilated the death sect, killing 30,000 people at that stop. You should know that in mystery, there are many people who die a lot more trouble than those who are alive."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is a good nod, although he has not experienced it, only heard of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are too many murderers who are infected with the breath of the dead, and the soul of 30,000 people cursed their entire family." Mill said with dignity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge brows: "Curse this thing really exists? I feel this is too illusory."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The curse involves too many things, not that you can explain it now. But I can tell you clearly that the curse is the most difficult and horrible thing in the whole mystery. Don't touch too much." Mill cautioned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge nodded: "Well, you continue."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mill continues: "The curse of 30,000 people brings the breath of the dead into their bodies, the entire legion Everyone, the body began to rot, gradually turned from human to undead monster."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a bit awkward!" Su Ge jumped in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After that, the leader of the legion quickly asked for help from the Church of the Holy Blood. The church attaches great importance to it. According to the record, the pope, the saint, the saints of the stars "Come on."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This seems to be quite wrong with Vanas." In Su Ge’s memory, Vanas said that the Guinness family was sanctified. The blood church abandoned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mill faintly said: "Listen to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The curse is very horrible And it has been completed and is irreversible. The high-level church of the Holy Blood thought of many methods, and finally, inadvertently, they came into contact with a will, a will beyond the ordinary form."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God of Death!?" Su Ge eyes a glimpse. Mir nodded: "Yes, He made a request, and as long as he meets the requirements, He can heal the curse of Guinness."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What requirements?" Su Ge was nervous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The god of death desires his own children. He asks the Guinness family to serve Him forever, and to plant part of his strength, eager to pass the Guinness family. People born their own children."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Children? The god of death actually wants their own children!?" Su Ge’s eyes widened, indicating that it was unclear. Mill sighed: "The existence of that level, thinking is not something you and I can consider. But when it comes to this extravagant, the evolution of mysterious forms." How much do you know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The evolution of the mysterious form? I haven't heard of it." Sug simply shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
