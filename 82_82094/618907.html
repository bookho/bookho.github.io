			<div id="content"><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a brief understanding of the mysterious situation of the glory city, Sergey asked: "How is the church now developing in the capital?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bennis smiled: "It’s very stable. I am currently responsible for the familiarity and enthusiasm of the middle and low-end aristocrats, and at the same time docking the Grasse family. The teacher is mainly responsible. "High-end aristocratic intersection."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge listened with a relaxed expression: "The tulip of the tulip, this name seems to be famous in the emperor."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis of the Tulip is the name of Adeline who is now in the Imperial City. She is now a red man next to Revedin III. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it has just been promoted to the Marquis for more than a year, its beauty and wisdom are well known in the city of Hui Yao and even the entire empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bennis smiled: "To be honest, I don't know what is going on now, and the teacher suddenly became the daughter of the old tulip." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The title of the Marquis represents the true high of the empire, the core of rights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green and Coase, the powerful general, is now only the title of the Marquis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did Aideline climb to this position, and Sugg was not sure about the details. But in the past, I heard a brief introduction to Vanas. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adeline uses her resources and means to let the old tulip, the son of the marquis who has no child, because of the young and playful, has Delin was an accidental product of a noble girl who raped a noble girl in the country by chance when she was young. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Adeline, who is old enough to be the mother of the old Marquis, became the only son of the old duke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This incident shocked a lot of people, including the church, and the Emperor had personally questioned and investigated the matter, but did not find any problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the already marvellous Marquis of the Tulip has hurriedly declared Adeline as his heir. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because according to national regulations, if the family does not have the legal heirs of the stipulations, the rest of the industry and wealth will be owned by the empire and the church. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old Marquis is an uncompromising waste, but let this inherit the family of hundreds of years, he still dare not do such a big deal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One month after Adeline became the heir, the old Marquis died of a systemic bacterial infection caused by kidney failure, leaving Adeline with a It is full of scars and mess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the entire aristocratic circle is ready to see how this mature, intellectual and sexy beauty works, Adele, who has been well educated since childhood (shown in the material) ) Showing their excellent education and talents, by continuously selling old assets, reorganizing existing assets, and completing the gambling agreement with the two investment companies, the tulip family that has been in decline for more than a decade is actually in a year. It has risen rapidly and has once again become a new star of the nobles of the imperial capital. At the same time, under the empire of the empire, Revodin III also noticed the outstanding talent of the female Marquis and personally ordered Adeline to be recruited into the cabinet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon, she showed her sharp talent for politics and finance as a legend, and she gave 15 rumors to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and these fifteen rumors make him very satisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few months later, this beautiful female marquis became a red man next to her knees, and there are even rumors that the tulip of the tulip is about to join the majesty of her majesty. The government has become a staff member who can influence the policy of imperial rule. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Adeline became the goddess of all aristocratic youth dreams, when people who pursue people can shoot hundreds of meters away, let everyone be the biggest The situation of falling glasses has appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know why, two months ago, the dream lover of countless men of this empire announced his fiancé. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerous Byron, the Archbishop of the Church of the Holy Blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If only the Archbishop is not a big problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this archbishop is a monster who has no feelings, a monster that is inhuman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this marriage, the entire empire was madly opposed, and those Adelin’s fanatic fans were even blocked at the door of the Tokachi Gate. After a week of continuous protests, even aristocratic circles issued strong protests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the four dukes of the emperor, no one is not eager to welcome this perfect woman into the house. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, in the face of such a terrifying protest, this time, neither the royal family nor the church did not waver, showing a resolute determination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is, all the talents know, this is another cold political marriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The church has suppressed the royal family for many years and has strong control over the royal family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tulip family is a family with no faith at all, and they are typical royalists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rapid rise of Adeline made the church a crisis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This marriage can be seen by everyone, is the absolute suppression of the royal family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it is such a perfect woman to marry a church monster without feelings, this is a real version of beauty and beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;British smiled and said: "You were not in the Imperial Capital. At that time, the whole emperor was called a mourning, all aristocratic single youth, single middle-aged face every day. It seems that the whole world owes him hundreds of thousands of francs. I can't help but laugh."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this Su Ge can't help but haha Laughing: "Ha ha ha, with Adeline's reputation and status at that time, higher than those of the top stars, can be called the national goddess, I heard Vanas said that she received the most, one day received more than a thousand love letters 40,000 flowers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes! It was spectacular at the time, but it also made the teacher annoyed, and there were many people with red eyes. Various means sneaked into the harassment." Benny said with a trace of remembrance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
