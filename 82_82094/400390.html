			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;March calendar October 15, 7845, the suburb of Bain City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a black suit, Sug, holding a silver-gray cane in his hand, stood on the edge of the official road of the west of the city, looking to the front of the wasteland full of wild grass, slightly lamented . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A year ago, he was thrown at the corpse, resurrected, met Luobo, and began a new life after his own trepidation. Br , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bishop, what acquaintances do you see?" Beside him, a young man in a gown wearing a gray cleric, looks like a young man in his early thirties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge smiled lightly and flexibly fiddled with the cane: "I haven’t come back for half a year, some touched the scene, remember that I found the secret of the death sect here, report it to Archbishop Gerlos, completely annihilated it from Bain City."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The youth was a little surprised and looked at the wilderness who was heading and sighed: "Great people, Often awakening one's character in a sudden choice. The bishop should have awakened his great character at that time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug did not answer, turned away I got on the carriage and asked: "The Archbishop should leave from Bain City and return to the capital?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You nodded and answered: "Yes, about a week later." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She also intends to continue to send people?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man shook his head, mouth corner With a smile, "No, we are the absolute confidant of the Archbishop."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge mouth slightly From: "Very good, your piety will win the approval of the Lord of Death and Storm, and his god will protect your beloved Archbishop."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your Kindness, His Majesty the Pope!" The youth was bowed and the name changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man is named Griffin Hoddy. The position is the deputy bishop, the expert-level priest, who was the leader of the monitoring team of ten people who was placed next to Su Ge two months ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He grew up in a church orphanage, and the young man was born, and was discovered by Emilia, who had followed Emilia for eleven years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Griffin is not only loyal to Emilia, but more obsessed and almost distorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the week after he came, he was induced by Cara’s strange powers to reveal the true thoughts and dark side of the heart, leading to the collapse of self-cognition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that, Su Ge stabilized his spirit through the night of the soul of the town, showing his strength while also pulling him into the kingdom of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he saw this, he knew that this power was not his own archbishop can be confronted and desperate. Then Su Ge gave him an analysis of the dangerous situation of Emilia today, and said that if he can give absolute loyalty to the Lord, he can promise Griffin, and then asylum to Amelia to ensure its absolute safety. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concern for Emilia has approached the distorted Griffin, and it is extremely ecstatic to accept this suggestion, officially becoming a loyal servant of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, his loyalty and enthusiasm for Emilia has not diminished, and all his purpose is for the safety and future of Emilia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this distorted form, he kept her away from the truth of terror in order to protect the safety of Emilia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Su Ge said, the church in the late bells can't let the Church of the Holy Blood know that if it is revealed, the Horror Knight of Death and Storm Lord will take everything away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few days, after constantly witnessing the powerful power of Sugera, he completely surrendered and rebelled against the remaining nine people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then Su Ge found that I don’t know if Emilia deliberately did it, and all of her core confidants had her almost fanatical loyalty and distortion. Love. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of mood can guarantee enough loyalty, but the distorted love has become an important breakthrough for Su Ge to control them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Emilia, they can give everything, even their own soul, even if they are in hell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two sat back in the carriage, and Su Ge took off his hat and looked at the carriage coming and going out of the window: "The Archbishop is the apostle of God who really thinks for the people, Bain City. After half a year, I was really rich."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Gryffindon was very happy and grateful: "Thank you for your approval, kneel down."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before you call the bishop." Su Ge waved his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Bishop."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is the Bishop of Bain now?" Looking up at the urban area that is approaching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Griffin replied: "It’s the archbishop’s younger brother. I just came out of the Stars Court this year and called Nel Euler. I will call you back this time. The main purpose is to let you see him. After all, Bain City is next to Guinness. In the future, you and the two will have a lot of mutual support."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su The grid nodded slightly and closed his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Five days ago, Su Ge, who had become the bishop for half a year, finally completely processed the entire Guinness city, that is, the late bell, from the beginning to the end. I was going to sneak out and stroll, but suddenly I received a command from Emilia to return to Bain City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the order is a bit sudden, Su Ge is still very happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, their core family business, including Luobo, Ivan and others are still in Bain City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time through Griffin’s mouth, Su Ge knows that Emilia is very satisfied with Su Ge’s performance in the past six months, and this time he also approved All the people he wanted were transferred to Guinness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this half-year full-scale secret review, Emilia is completely reassured about Su Ge, as long as she has her own people, she is not afraid, Do not mind Suge’s party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is very clear about the atmosphere of the Holy See. It is impossible for all the bishops to have a group of their own loyalists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is very happy to see this, after all, she is in the capital, she can not let every bottom person loyal to herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let these people be loyal to Su Ge, she indirectly controls these people through Su Ge, this is the perfect structure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, the core credit of this is the secret of Griffin’s ten people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge has become the same loyal as theirs in their mouths. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This return is not official, so it is not high-profile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge didn’t even bring too many people, Griffin, Prince Jean, and three powerful Werewolf soldiers, a total of two carriages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The safety issue on the road Su Ge does not worry at all, with his current ability, as long as those robbers dare to come, Su Ge is very happy to perform physical super-degree on them! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way it came is very calm, and even makes Su Ge feel a bit lonely and a pity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the road from the northwest side of the road into Bain City, Su Ge found through the window that the old houses that were seriously damaged in the suburbs have been rebuilt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The street was refurbished and the area of ​​the city expanded outward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The previously derelict suburban home has been rebuilt and refurbished and has become a new urban area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More vendors are radiating from the city centre, as Emilia said, she did bring a new dimension to Bain. brilliant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "According to this speed, in a few years, it can indeed develop into a first-tier city." Su Ge said through the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Griffin’s face with a sigh of pride: “The Archbishop has always been a must.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"Parking, it doesn't seem to be a hurry to come back this time, my home is nearby, I will go down and see." Su Ge saw a familiar street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage stopped immediately, and Prince Jean, who had been quiet all the time, asked: "Do you need a guard?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Sug took the cane and got off the bus: "No, you should go to the Cathedral of the Holy Blood first!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people are very aware of the bishop’s Character, did not say more to stop, wait for Su Ge to continue to move after getting off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing on the streets where people come and go, Su Ge looks at the shops along the street, selling fruits, selling meat, selling clothes, selling spices. Wait, the corner of the mouth reveals a reminiscing smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Remember that there was only one meat and a grocery store before." Su Ge often bought bones for Lobo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind the street to the front of your home: "The entire place has been demolished, how is my demolition? Is it a set?" New house, still give me money?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going along the road ahead, I saw that the houses on both sides were rebuilt and even part of the structure of the street. All have changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge was crumbling and found himself walking around a dead end and getting lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slightly lifted the hat, Su Ge looked up at the four-meter-high wall in front of him: "This is a bit embarrassing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey! Who are you!" At this moment, a cautious voice came from behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge heard the sound and saw a young policeman wearing a black police uniform with a black fur hat and a young face staring at himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man is now at the waist, his body is tight, and he seems to be very alert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s eyes looked at the youth, which suddenly made the youth more nervous. The pistol that pulled out the waist directly whispered, “Don’t move!”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
