			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attack is still going on, the bodies around have been piled up to four or five meters high, and two people are sitting in the middle, as if sitting in a deep well where the bodies are piled up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turned to look at Andrew next to him, his voice still sounds, it seems that he did not wake up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looked at the monster that was approaching again, took out the shark potion, and frowned and thought about whether to use the potion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using a potion can give yourself a new level of energy, but the effect is only half an hour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half an hour, not only will psionics be completely deficient, but even bodily functions will be severely exhausted due to the potion load. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, there is no difference between entering the exhausted state and waiting for death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s still too small to watch this ongoing battle. I thought I could stick to the dark. Now it seems that this is my limit." Su Ge said Turn and turn to prepare to wake Andrew. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a deadly fight, there is no need to use the potion as a killer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Andrew’s snoring stopped, and then there was no sleepy sound: “What is the potion in your hand?”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well." Su Ge nodded and put the potion away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, two monsters in the sky suddenly jumped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shoulder gun on Andrew’s shoulders went up, and two warm white shells fired out, directly flying two monsters out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrew clenched his sword in his hand and he felt he had fully recovered to his peak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether it’s spiritual or physical, it’s even better than when you’ve just entered the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you." Andrew said as he stood up and looked at the walls of the bodies that were stacked three or four meters. He said with a thumbs up: "After a little training." You will become a good wolf warrior."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge’s face was a little pale at this time, and his legs were on the plate: “The next step is for you, I need to meditate for a while.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Reassured.” Andrew Said, the whole body flashed warm white light, then the whole person skyrocketed, like a rocket rising from the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge safely closes his eyes and quickly restores psionics through deep meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Su Ge returned to God, the psionics had recovered Sixty percent, the sky is completely dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Slowly stand up and move your body, and the clothes soaked with blood are stuck on your body, and Sug is very uncomfortable and irritating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wake up!?" At this moment, Andrew stood in the upper tone and asked softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded and stretched out and said, "Be careful, I will push these bodies down."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thorn ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Blood splatters, Andrew pulled out a monster's spine bones in one hand: "OK!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Suge took a deep breath, hehe...hey...hey! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three slow and slow bells gradually spread out, and the surrounding conditions were resolved by subtle vibrations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, Su Ge’s hands clasped together and the whole body began to violently shake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strong vibrations begin to induce high-speed vibration of the surrounding air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Su Gewan entered into a completely high-dimensional world, his body, his body is full of ambiguity, as unreal as fantasy . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The first is the conduction of vibration, bringing all the matter into this amplitude. Then the resonance of the bell and the vibration acts on the air around me, the air in the gap and all the matter. The ripples are released continuously, and this kinetic energy is in one The violent savings in the range, followed by an instant detonation!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s mind is spinning fast, and this complex process is constructed in an instant, with its own body as the medium and source. Su Ge shouted and a huge amount of spirits poured out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗡嗡嗡...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a flight of planes, driving all the glass in a building Vibrating, an indescribable terrorist force erupted instantly in the gaps of these bodies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up, Andrew, who has already felt something, suddenly surprised, his body suddenly jumped up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a gust of wind blowing, thousands of corpses stacked on top of it suddenly blasted from the middle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The countless bodies, stumps, and minced meat are flying out in all directions as if they were ejected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Invisible forces cleaned up all the bodies on this platform in almost two seconds, the platform was neat and clean, and even the accumulated blood was swept away. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge spit out a sigh of relief and could see a light white steam on his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is because of the high level of vibration that generates heat and evaporates sweat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug is a bit tired, because the psionics that have just recovered 60% are consumed in half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he is very cool. Just this time, the practice and principles of the analysis of these days and their own bodies have been fully integrated, resulting in this missile-like terrorist explosive force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An incomparably transparent, uncomfortable feeling filled in his spirit, thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, he felt that he had entered a new world. The things that were cumbersome and boring were as good as instinct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the instinct of the underworld, he knows that he has entered a new realm, a new level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This realm is called the master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Master-level night bells, reach! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrew came over and looked at Sugg’s state at this time and smiled and said, “Congratulations.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sugg smiled back and smiled: "Thank you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you feel?" Andrew asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge touched his chin and said, "It’s cool, very cool, and it has a refreshing feeling and a sense of freedom. It’s like a piece. The fish entered a wide lake from the small water tank and was free and refreshed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrew nodded: "Master is an important threshold. There are many Things can only be understood when they reach the master level, and the moment they enter, it is endless."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge looked up at the three in the sky When the moon and the stars of the sky retracted their sights, more monsters rushed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle is still going on, and it seems that there is never a possibility of ending. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I should go back," said Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrew’s lightly waving broad-handed sword said: “Well, you don’t belong here.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I will be back, I hope that when you meet next time, you are not a body." Su Ge looked at him seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrew listened to his heart and shook a little, then smiled: "I will work hard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Su Ge nodded, accompanied by the injection of psionic energy, the cloak with blood on his back unfolded, and he flew out with Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This cloak is the holy grail document?" Andrew noticed the particularity of the cloak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sug Sotos, can you end this nightmare?" Andrew’s thoughts flashed and he continued to wave his hands steadily Great sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The state has been restored and he can continue to kill for another ten days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the roof back to the gate of the inner city, Su Ge looked back at the lonely wolf under the moon, turned and went out to close the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outer city is still so quiet and regular, it seems that there is no difference when he comes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monsters who lost their goals wandered around the streets like zombies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s body jumped lightly between houses with the help of a black cloak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he was halfway through, he suddenly felt something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body fell down a wall, slightly revealing the eyes, through the blurred window, you can see that a person in the house is killing silently with a knife. Your own companion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cruelly cut off the companion’s head and place it on a dressing table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a strange glow, the drawer under the dressing table opens, and the young man’s eyes sparkle with excitement, and both hands trembling to pick up the things inside. Mouth in his mouth: "Third-level secret treasure! Three-level secret treasure! I can use the three-level secret treasure!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge looked sideways and found him Holding a shabby music box in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a gimmick on the music box that is slowly turning, and the hollow light shimmers in the hollow, exuding a mysterious atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This young man carefully closed the music box and put it in his arms and ran out excitedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the youth left, Suge rolled over and walked in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did not look at the poor pity that died, but looked at the dressing table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, the head on the dressing table has disappeared, I don’t know where to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several words on the mirror that is too vague. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Want to get the secret treasure? Then offer the head of your companion!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge I heard this in my heart, and I suddenly thought of a possibility in my mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, he heard a shrill scream in his ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instantly rushed out of the window and went straight to the four floors diagonally across the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is blood everywhere in this room, and there are two bodies on the side that are still trembling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scarlet floor absorbs the blood and gradually reveals a blood-red palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mysterious person who killed two companions on the side greedily picked up the palm and turned and ran. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bloody red palm is also a three-level secret treasure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s really a good idea," Su Ge sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city is eager to sacrifice, and the most effective way to sacrifice is to kill each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way to let outsiders kill each other is simple, to seduce with such a price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, after those who got the secret treasure escaped from the city, after their propaganda, more mysterious people will come here for the secret treasure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as more and more people, killing will be more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacrifices in the city will grow rapidly in a geometric way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge looked at everything in the city, even though he knew it clearly, but he did not stop it, nor intended to tell anyone, let this incident continue to be serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His purpose at this time is very clear, he is eager for the appearance of the Holy Grail of the soul, so he needs to let this sacrifice continue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night wind blows, letting the bloody smell of Su Ge drift away with the breeze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug stood on the wide wall and looked at the bloody and ugly things that happened in the city, calm and deep-eyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I thought you would stop it." A black wind blew, and the sexy and charming Shelly appeared not far from him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger has now entered the master class, and his inner stability has been improved. He controls his own impulse to turn his head and look at the past. He said calmly: " I am very curious, how many secret treasures have you invested in, and how should those secret treasures be recovered?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you really think that it is a secret treasure?" Shirley is seductive The voice carries some insidious and malicious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s heart is cold, silent for a few seconds: “Good means!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the end, the cloak hunted and danced, and Su Ge leaped down from the wall and slowly fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley’s voice came: “In fact, you and I are kind of people, people who are unscrupulous for their own desires.”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s feet on the ground, calmly replied: “You’re right, but there are still some differences between you and me.”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Shirley’s voice suddenly came from the ear, with a warm, full of aroma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge’s heart slammed and walked down the hill with a firm footstep: “I have more principles and a bottom line than you.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley floated in midair, looking at Su Ge’s back, and took out a dozen black things like moths, and said coldly: "Yagu City, voyeurism is forbidden. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finish, directly crush these things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leisurely sitting in the hills of Laurie suddenly changed his attitude, then suddenly looked up to the top of the mountain: "This water is really deep."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past two days his attention has not been on Su Ge, but in the city and in other organizations around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surgical knowledge of Su Ge often makes some indiscriminate attacks, it is easy to shatter his magic, plus he has enough for Su Ge The understanding, so his gaze is more in the city and other organizations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a secret monitoring, he has a deeper understanding of the whole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cure the church split soon, Horace, who is affiliated with the black robe, intends to kill Jenny, who belongs to the white robe, so he is united with the cold-blooded church to get rid of her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Glorious Church has two bishops whose core purpose is to find the whereabouts of Ada Newton, and intends to make a profit in this chaos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same idea is also the Elf Order and many other mysteries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nighthawk Church has a greater ambition, and they get news that there are at least five holy grail documents in the city, and their goal is to bring all the holy grail documents back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal of the Cold Church is to find the Frost Witch and look for the whereabouts of the Holy Grail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The core goal of the Fortress is to sneak hunters, and there is little interest in other things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last is the church of the late bell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not see the battle today. Because at that time his core attention was placed in the city, and several of the bats that he left behind were found to have been eaten by a bat of a higher vampire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In any case, it’s just the light of the firefly. The big force led by the dark star can arrive tomorrow. From now on, it can’t be done for Su Ge. Too worried. His ability is really good in this kind of environment. People in the city who have similar dark knowledge to me, my magic will be greatly limited. There are many unnecessary things in Su Ge. Casualties."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Su Ge returned to the camp under the mountain, he found that the entire camp had been refurbished, and Sapir was being gloomy and stunned by Childe. Related Nighthawk Church staff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside, a thin, middle-aged man sat there, quietly eating only quarter-cooked beef, even chewing with a hard bovine bone. Go on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not far away, Horace’s face is also very gloomy and reprimanded by his own hands, and his eyes are full of sorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the great genius of the church known as the comforter, Jenny was killed by the cold-hearted church! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The camp that was previously run down because of the battle has been reworked at this time, and it looks no different from when it left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger and Sonic in the corner looked at Horace, who was acting, with a hint of playfulness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Su Ge came back, he suddenly shocked everyone, even Sapir and Horace, who were being reprimanded, were shocked and stopped, sluggish Look over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Sog’s body is full of blood, and the whole body also has bloody stench and an ominous breath, just like a god who just climbed out of hell. general. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You...all right?" Moore hurried after seeing it and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge shook his head: "Nothing, it’s a little tired."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mour finished A little quiet inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these coalitions, Su Ge is the most worthy person to believe and rely on, the night eagle and heal two old slickers. He has no sense of trust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger and Hills both rushed over and quickly took Suge back to the camp for washing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outside of Sapir and Horace have a tacit agreement to stop reprimanding, because they are now more focused on Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be seen by individuals that Su Ge has a big gain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People dissipated silently and continued their recent work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thin butcher still sat there, his small eyes staring at the tent that Sug walked into, his nose moving, and his eyes deep in his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smells the familiar bloody smell, which kills a lot of rich blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Undressing and lying in the bath, Su Ge feels comfortable and long breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For him with a mild cleansing, this process is like walking from hell into heaven. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the edge of the bath, there is a larger basin, and the black cloak is squirming inside, washing away the blood on his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Adult, do you need to recite it?" Hills didn't know where to walk in, his eyes sparkling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled and sat up slightly: "Oh, by the way, today's situation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Hills looked at him with a happy face, picked up the towel and wiped the blood from the solidification behind Su Ge slowly. While wiping, he said about the battle today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jenny was hurt, but she could heal herself. Now she and Frost follow the apostles and teachers in their camps." Hills explained Road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge closed his eyes and imagined the scene at the time. He said with a smile: "Well, it’s very imposing, let us have a long face in the church."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course!" Hills slid his chin as if he were a proud swallow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looked at her side and smiled, not talking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hills looked at Su Ge seriously, while his face was reddish and looked at Su Ge’s face and back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"咦?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong?" Su Ge asked with his eyes closed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hills looked seriously at Su Ge’s left corner and said seriously: “Adult, you have white hair.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg didn't care too much, and slammed his forehead and said, "Normal, the computing load of the recent period is very large, far beyond the normal level. This body is still the body of mortals. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The big talent is twenty-five years old?" Hills had some concerns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled: "White hair doesn't mean anything, don't think too much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Well." Hills nodded and continued to groan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half an hour, the refreshing Su Ge was replaced with a brand new black suit into the coalition camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I just walked into the camp, I was asked by Sapir and Horace: "How is the situation?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looked around, not only the two of them, but also the thin middle-aged, Moore, Joel, Bells and other leaders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The situation is more serious." Su Ge said with a dignified face and sat down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moore said seriously: "Please ask the bishop to elaborate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded: “I wandered around the city for a long time and saw a lot of monsters. But what really worried me was not the monster, but the mystery.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The mystery?" Bells tempted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge shook his head: "No, but a mysterious person who is stimulated by interest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp After that, Su Ge said what he saw and saw in the outer city when he came back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listening to it, all the people present except the butcher were full of shock and full of shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The secret treasures of the earth, through the sacrifice of companions to get the secret treasure ... What do they want to do?" Bells clenched his fist and whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sapir's eyes sparkled with a strange light, and the depths of Horace's eyes also produced some eagerness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge continued: "Of course, the most important thing is not this, but the consequences of leaking the news after those who hold the secret treasure. More people are here to hunt for treasures, and more people will die in the city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Must completely block the news!" Moore's face is dignified Ordered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes! Must be blocked!" Sapir and Horace followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others agreed to nod. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In addition, the news of our request for assistance has been sent out, and the second wave of expeditionary forces at the headquarters is coming. This time, the band leader is the archbishop of the lord. Saprier added. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge listened to his heart and said: "This is the important information I got this time, I hope to be useful to you."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Useful, of course useful!" Moore gave a full affirmation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, this news is very critical. If you don’t know it later, it’s very likely to cause a huge mess," Bells said seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg said that he stood up: "I am a little tired, and I will see how to block the deployment."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, turn around and get out of the camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the camp, Su Ge first used the aftermath of the night clock to make sure that the four weeks without surveillance, nodded slightly, then summoned everyone to say: "Next Time, when communicating with each other, the tone is strict, don't let others find any problems, and our related cards, big men are about to appear, and we have only one chance to fight back, understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
