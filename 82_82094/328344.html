			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shipyard in the north of the city is close to the edge of the northern river. A few years ago, many workers were killed by collapsed ships due to an accident, and huge compensation for shipbuilding The owner of the factory went bankrupt overnight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe because there were too many people who died at that time, they did not deal with it well. After the court collected it, it was going to be an auction event when it was auctioned. Shelved, ruined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing at the bridgehead, Su Ge looked at the shipyard near the river in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vast venue is full of ruins and the wreckage of the ships, the grass is overgrown, the ground is very muddy due to the melting snow, the door of the factory is downside, one side Hanging on the folding page, the wind is blowing and screaming, and it feels like it may fall at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After far-reaching, you can feel a breeze and a run-down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the footsteps, Su Ge walked along the edge of the shipyard as a pedestrian, releasing the aftermath of the night bell as he passed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transmission of sound is in all directions, with a very conductive aftermath that seeps into the ground and quickly reveals the situation beneath the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Studio City has a very sound underground drainage facility. This wide sewer is no less than the foreign sewers in the movie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sewer is very normal, with no need to pay attention except for some mice and beasts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But under the sewer, Suger perceives a relatively large space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The area of ​​this space seems to be excavated in the area of ​​the shipyard. The Suog standing here can only feel some sides of the space in the lower right side of it. angle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the edge of space, Sug "sees" some people who are walking around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the outside, these people are wearing thick and bloated clothes, with a mask, should be researchers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The whole area is just below the shipbuilding, and there is no extra eyes. The depth should be about five meters from the surface. They should be developed based on the sewers left by the shipyard.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basic situation is determined, Su Ge quickly leaves, he does not want to be noticed now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Away from the shipyard, Su Ge took a circle around the outer circle and came to the northern suburbs of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the northern suburbs, you can see the other side of the shipyard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other side of the shipyard, part of which is close to the big river, covered in woods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The forest should be the place where Hills saved Connor. Since there was a cockroach there, there will be more people there. The problem is not big, I am very good at sneak into it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, there is nothing like a walkie-talkie in this era, otherwise it will be troublesome."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Raise the right hand, the claws of which are shot, and then take the Sugg to a towering poplar tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This location is very good, you can see the situation around the entire shipyard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let me see how many people are there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next afternoon At the time, Su Ge was swaying in this piece, observing the situation around him from different angles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, under the shipyard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The inside of the assassin who was sent to the palace to assassinate the assassin should be lost. It is estimated that there will be more and more fierce. The assassin will definitely tell us about the situation here after he wakes up. What should I do?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dimly lit conference room, four middle-aged people in white coats sat together to discuss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They will definitely send people to explore, we must strengthen our defense." One said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ordinary people can't do it, add powerful mystery, at least professional!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, mystery is the core."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was suddenly opened when the four people talked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Salo, who was wearing a white coat, walked in with a gloomy face. When the four men saw it, they closed their mouths and looked at Dr. Salo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The situation is clear to you, right?" Salo whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The plan has changed, we have to speed up the action, we must quickly produce all the plagues." Salo said directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged people in glasses are somewhat embarrassed to say: "The director, in the current situation, will complete all the plagues, at least three days, if it is accelerated, There will be problems with the quality of the plague."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know, but there is no time, even if you sacrifice some quality, you will have all in the next twenty hours. The plague was finished." Salo ordered the death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The director, with our current strength, they should not dare to attack, even if the assassin will say everything, they can only watch Can't stop, why are we so anxious?" asked the middle-aged man with a small eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These four people are all sacred to Salo, and he has not concealed at this time, directly saying: "The human face rat who was sent to the palace was killed." It was dead. In the morning, some people explored the Dukes of the Mountain Range, and the traces of the Lord’s discovery were quietly discovered by the Lord. Later, the human face rats were killed.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"What!? How is this possible!" Hearing this, the four people suddenly became shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saro’s face said gloomyly: “On the other hand, Hayden, Kent, and John were attacked by mysterious people, and they have been caught in the palace, to the worst. In the case of the calculation, Hayden and Chuan did not die, but to the old demon hunter, our plan is likely to be completely exposed. If they know all the plans, we are completely passive."
