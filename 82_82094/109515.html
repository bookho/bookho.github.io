			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beasts on the ground have different bodies, including wolves, bears, deer, and rabbits, pheasants and other small animals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time the bodies of these beasts were dismembered, the blood was painted into inscriptions, and the bones of the skull and limbs were built around the weird shape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing such a scene, suddenly shocked Su Ge, my heart was shocked: "My God, what is going on?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, he sighed and smelled it, then he looked disgusted and didn’t know what it was hating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of Su Ge’s voice awakened two witches who were meditating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When two people opened their eyes, the deep gray-blue flashed and returned to normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seeing Su Ge, the two hurriedly got up and said: "Apostles!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge looked calm and gave a slight nod. "What are these corpses?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bennis wiped the blood on his mouth and explained: " Three days ago, we accepted the power of the Lord. But this power was too large for us to digest. At that time we felt that we were going to become ice cubes and died immediately."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hills went on to say: "Instinct, we feel that we need some blood to help us through the storm. Then we ran out at night and caught two wolves. By drinking its blood, the body The cold gradually eased."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benice continues: "With the deepening of the integration, some deep secret knowledge has appeared in our minds, and this knowledge tells We have some related runes. By offering sacrifices of blood, bones and flesh, we can make our smoother integration of our Lord to us. Strength."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After that, we arrested more beasts for sacrifices, and finally grasped some of the basic strengths last night to withstand the cold. But this kind of knowledge is too big, we can still hear countless people whispering in our ears at this time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The sacrifice? Who are you offering to? I have not received anything!" Su Ge was full of wonder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilsh smiled at this time, his smile was very bright, but with her blood on his face, it gave a special embarrassment and surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But compared to those whispers that are sometimes absent, we feel very good now, and my body has changed a bit, maybe it will allow us to fit into normal Going out of the crowd."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After getting the affirmation and reward of their faith, the two fearsome witches are now full of confidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger here to deal with intelligence in his mind, temporarily in the bottom of his heart, eyes carefully looked at two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They look like subtle changes in their minds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These changes, combined with the changes in their temperament, and the traces of the years, made them completely out of the two pitiful little girls on the wanted portrait, Became two other people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After watching the lap, Su Ge’s heart flashed a bit of worry: “Will it take too much power to make two people completely broken and change? The spirit is somewhat abnormal?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is wrong with us? Apostle adults?" Hills seems to be very good at insight, curious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge shook his head and said, "The change is a bit big and it doesn't fit very well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ers smiled: "Please rest assured, we are my loyal fighters, and your most trusted partner and compatriots. You can use us as much as you can, as long as we can carry forward the glory of our Lord, we will be broken, "There is no hesitation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;British mouth with a strange smile said: "The body is shattered, we have our own soul."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s over, it’s over, I want to mess up. The two lovely kindness before, How did the lovable witch suddenly become such a strange and mad believer!?" Su Ge felt regret at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hills then stepped forward and approached Suge, asking with hope: "My Lord said that you are going to build a church for my Lord. When will you start?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, I looked closely at the beautiful face of Hills. Before that, the face of a cute girl next door was gone. Instead, it was replaced by a strong, glamorous look. Mature style. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present look is more tempting than before, yet it gives a very different sense of oppression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge instinct stepped back and coughed and said: "Don’t worry! Our Lord is more concerned with the safety of the people than the one who spreads his own light. Since you can now be integrated into normal people, the first thing to solve is your identity problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, he is a little nervous because he obviously feels His own gas field was suppressed by Hills! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Day! I am your god! Now God is actually suppressed by the believers!" Su Ge yelled in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compared to the more radical Hills at this time, Bernice, who was calm and cold before, was calm and steady. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time she came to Hills and said: "My Lord said that the things here are all based on the apostles, and you should not be too anxious. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes! Right!" Su Ge breathed a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hills blinked and nodded. "Also, our previous identity was too sensitive."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, fortunately, the reasoning aspect is still very sound." Hearing this, Su Ge rest assured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is really afraid that these two girls will become mad believers who are similar to the previous ones and can’t listen to people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here, the attention of two people suddenly fell on the body of Erha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this..." Seeing Erha, the eyes of both people were full of shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge’s face is mysterious and said: “This is the gift of my Lord to me. Just know, don’t say it.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people suddenly became big Eyes, nodded in a hurry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the body is smaller, the momentum is also restrained, but the two people who have seen the incomplete body of Su Ge are still recognized at a glance. Going up to some stupid dog, it is the mount of that one, or the incarnation of the mount. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge said here: "In the last few days, you will stay here to hide, I will get your identity problem as soon as possible and enter the city to live. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two men nodded after listening, still as grateful as they were before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although some changes have taken place in personality, they are all subtle, and the impact should not be too big." Su Ge thought of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that, Su Ge did not stop here. After leaving here, he took a second sprint and returned to the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Breakfast, Su Ge and Ida chat with each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Demonstration?" Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge suddenly heard that Ada had been participating in the demonstrations for the past few days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ada arbitrarily said: "Well, I started with humanitarian organizations. This winter is very cold. I have frozen a lot of tramps in recent times. I have some I can't bear it, so I found a humanitarian organization. I hope that the government can give these unidentified tramps an opportunity to register their accounts. On the one hand, it can be easily managed. On the other hand, the tramp can have the opportunity to re-employ."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ada, are you too much?" Su Ge muttered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ada doesn’t care, smiles and touches Su Ge’s head and says, “The tramp is also a person. If you can help, help, we want to be inside. Good, help others."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, Ida’s face showed an indescribable holy smile and continued: "The government has contacted me yesterday. It’s not too good to have a meeting to get the tramp reincorporated into the household registration? Let the unidentified person have the opportunity to live again.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
