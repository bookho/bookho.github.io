			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The youth did not make Su Ge too careful, he did not feel angry, but felt a little funny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Speaking in the real world, do you really think that people who can buy everything with money? I thought that this kind of person can only exist in some novels. In the villain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking in the heart, Su Ge has come to the police station. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two giant steel robots at the door are still patrolling with vigilance, and the steam behind them is constantly ejected, giving a full sense of security. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take the door of the police station and walk in, just seeing Roland holding a cup of coffee and passing by. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey! Beautiful lady!" Su Ge said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard Sug’s voice, Roland stunned and turned to look at Su Ge, the contemplative face suddenly smiled and asked: "Hey! Look! Who is back!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sound is very loud, and the other policemen around him hear this voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sug? You are recovering really fast!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Long time no see, How is the body recovering?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“What is blood therapy like? It’s amazing!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey? This dog is very interesting, is it yours?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a passionate inquiry, Su Ge fully felt the people Passion and concern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of people walked around the office in Su Ge, and Su Ge said something about his experience, which was not important, and then focused on the introduction. Erha body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to Su Ge’s introduction, all the police officers were attracted to this big dog who was full of spirituality, understanding, and looks good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Erha was very happy that he could attract the attention of so many people, but he did not show much under the benefit of Su Ge, only showing his own cleverness and psychic aspects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha! Your dog... Haha! I don’t know what, I want to laugh when I see it.” Jack, who didn’t know what to do, came over and watched At the time, the two ears with their ears up and their eyes wide open, and they couldn’t help but laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled: "Luobo’s expression is indeed richer than the average dog. Sometimes it looks like a little silly, people think Laugh."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack put down the file on hand and patted Sug’s shoulder and said, "Yes, it’s very good recovery!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge sighed: "Yeah, but I haven’t suffered too much, the potion, I don’t want to drink it for the second time in my life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Others heard this silence, and the atmosphere was a bit dignified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge hurriedly switched the topic: "Right, what is the follow-up of the ghost ship? I immediately fainted after telling the intelligence to Master Gerlos. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland said: "After all the evidence is retained, in order to prevent some other accidents, the fire has completely burned down. Those who are you The purified body was buried after being reported by the autopsy, and was personally presided over by Bishop Ron. The sketches and materials of the relevant personnel have been sent to the Imperial Capital by telegram to wait for verification there."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack squats down and gently grinds the black hair of Erhua Guanghua: "The incident was characterized as an unexpected event that happened not here, just after our hands, now it has been paid I was responsible for the Imperial Marine Police, and it has nothing to do with us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded after listening, then curiously asked: "After that Is there anything else happening in the city?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbs Jack; casually said: "No, since the martial law, the city's public security is very good. Although this matter is rather fierce, it has nothing to do with the locals, and there is not much attention, and it has not affected the lives of the citizens. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge did not continue to ask questions, and when he turned around, he found that Roland was in meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you seem to have?" Su Ge asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack smiled and said: "Her marriage has been settled. Just two months later, the lady of this beauty is thinking about how to take advantage of the short marriage leave. Come and enjoy more romance.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland listened and said: “You are useless, old bachelor!”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Congratulations, congratulations!" Su Ge said in his mouth, and he said in his heart: "I hope that there is no colleague in this world to marry. I have to say it with the ceremony. My economy is already very tense." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, Su Ge is still in a state of paid leave for work-related injuries, so there is no hard working order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After taking a walk around Luobo and introducing it to your colleagues, he went to Ossen to report that he can go to work tomorrow, he left the police station. Ready to go home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a street, Su Ge saw an acquaintance waiting for himself with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Long time no see, Lord of the Heroes." Bart, who speaks, is a French-speaking language. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge squinted and said with a smile: "Mr. Bart’s learning ability is really amazing, and it’s possible to practice Belan in three days. Authentic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart knows that Suge is lying in sarcasm and screams: "In order to express my apology, I can give you a very crucial piece of information. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg is not moving: "Are you sure that it is a key intelligence for me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart does not change the color and says: "Yes, even threatening your personal safety."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Whether it will also threaten What is the security and reputation of your organization?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“This has little impact on our organization, but it will affect your entire city.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
