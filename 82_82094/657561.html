			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On June 11, the first day of flight:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ao Shen No.6 Starship spacecraft does not It is the most advanced spacecraft of all mankind. Her engine and energy system are so amazing and fascinating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decomposes water into hydrogen and oxygen, and the energy produced by hydrogen fusion allows the entire spacecraft to fly for thousands of years at the fastest speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The simultaneous decomposition of oxygen can give 30% of the oxygen consumption of 120 crew members on the spacecraft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just seeing this, Su Ge’s face is wonderful and can’t be described. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Spaceship? Water-fueled nuclear fusion reactor!?" Seeing this, Su Ge suddenly felt that the worldview was greatly affected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others, it’s still the days of the steampunk industrial revolution, it’s already a mystery to hear the spaceship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, what I saw at this moment is actually a super civilization that is more than a thousand years older than the technology of the earth? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is unimaginable and unbelievable for Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can it be said that before the world was shattered, it has developed into a super-civilization that far exceeds the earth? A water-fueled nuclear fusion reactor. I have seen so many science fiction novels and movies, and I have never seen this ideal power system."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this short paragraph, put the world view of Su Ge Refreshed many times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take a deep breath and calm down your frustrated heart and continue to look down:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The launching process was very smooth. The one-kilometer-long Olympus 6 was like a tall mountain. Under the watchful eyes of the researchers, I followed the spacecraft off the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our goal this time is that astronomers observed a planet that was moving on its own six months ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The planet is very special, she seems to be absolutely still, and seems to be constantly moving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She does not rotate around the star, nor does it rotate. She seems to wander in the universe like a meteorite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What makes us even more surprised is that the planet seems to have some special activity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting there we need about seventy years of sailing, but fortunately we have a powerful biological hibernation system that allows us to ignore the long river of time and carry out A miracle like time and space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this, Su Ge’s heart exclaimed: “Sure enough, this technology has gone far beyond the level of the earth, and I don’t know how many years have passed.” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After marveling, Su Ge looked at the planet described by Kasma, and suddenly there was some anxiety in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On June 12, the second day of flight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After three rounds of flight, the spacecraft completed the acceleration of the cubic motion through the gravitational spiral of the world. Today, our speed can reach one tenth of the speed of light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this day I saw our world from the stars for the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have always thought that the whole world is round, like those planets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I was wrong, this is a beautiful crystal, called the dodecahedron of crafts. She is the mother who gave birth to us and is the unique existence of the entire astral world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, we have not figured out so far, clearly that our world does not have any satellites, why do we have three moons, which is totally inconsistent with astronomy common sense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is the dodecahedron? The three moons are not celestial bodies? There are no satellites outside the planet!?" Seeing this, Su Ge was even more surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you say that pressing the three rounds of the moon is not the moon!" For a moment, Su Ge’s inspiration was like electricity, because he instantly remembered Shirley. What I said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said that the three rounds of the moon are ugly monsters...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪嗒! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking, Su Ge’s vision has grown a little longer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The growth of Lingshi suddenly brought Su Ge’s thoughts back to reality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He reached for his forehead and actually had a layer of fine sweat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The higher the spirit, the harder it is to grow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only a handful of people who can achieve 88 like Ron in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, the high vision does not mean that strength is strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one wants to have a high level of vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The three moons, there is a problem." Su Ge has already clenched his fists unconsciously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regain your mood again and continue to look down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;June 14th. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yesterday, the simulated gravity system was being debugged. We can't live too long without weight loss, so the gravity system is especially important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pear actually laughed at my habit of using a notebook to keep a diary. It’s a superficial guy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These computers are not reliable, they often make mistakes, especially when encountering a star storm and passing a black hole, the ghost knows what will happen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s the simplest way to take notes, even if I am dead, my book can still be passed on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s awkward today, because standing here, our lovely and beautiful mother star has become a light spot, like a star. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This feeling of leaving home is not comparable to that of other cities and other countries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That light spot symbolizes everything that we have existed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;June 17th. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spacecraft has been commissioned and the relevant personnel have entered the hibernation warehouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may be the last record of my or even decades. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After three hours, I have to enter the hibernation warehouse. But I don't know why, my heart always feels a little bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doctor said that my blood flow rate suddenly increased at some point, and I felt that it was not very good at that time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feeling is wonderful, it seems that someone is calling me in the blood, let me stop moving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Haha, this should be a temporary psychological barrier from the parent star. I am an engineering scientist, how can I believe those ridiculous superstitions? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All religions, mysteries, and superstitions were wiped out by Oradein the Great as early as 20,000 years ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keep a good attitude, I am a star pioneer! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this, Su Ge closed the book and did not continue to read it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the contents of these four articles have revealed that in addition to countless horrifying news, even this kind of news is subversive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two thousand years ago? The dynasty seemed to last at least 20,000 years, and in that era technology developed rapidly, all mystery, religion, superstition It disappears. That is to say, it is an absolutely rational scientific world, and the development of science has left the earth far behind and entered the level of super civilization."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp The body leans on the chair, and Su Ge looks at the sun in the sky and mutters: "What kind of disaster has the world experienced? The super civilization has not escaped, but it has been completely annihilated in history." !?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
