			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other side, Su Ge has sat quietly on the throne, but his attitude is somewhat weird. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a respectful sorrow here, and the gesture is full of worship and piety, like the most devout believers in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have any other way to carry it?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shuel immediately squatted on the ground and said: "Please ask my lord to sin, and the servant's ability is nothing more than this. It is a sin to make my lord's gods humiliate. "Don't die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge sounded steadily: "Get up! Shure, I forgive you for your behavior."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for the kindness and magnanimity of my Lord." Shure said with respect and respect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now answer my question, do you have this kind of possessive ability?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the ground, Shu Erzhen said seriously: "Yes, the form of the servant is too low. Because the channel of summoning is not enough, the servant can only pass the phantom of a small part of the body, and the only way to carry it is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug has a little embarrassed after listening to his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just got the first sacrifice in God's life, Su Ge is very happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So let Shure give the woman warlock some revelation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that, Sugeton was very embarrassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing that this Shur used his only possessive means, he wanted to control the body of the professional-level female warlock to give Su Ge the gift. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, his body was drilled into the body of the female warlock from all directions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black fog in the house at the time was only a superficial phenomenon. If the vision is sufficient, you can see that there are countless dark, sticky with a lot of green eyes. The liquid is constantly floating in the air, and the black mist is only emitted from his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Shur's method of drilling was very primitive and violent. He first entangled the body of the female warlock with his body, and then drilled into her body along some holes of the female warlock, completing the complete possession. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The address given by Su Ge was written by the possession. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Su Ge’s ideology is attached to it, it’s clear how the feeling of this possession gives the female warlock a feeling and stimulation. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of behavior suddenly reminded him that when he was on Earth, he saw some of the tentacles, so he made his face red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the honest Shure at this time, Su Ge also knows that this method is the most direct and the most normal method in his worldview. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Forget it, just like this! In the current form of Schugus, there is no other way to possess it." Su Ge thought about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You performed very well this time, Shure." Su Ge praised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get the praise of Su Ge, when he was stunned, he trembled on the ground and said, "The servant is afraid."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge said faintly: "You don't have to worry, since you say it, it is really satisfying to you, don't think too much. If I am not satisfied, you will hear thunder and wind, but My words, do you know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes! The servant understands!" said Shur, excited and happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The master's praise and touch is the greatest happiness for a dog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is now one of the two dogs of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go on, don't need to talk to me next time, you can ask directly with Vanas, understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, Shur’s transformation into a black mist disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the departure of Shure, Su Ge raised his hand and looked at the two balls of light in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two light balls are the size of a head, a pure gold, a pure purple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold represents the pure faith of that female warlock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mysterious power extracted from the purple representative offerings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the essence of sacrifice. This purple energy is extracted from those mysterious materials, and it has a good nourishing effect on the gods. It can be transformed into pure power, which is very good for every god."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through this experience, Su Ge has completely figured out the so-called offering The essence of sacrifices, rituals, spells, and mysterious materials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called sacrifice is actually feeding the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the gods cannot directly interfere with the material plane, but there are many substances in the material plane that have what the gods like. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The array method is the channel that establishes a connection with the god. The spell is the ringing of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more the spell is blown, the better the effect, indicating that the flattery is also effective for the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the gods feel satisfied with the respect of the believers, they will come through the circle and see if the things in the altar are what they want. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want, you will take it away and give those people some small favors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don't like it, or feel annoying, then the summoner is the catastrophe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the reason why the probability of sacrifice of the sacrifice is high. There are so many gods and so many mysterious materials. Who can guarantee that the material they are preparing is that god? What I like? This thing is just like buying a lottery ticket and hitting the big fortune."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In materials science and mineralogy, there are eleven major categories, As well as a number of small classifications, it is estimated that these are the previous experience of those people, and a small class corresponds to a god's preference."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For a long time, the occult material classification of human beings is just a snack menu for the gods!" Su Ge suddenly disappeared at this moment, suddenly feeling that this mysterious system is somewhat naive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is like an adult seeing a distressed baby, handing a snack to the baby, and the baby will smile happily if he likes it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are not happy, you will cry even more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this crying is more powerful, representing destruction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Su Ge thought of the black-blooded twins who always liked their own ice flames. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one god is supposed to eat his own ice flame as a snack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking about it all, Su Ge looked down at the purple sphere in his hand: "This sphere is pure mysterious energy, and the species belongs to the material science eleven In the cold system, I am the god of hoarfrost, so it is very suitable for my divine right. I like it all, and I have a strong nourishment for me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "On the other hand, it is also determined that the specific things of all sacrifices cannot be brought back to the Kingdom of God. They completely grind the material form into a pure mysterious form when they are accepted across dimensions. The advanced form that represents those gods is a pure form of energy that allows them to have endless life and better integrate into the rules of the world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Determining the issue of the sacrifice, Su Ge placed his gaze on the golden sphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the purest power of faith. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The power of faith is universal for each god, and its effect is of no use to the gods themselves. Its role is to increase the range and momentum of the gods, and It is the external equipment and weapons of the gods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not what Su Ge imagined out of thin air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because in his power, the power of faith can not only expand the land of the kingdom of God, build buildings, but even become warships, armor, and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The armor formed by a single power is ok in the kingdom of God, but it is not strong if it enters the material world, because they do not belong to that world. If you want to be strong, you must have something that can be accepted by the world. And this Things are beliefs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With the power of faith as a support, the armor constructed by divine power is truly sturdy."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "No wonder those gods are desperately developing their own believers, spreading the way to summon themselves. It turns out that there are so many benefits."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Suge said, looking up at his own kingdom of God: "I have come to such a scale with such a small amount of faith, and the power of faith collected by the goddess of March can not build a world!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Su Ge is more and more aware of the inscrutable horror of the March goddess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the outside world, there are internal and other dominators and the gods of the ancient gods, and the world is still the mainstream for so many years, the power of Theocracy has reached the point of horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Before I felt like the three goddesses, I imagined that I was too naive. I will be more careful later."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge was secretly vigilant at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the analysis, he found that the March Goddess is far more than herself in any aspect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The hunter is nothing but the fallen god in the war of God, and the goddess of March can stand proud of the gods for so many years, and it is not without reason." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, there was a knock at the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My Lord, Vanas is here." The voice of the storm guard said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning, he asked the Cavaliers to inform Vanas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly: "Come in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
