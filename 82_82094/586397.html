			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When walking out of the corridor, Su Ge said calmly: "I generally know who wants to push me out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is this cultist?" asked Shirley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded: "The process of my contact with Drake should be in his surveillance, even if he has already understood Drake’s seal. , I am going to try my bottom."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know who is fearless, it's ironic." Shelly's mouth smirked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug couldn’t help but smile: "This guy may be incomparably tricky for others, but unfortunately meet me, he is a joke. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The late night of Su Ge’s soul, has a strong calming effect on most of the spiritual influences, and even allows the beastized Luke to be restored. Normal people have 100% confidence in the mental impact of this alleged perpetrator. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter how he releases his knowledge, after a late night, everything will return to normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for his ability to drag people into a nightmare to kill, Su Ge even prayed for him poorly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope that is not a real nightmare, if it is a nightmare, you will die if you are a bad boy." Sug said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the three years since he came to the world, he has never encountered such a case that can be used as a killing game. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am going to eat whale slices," said Shearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge quickly said: "Go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, as Su Ge planned, everything seems to have not happened, still so calm, he still eats, drinks, and does not take any measures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the Emperor of the Belle Empire, Hui Yao City, Tokachi District, Admiral Grasse Manor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Admiral Green’s study, he is communicating with a middle-aged man in a black suit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man did not wear a bow tie, but a short tie like a silk scarf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the silver-gray tie, there are some dark gold lines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the faint, you can see that the grain is like a coat of arms. It looks like a shiny cabinet with a dark gold triangle crown on the cupboard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is, he is not dead." The middle-aged man sits relaxed and relaxed, but gives a strong sense of oppression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of oppression is only Green can offset and bear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green nodded: "The founder of the Church of the Late Bells, the Pope of the late bell, the descendant of the bell, these can be called him."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name of Sog Sotos has been banned by the March church in a special way, similar to the name of the god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at different times, Su Ge’s name can be meditation in his heart, but his mouth can’t read it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the name of the gods can’t be remembered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All mysteries don’t know how the church did it in March, but the ban was applied to every mysterious person in a mysterious and mysterious way. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the true voice of the church in March! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man’s mouth has a hint of smile: “The Pope’s courage is really big enough, so dare to come to the capital, here is the Church of the Holy Blood. The base camp."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green said calmly: "So he needs our help, and we need his destruction."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man agreed to nod: "The new round of witch hunting has been postponed for two years. In March, the church seems to have nothing to prepare. We are going to destroy this witch hunting."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Destruction? Is it really necessary to go to the Asylum Witch?" Green's face was a little dignified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strength of the church in March is too great, there is no problem in sheltering, and the church will close one eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the destruction of the glory of the witch has been hunting for thousands of years, it is equivalent to the face of everyone, and the face of the church in March Slap, but also spit out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was really an anxious church in March, there were no people in the world who could not find them, nor did they kill the immortal existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green knows something through the ciphertext of the palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They even planned to kill the emperor who was riding the dragon, but in the end they gave up because they had to pay too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s worth noting that it’s not sure, just because it’s too expensive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is terrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green hates the March church, but he understands the power of the church in March. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man’s mysterious smile: “Do not worry, by the time the church can’t estimate it in March, they won’t pay attention to us.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Does the brother know what message?" Green asked earnestly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man shook his head: "The secret of that level is not what you and I are qualified to know. You only need to know that your brother will never deceive you." I am two."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green nodded and said clearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man was named Kos Job, two of whom had played at school 30 years ago and have since become a buddy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two went to college together, joined the army together, joined the mystery together, and built merits together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, Green has become a legendary general. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this Kos, became the great man of the imperial capital today: the head of the Shining Holy Knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glory of the Holy Knights, although it is a Knights, but it is not only responsible for the security and security of the entire palace, but also responsible for the security work of the entire Hui Yao City . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The word glory in its name is derived from the glory city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the empire is also the guardian of the empire, with the big man wearing weapons to enter the palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are even a lot of conspiracy theories to calculate, if Coase wants to rebel, he can lead his subordinates to all the people in the palace in less than an hour. The slaughter was over, and in an hour and a half, he won the dominion of Hui Yaocheng. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this is just some conspiracy theory that sounds very sinister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it is Green, or Coase is very clear, the wisdom and strategy of the owner of a palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it wasn’t for that one, neither of them could get this step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The recent female warlocks in the city are not very stable. They really thought they could pass my eyes and ears. The decaying church can't see it, I can see it. Very clear." Kos sneered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green calmly said: "Do not move this thing on your side."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know Otherwise, they died early." Coase said casually." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green looked down at the information in his hand and said: "He has his own power in the capital, and some things we can't face, can be pushed to him. Although We don't know what happened in Yagu Castle at the time, but we can see that the church seems to be jealous of him in March, otherwise it will not let him stay for so long with the investigation ability of the church in March."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coase came to the interest: "Listen to you, I really can't wait. He seems to be less than thirty years old?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Green nodded: "According to the intelligence at the time, he is already a master, and he bears a kind of stigma."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"St. Mark!?" Hearing this, even Kos was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the holy mark, what kind of will and qualifications are needed to bear the holy mark, he is very clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greenn said: "But it is still unclear. Due to the blockade of the church in March, many news were misunderstood, and everyone present was banned. Even the lone wolf is the same."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Coase is silent: "Hold him, he is our main force against the church in the future, and also us. The key to this break."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have already arranged the manpower, no one has found it. This time Albert found him, it should be to clean up the four colleges. Parasite, he is very good at this kind of work. The only thing we need to pay attention to is the Brotherhood of the King of Yellow and the Cthulhu Order on the ship."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Coase said his intelligence: "The Brotherhood of the King of the Yellow King is indeed a hidden danger, but I have already contacted the Windsor Travelers and the Travel Masters House. They should not let this unscrupulous organization continue to develop."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As for the Cthulhu Order, I also check The roots of this church are very long, even dating back to the gods, but for unknown reasons, the church itself has not risen, but several notorious cult organizations have been separated from the church."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Which?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Institute of Polar Studies, the annihilation, the source of the deep sea, the Alliance of Stars. Coase said four notorious names, which can be said to be full of bad names. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard these four names, Green’s face was gloomy: “My people and the source of the deep sea have dealt with the Star Alliance, it’s really a group of people without reason. The madman. In the case of the small fishing village, was the source of the deep sea?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coase nodded, leaning his hands on the sofa and looking up at the ceiling: "I sometimes wonder, how can there be so many cults in this world?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Green heard the silence for a long time and said four words: "Because of fear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because of fear..." Coase deeply tastes these four words, not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚咚咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of rushing sounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green has some helpless words: "Come in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This home, can knock on the door There is only one person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, and Tricia’s playful little head stepped in through the door and spit out the tongue against Green. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Little Tracy, it has become beautiful again," Coase said with approval. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has never been married and has no children for some reason, so he has always used Tsui Xi as his daughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Uncle Kos." After seeing the green, the relatives screamed and walked over and smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coss loves to look at Tracy, and smiles and asks: "I just got a little golden monkey yesterday, very beautiful, I will Let people send it to you and give you a pet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Golden little monkey? So cute!" Tracy thought about it and looked at the little star. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green sighed: "Don’t hang around you, Uncle Coase, is there anything?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to the song, Tracy immediately said, "I want to go to the street with Bernice, can I?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green smiled: "Go, on the road." Be careful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tui Xi immediately thanked him very happy, and then said very cutely: "You are not allowed to send someone to follow me!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
