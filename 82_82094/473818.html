			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge, who stayed at the border for one night, continued on the road the next morning in a carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the winding road, looking at the ups and downs of the land, and the windmill villages that can be seen on both sides, Sug squints The heart is very soothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He likes this kind of scenery, he is happy with this atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Guinness is a good place, I don't allow anyone to tarnish this land." Su Ge made up his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last night, the Viscount introduced him to the situation at the recent border. Four soldiers were killed inexplicably, and it was obviously the mysterious person’s handwriting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent days, the density of mysterious people has increased significantly. It seems that something is attracting them, and they are slowly gathering in the movie city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Holy Grail's volatility is getting bigger and bigger. Although the position has been determined, it cannot be approached." Su Ge is very wary of the situation there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The best situation is that each church forms a coalition, or the alliance goes together, so there is enough cannoning to test the situation."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty!" At this time, an escorted soldier rode his horse to the carriage and bent over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge asks: "Someone is going?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldier nodded: "It’s hidden. But they have a taste of fragrant orchids, and they can't hold my nose."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orchid is a mysterious material commonly used by warlocks and wizards, alchemists. Generally used for rituals and release some relatively powerful spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't worry too much, just know." Su Ge waved his hand and continued to close his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldier listened to the respectful retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the rear looks very normal in the team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three men are sitting in the carriage, wearing loose robes, and they seem to be a little servant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sug Sotos..." Three people looked down at the information in their hands, and the atmosphere was a bit dull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing to talk about is a thin, thin-headed young man: "It’s really rare for the Cold Church and the Institute of Polar Studies to be wanted at the same time."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is intelligence that he participated in the civil strife in Guinness, which led to the disappearance of the entire branch of the Institute of Polar Studies." . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last round-faced youth of the wavy hair said: "He offended the cold church in Bain, leading to the disappearance of a bishop of the cold-hearted church. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Looks like he is not as waste as the legend?" The young bearded man analyzed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young face of the face nodded slightly: "Is the person who chills the church and the people of the Institute of Polar Studies arrived?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's here, it's behind." Moustache said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wave head squinted and said: "Many people want his detailed information, the price is good. Just this time there is cannon fodder, the task should be less difficult. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The union seems to have been in contact with him?" asked the young man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wave head nodded: "It’s the Connaughter’s Connor, the sluggish madman, who refused to say it, really stupid.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That depends on our thieves union to shoot." Moustache said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Assassin Alliance consists of three trade unions, the Assassin Union, the Killing Crafts Association and the Thieves Union. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three trade unions are different in nature, with different directions and functions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Killing a manual will be an organization that specializes in killing people, just killing people and not asking others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Thieves Union is an organization that steals and probes intelligence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Assassin’s Union is more ethical, and they generally only deal with some corrupt officials, some cultists and wanted criminals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; also confirmed the existence of the Assassin Union, so that the gray organization of the Assassin Alliance can be acquiesced by many countries and churches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because they are not a group of killing madmen who see money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three are from the thieves’ union, and the main task this time is to conduct a detailed investigation of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Relatively calm along the way, after all, Guinness can be said to be Guotai Min'an in China, and there are very few criminal incidents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or the general foreign criminals have been directly killed by the parties, the body was treated on the spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close to noon, the carriage of the car suddenly slammed, and Su Ge felt the car tilted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Enemy?" Su Ge brows and picks up the night clock, but finds that the right rear wheel of the carriage has fallen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The front of the groom is very experienced, slamming, and quickly take out spare tires to deal with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg just got out of the carriage and took a look at the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weather is not very good today, the clouds in the sky are densely covered, and the gray-black lead clouds are a little breathless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a good weather to kill people." Su Ge looked at the sky and murmured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, a team behind stopped at the roadside, and then walked down a few youths wearing gray blouses, it seems that they just passed by and went to work in the city. Workers<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Do you need help? I think your carriage is very heavy." The brave man with the deer hat came over and asked very enthusiastically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The groom smiled and smiled: "Thank you, I have tools here, I don't need it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The groom has a machine similar to a jack, which can be leveraged. Tell the staggered carriage to support it. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; a few people listening to Oh sigh, do not hurry to leave, he turned around to see standing of Scotland: "Sir, you are the right person in town Look at your line should be very rich, do you need to recruit workers? Several of our brothers are good at work."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, several people Come together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug turned around and looked around the four people who were close, laughing: "Okay, what are you going to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ; & nbsp; & nbsp; deerstalker burly young face warm smile, he replied: "fight, nursing homes, move cargo, murder ......" <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; The voice just fell, the other three young people instantly twisted their hands together, and three powerful restraints acted on Su Ge's body, so that Su Ge could not move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the strong young man, took out a white handkerchief and went up to the nose of Su Ge, and smelled the pungent smell through the air. . <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Scotland expression hint of derision, as if watching the clumsy manner, ready to attack adult children. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pet, who was sitting behind Griffin, asked: "Do you really need us to help?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Griffin smiled and said: "It’s good to look at it quietly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the horror of Suger, Griffin It is the best thing to know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three thieves who are close to each other are hiding in the carriage and their eyes are shining. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "These people should be cold church people, right?" ass face Young excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wave head nodded: "An alchemist expert, three professional fighters."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young bearded man touched his moustache: "This configuration and such a close distance, there is no possibility of escaping for an expert mystery. The superposition of the three-layer professional-level restraint is equivalent to the thickness of the thumb. The hemp rope."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The alchemist's hand should be specially formulated. If you smell it, you will feel paralyzed. If you inhale directly, if you inhale it directly." ", will faint in the past."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is the occupation of Suger Sotos?" The young man suddenly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The information is written on the official."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no play, it seems that we still Some other means are needed to keep the people who are ignorant of the church so smooth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The roadside, the white cloth full of pungent smell is close at hand, Su Ge The eyes can even see the smug smile on the face of this sturdy young man, just like everything has been steady and the dust settles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mouth of Su Ge’s mouth showed a sardonic smile, and he said two words: "Childish."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A thick and low bell came out, and the invisible sound wave of the moment broke out in all directions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be careful!" These four people are also considered to be in battle, and immediately feel the crisis and prop up the psionic shield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In silence, the Psionic Shield and the Sonic Blade cancel each other out, The three fighters unexpectedly discovered that they had lost control of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man’s face was extremely dignified, and he took out a bottle of medicine and broke it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A burst of intense green mist instantly appeared, covering the entire road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four people did not hesitate, turned and rushed into the woods at the fastest speed and disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't run!" Several soldiers who were guarding not far away suddenly reacted and screamed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge did not chase it out, he chose to save the driver who was repairing the carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This green smoke has a violent toxin that makes Sug dizzy and sees things distorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rescued groom said with a glance: "Thank you! Thank you! Your Majesty!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Although he is also a werewolf, but he has not foreseen the poisonous thing at all. If he was not caught by the bishop in an instant, he is estimated to be dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a gust of wind blows, blowing poison gas into the distance to prevent poisoning to the surrounding horses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Griffin came face-to-face with Pete, and his face was ugly: "Please ask the bishop to punish!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge waved his hand and said in a confused way: "Not your problem, the carriage is ready to move on."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Then your body..." Griffin asked tempted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The problem is not big, just take a break."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, Su Ge Turned into the carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Su Ge entered the carriage, Erha was in a state of sorrow, and the whole body was raised and he had to chase it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The little bugs, if they are not willing, they will definitely enter the shadow city, but they will not be able to take your shot." Su Ge caressed the head of Erha Rely on the seat and close your eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That took a breath, but the problem is not big. Su Ge, who can take the potion normally, has strong resistance. He can feel that the inhaled poison gas is slowly neutralized by the poison in the body. The vertigo has just recovered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not the people of the Church of the Holy Blood, their greater willingness to catch me. It should not be for the treasure, although many people know that the sacrifice of blood is in me. In my hand, I think I have already handed over to the church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
