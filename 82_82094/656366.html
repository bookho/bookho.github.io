			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French Sini did not say too much with Su Ge, simply said a sentence and then went straight, the direction is still Beth Street, it seems that this time The goal is not Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the carriage, Su Ge thought about the meaning of Father Sini’s words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This priest, a little bit interesting." Su Ge seems to want to understand what, the mouth of the mouth reveals an interested smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half an hour, Sug has been sitting in the spacious living room and drinking aroma of black tea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke and his uncle Wright sat across from each other with a happy smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Su Ge just said that the female ghoul who had previously sacrificed Wright had been disposed of by Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a simple negotiation, Duke was anxious to bring Su Ge to a very empty room on the fourth floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a variety of things in it, which are covered by white cloth and look like an exhibition hall just closed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two did not stop and continued to move forward to the side of the table near the inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big table was wiped very clean, with some old-fashioned antiquities,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ironwork, with sculptures, weapons full of rust, and even silvery white skulls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug's eyes swept a circle, then the eyes fell directly on a dark red wooden box at the corner of the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The workmanship of the box is exquisite and elegant. Although it is worn out and worn out, it is full of the scent of the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke reached out and opened the box with a black color and a rope woven from the skin of some animal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This notebook-looking book is not only full of quaint charm, but even Su Ge feels a sense of horror and familiarity in the moment of seeing it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This special smell he only felt in a few times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once in the ancient city of Aya, once in the shadow city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because this is the atmosphere of the stars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This book has such a strong atmosphere of the stars? This atmosphere is even richer than the original moon beast, and it is faster than the darkness. The child is stunned." Su Ge was shocked at this moment, and his heart was full of vigilance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke saw the appearance of Su Ge, suddenly dignified, tempted to ask: "Mr. Black Mist, is this book so dangerous?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug immediately reached out to take the book, and did not rush to open it and asked: "No one has reminded you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge seriously said: "This book has a very strong atmosphere of the stars, this atmosphere is very dangerous for ordinary people who come into contact with it, even Fatal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" Duke carefully took a step back and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The so-called astral world is the starry sky outside this world, full of chaos and horror, monsters and evil spirits that people can't understand."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear this, Duketon’s face is dignified and the shock is undecided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge continued: "All the Yi people we know are coming from the astrology to this world. Because they are too horrible and dangerous, humans Too fragile in front of them, so protect you through the system of vision, that is, the principle of the fearlessness of those who know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Duke nodded and understood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of this world are born to know their own vision and know the meaning of the vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Under normal circumstances, those Yi people can not attack and contact ordinary humans. But if a person has too much rich astral atmosphere on the body, it is easy to attract the attention of the Yi people. At this time, the luck of this person will gradually change. Ok."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Over time, the highly corrosive astral atmosphere will gradually assimilate ordinary people, become more accessible to mystery, and finally Even the self becomes a mysterious part. At that time, the rules of the vision will be completely time-consuming, and the Yi people who are attracted will come to the moment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speaking of this, Su Ge looked at him with deep meaning: "As for the results, I don't have to say more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Duke Suddenly, I hit a spirit, and I was afraid after a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my heart, I suddenly remembered that Duke suddenly found out that Su Ge was right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This batch of goods has indeed encountered a lot of bad luck along the way, whether it is escorts and others will always experience a lot of unnecessary trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Uncle Wright, who is in charge of this shipment, came to the capital in advance for this reason, but was attacked by ghouls...<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Duke’s eyes look like a devil looking at the books in Su Ge’s hands: “Mr. Black Mist, can you help me with this book? Even if It’s OK to take it away! I don’t want a penny.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s palm touched the written special black skin, which gave a cold The feeling, even the faint meaning of squirming, feels smooth but gives a special kind of nausea and horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like the Su Ge membrane is not the skin, but some things under the skin, such as the brain of a certain creature...<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge was very rude to handle the breath of the book for a simple treatment, and then helped Duke to identify and deal with other antiques in detail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After clearing the three curses and the agate with parasitic worms, at the preparation of Duke, Suge walked out of the villa and sat in the front yard. In the beautiful garden, while enjoying the soft aroma, enjoy the bright and warm sunshine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
