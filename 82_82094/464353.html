			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green did not answer directly, but said with a little irony: "The courage of Bishop Sotos is really big, not only in the church, but also in the church." And dare to shelter the witch!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benedict replied with no humbleness: "The Pope is the true apostle of God, and he has mercy on me." The witch, to identify the nature of the witch, to understand the persecution and conspiracy of the Holy See for the witch. With great wisdom, great courage, great compassion to protect me, etc., give us salvation and home."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp When it comes to it, Bernice looks up and looks at Green for the first time. He asks seriously and solemnly: "You are highly respected in the mysterious world, and you should be very clear about the nature of our witches. Now why set up a church to protect the witch, why are you so sardonic! ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green heard this and suddenly came to the interest, he did not expect this little witch to have such courage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Looking out, you respect him very much." Although Bernice is still calm at this time, Green can feel the anger of this little witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benedict has a serious expression and a strong tone: "Yes! The Lord gives us the light of redemption, and the Pope is the leader who leads us. Your Majesty is My heart is tall and sacred. If someone humiliates him, even if it is broken, I have to maintain the authority of His Majesty!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not afraid that I killed you!? Green sat up slightly, like a waking tiger, and the horrible pressure gradually released. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;British face is a little pale, but the expression is still firm, reluctantly replied: "The authority of the arm is not tolerated, even if the wise ahead is a dead end, I have no regrets." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stop, Bernice said with great conviction: "I, I am already aware!!!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Early consciousness... early consciousness..." These four words, with unquestionable firmness and perseverance, hit the depths of Green's soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I have realized it... that..." Green remembered her eldest daughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was his hesitation, indecision, and her death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Green was silent for a minute, then he looked up and asked: "Conditions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Pope said, you need to owe him a big favor. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's the situation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A person who is confronted with the church." The silk forehead oozes fine sweat, and the beautiful face is full of seriousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, Green was silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benedict is not talking, waiting quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of such a big man in the true sense, you can't say a word more, you must use every sentence to be just right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;笃...笃...笃...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of a finger tapping the desktop is rhythmic. The large study room is very spacious and bright, but it is inexplicably suppressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why do I believe in him? Or why do I believe in you?" After about ten seconds, Green's heavy voice rang again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bennis said truthfully: "I can't make you believe me because of what I am, but I need to tell you that the incident in Bain City is that The Lord lowered the miracle and killed the son of the Mori Black Goat, saving the people of the entire city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the desktop hits, Green The dark eyes shimmered with the majestic light: "But you will still see the cults after all. A church that dares to accept witches is destined to be unrecognizable in this world, and even become an enemy of all forces."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benedicts for a few seconds, not to be outdone: "The world has always been speaking by fists, and the talents with enough fists have enough voice, we are now fists Not big, but in the future, our fists will become very big."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who gives you confidence?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My lord, and the Pope!" When it comes to this, Bernice is head-on, a hero from her Voice came, quickly filled the entire study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the straight waist of Bernice, Green's eyes were slightly bright, and he suddenly found that this little witch, no matter how courageous, discouraged, confident and knowledge, far exceeded her expectations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He still did not directly agree: "Your weight is not enough, let Suger Sotos come over and talk to me."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bennis listened and nodded: "No problem, I will inform the Pope. If you agree, you can meet with you tonight."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tonight? He is in the Imperial City?" Green Brow picked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bern City and the Imperial City are far apart, even if it is a church steamship, it takes 26 hours. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bennis shook his head: "If you want to see you, you will naturally see you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp When I heard this, Green felt a little curious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has been paying attention to the legendary bishop for a long time, but this concern is not appreciation, but hostility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He once judged that this rising church star is likely to become a tough enemy of his future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after contacting Bernice today, he discovered that this long-awaited imaginary enemy is actually a potential ally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the bravery and loyalty of Bernice, he is looking forward to the young man who is only 25 years old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will wait for him, you...can continue to travel with Tracy," Green said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bennis listened to a long breath: "Thank you for your understanding."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Outside the study, Bernice wiped the sweat from his forehead and relaxed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you okay?" For the state of Bernice, Tracy is not unexpected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She also had some friends before, and it was like this after talking to her father. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after that, she never saw those friends again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You won't see me again?" Tracy pulled the hand of Bernice and whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bennis took her back and smiled and replied: "Do not worry, the Marquis promises us to continue to be good friends."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really!?" Trishington was excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bennis nodded: "The Marquis adults know the book and feel my sincerity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to the turn, Tsui West opened the door and said loudly: "Thank you father!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green said with a look of love: "Go! Find a good one." It’s not easy for a friend, you have to cherish it.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Uh-huh!” Tsui’s chicken nodded like a glutinous rice and ran out happily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green looked at the door that was closed, put down the book, got up and turned to look out the window, his brow was locked: "Sug Sotos... Soto Where did this surname appear?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bern City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle last night caused a lot of trouble, and Su Ge once again became the focus of celebrities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle of the heroic and god-like postures of Sugera was spread through the survivors and spread throughout the night in the entire city of Bain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road family disappeared, everyone disappeared, and assets were recovered by the government. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one mentioned, no one said more, just as everyone has forgotten this family, the strange indifference and forgetting, the scalp numb . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug read the newspaper and sighed: "Is this the god of the gods? It affects so many people."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sitting opposite him, Jerouss held a glass of wine with a hint of light smile on his lips. His expression was full of enjoyment and comfort: "Normal, offering sacrifices to the gods is the most dangerous mysterious ceremony."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug recalls the essence of that star, and secretly says: "Do I also want to get some of the monsters of the Dai, let them be my messengers or pets? Higher."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wang! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to have felt Su Ge’s thoughts. The second haha, who was playing with the red puck on the ground, immediately looked up and yelled at Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You!? No, your face is the same, a little deterrent can't get off, it only makes people laugh!" Su Ge has no mercy Said the truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗷呜呜...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second time was very sad, and he was hit hard on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss looked at the second look and smiled better: "This dog is a good dog, you have to cherish it."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled: "I know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A chat for a while, Su Ge is saying: "I have already confirmed this. The root of the second witch is in the misty mountains. There will be an ancient city in the mountains. It should be a place to sacrifice to the ancient gods, and it is also likely to be the position of the Holy Grail of the soul."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Misty Mountains? I remember there was a city there, but the city disappeared 80 years ago because of the collapse of the mountain." Gerlos touched his chin and sank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Asian City, a city built in the misty mountains. I When I first tried it, I saw the disaster just as I passed by.” Gerlos’s voice is still calm, but it’s no longer the cold and sound of the past, the low and hoarse voice, with subtle fluctuations, full of special magnetic . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly, curiously asked: "Master Gerlos, is this scorpion born to be so magnetic?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
