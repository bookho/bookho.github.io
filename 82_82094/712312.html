			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These words "You don't deserve!" are constantly echoing around the ears of all clergy, and can't be dispersed for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We...do not match!?" Laurie’s face gradually squirmed as if he had suffered a huge humiliation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The mad cultist! You have to pay the price of life for everything you say today!" The one-eyed bishop is screaming, and the tone is full of threats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge did not care about the feelings of the three archbishops, eyes still watching the flame dominator, and asked: "What do you think?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame dominator listened to Su Ge’s calm tone and respect for himself, and did not let him produce emotions similar to the three archbishops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although he felt uncomfortable in his heart, he did not show it. Life and death are not in the shape of color. This is the basic quality of being a true superior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of Su Ge’s question, the flame dominator calmly replied: “It’s not the one you said, but the holy grail. Your side’s words are for us. It doesn't make any sense."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge puts his hand down and says, "That is, communication failed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The flame dominator nodded: "Everyone in the church at night can never walk out of the capital again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finished, his glazed eyes Suddenly burning a horrible flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, Michelle yelled: "screening!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, All the vampires slammed forward at the same time, blocking in front of a werewolf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, all the vampires began to burn fiercely, and the strange flames burned from these vampires, like these people spontaneously ignited. The same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the horror knowledge at the dominator level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I kill you, what are you doing with you? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vampire with strong self-healing ability in the body burned quickly, and it quickly became a group of black meat balls that could not be seen clearly. A creature that is only cooked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a species of the ancestor vampire." Seeing these seemingly wolf-black meat balls, the flame dominator said faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his voice coming out, these blackened meat balls began to squirm quickly, accompanied by a lot of blood rushing, the meat balls changed rapidly, less than half Minutes of time, it turned into a powerful, mysterious vampire, and it looked completely restored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This phenomenon can't be called self-healing, but reborn! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scene is terrifying and even incredible for other clergy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, in cognition, only high vampires can't be killed by conventional means, and ordinary vampires are labeled as this, and should have died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No wonder Hal did not leave directly after the shot, he is sheltering his Dai through his blood." The Archbishop suddenly said suddenly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the flame dominators said, these vampires are the first ancestor vampire species. Through this relationship, the life and death of these vampires is not in their own control. But it is entirely controlled by Hal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as Hal is concerned, Hal does not want them to die, it is difficult for others to kill these Yi people completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this process consumes a lot of energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the first attack, the Flame Dominator did not immediately launch a second wave of horrific attacks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, the dominator is still human. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the vampires are born again, the priests around them quickly gather the encirclement, and a horrible spirit can burst out of their bodies, it seems to have Prepare a wide range of attacks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of this psionic fluctuation, the people at the church in the late night did not dare to have too many moves because they were deterred by a dominator at this time. Like a flock of sheep lions, no one dares to move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adult!" Jean was a little anxious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Sugg slowly raised his head: "Come."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call... ...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the dark clouds, a little cold wind blew. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is light, you can clearly see that these cold winds are actually black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This wind is very large in size, even covering all clergy in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being blown by this wind, many clergymen only felt that the body was a little cold, and did not feel other problems, just like the cold night wind in the middle of the night, and Not worthy of the attention of these people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as I move on, a sinner suddenly turns around and suddenly finds that his partner’s nose is bleeding a lot of blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under waiting for him to remind his companions, he also felt that two warm liquids flowed out of the nose and descended to the ground along the chin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's the matter!?" It's not just these two people who are bleeding, but all the clergy who are present. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though the three archbishops of Laurie felt awkward at this time, they were keenly aware that their lives seemed to be accelerating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost instantaneously, the three men propped up the sanctuary of the sheltered March, barely resisting this strange thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strange cold wind is still blowing, accompanied by the constant blowing of the wind Moving, people faintly smelled a special smell from the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very unpleasant smell of rust, which is accompanied by a slow decay and death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smell this smell, everyone in the Church of the Holy Blood becomes very ugly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smell is familiar to them. This special rust smell is the oxidized taste produced by a large amount of blood piled up and dried up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the general carry-on is a special professional who comes out of the bloody maze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are more familiar with coagulation and bloodletters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the church’s current coagulation and bloodletters are missing. But the top executives know that coagulation is now in Bain, and bloodletters seem to be constantly moving around the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't the bloodletters turn to the church in the evening!" All of them trembled in their hearts, and even their inner beliefs collapsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, this time the flame dominator slowly looked up and said: "It is not a bloodletter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp When I heard this, everyone was relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it..." The sacred archbishop seemed to feel something, and looked up with the flame dominator. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dark night sky, the black wind is still drifting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in this dark night sky, a person floats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A huge black trowel was held in his arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big black robe wandered with the wind hunting, accompanied by the robe unfolding, and the Archbishop of the Wind saw the words and patterns on the robe that were incomparably beautiful and difficult to understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continue to look down, the mad wind archbishop's face brush turned pale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because on the left chest of the robe, he saw the badge belonging to the church of the late bell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cough and cough......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time the clergy on the ground have begun to weaken the cough Hey, many people start to feel dizzy and have difficulty breathing. It seems to be in a high altitude reaction. The whole person's blood must be coagulated and stop flowing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lauri looked up and looked at the figure in the sky, his eyes gradually widened: "Why... why are you!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Spirit Church is completely different from a group of werewolves and vampires. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After seeing this black robe, all the werewolves and vampires flashed a relaxed, peaceful look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the mountains that have been pressing on their heads have disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Withless countless black winds in silence, the black robe with a sickle fell from the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He came to Su Ge and bowed to Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Mill, Jean, Michelle and other werewolf vampires also said: "See the apocalypse apostle."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This shadow nodded slightly: "Do your job."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear this hoarse voice, these two hundred people are serious at the same time Nodding, the heart is filled with peace of mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was some dignity on the face of the flame dominator. He looked at the black robe and whispered: "I never dreamed that you and I will meet again. Actually, it is such a force field, such a look."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black robe turned and looked at the flame dominator, and a smirk under the hood: "I also Some didn't expect to meet you here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge asked: "Do you know? Death Apostle?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The death apostle nodded slightly: "We are classmates. We studied together in the Holy Blood Maze. In the experience, he succeeded, so he went out of the maze and went to the Star Heaven. And I failed and became a maze. Guard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you heard the maze guarding the words, all the clergymen turned pale, and then instantly realized the identity of the black man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the flame dominator said, he is not a bloodletter, but he is a blood coagulator! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coagulator, maze guard: Walter! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serving the March goddess, guarding the maid of the blood maze, the only coagulator of the Holy Blood Maze, actually betrayed the Church of the Holy Blood and joined the church of the late bell! ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hearing such news, all clergy are stupid at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stupid people are not just clergy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the pub, the representatives of many forces face each other, and their faces are unbelievable. They look dull and look at the two churches who are drinking the evening bell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time Lance, Petite Woman, Hills, Vigania, Moore, Serena, six people sitting together, said each other It’s very easy to laugh, it doesn’t seem to care about the outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The six people noticed the horror of everyone, and this moment suddenly made the vanity of Hills and Vegniya a great satisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sears said inscrutablely: "French Water has been threatened by nightmares for countless years. The hypocritical church of the Holy Blood will only give him shackles and sufferings, but he will never be redeemed. The Master of the Bell discovered Father Water. The extraordinary and painful, and then led it to the kingdom of my Lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After many tests, Father Water has received the approval of my master, Under the blessing of my Lord, I not only got rid of the entanglement of nightmares, but even with the knowledge given by my Lord, I entered the level of dominance and became one of the apostles of my Lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear these words, the attention of the four people is instantly attracted to a few words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The false Church of the Holy Blood, the kingdom of God, blessing, my Lord, the apostle of my Lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For what Hills said, most of them believe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Otherwise, no one can explain how the late bell church used this method to seduce the baby of such a holy blood church so easily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, the starting point of Father Water, who was born in the blood of the Holy Blood, is already very high. If there is no benefit beyond the Church of the Holy Blood, he will not pass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Virginia took a sip of wine and said with a deep expression: "Quiet watching. Good play, just started."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not just the pubs that watch the bustle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some old churches somewhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the dilapidated bench in front of the prayer room, the two old priests were sitting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two old men are dressed in ordinary clothes, their faces are full of wrinkles and gullies, and they look no different from ordinary old people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But feel carefully and discover that they have a kindness and sacredness that no one else has. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This battle, I still haven’t had time to stop it." The old priest on the left was tired and dusty, and seemed to be rushing from afar. come back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Su Ge is there, he will definitely recognize it. This is his old acquaintance, the holy godfather who was met in the ancient city of Aya, the morning light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old priest opposite him gave him a cup of hot tea, but the wrinkled hand did not tremble. He looked deep inside the pattern glass and said: In the morning light, this battle is not something we can control."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yu Hui, Laurie and Saru asked you to go to see Meris, you Did you find anything?” asked the Holy Father morning light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This old priest, it was just a few days ago that Saru invited the past gods who had treated Merris, Yu Hui. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two are classmates and are good friends for decades. They are called the Light of Hope of the Church of the Holy Blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yu Hui whispered: "They are making gods in some way. From the current situation, they have already been made."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Morning light suddenly widened his eyes: "Are they crazy? Do they know what this means? They didn't remember the things in the Mauser fishing village!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yu Hui sighed: "I also said, but they seem to be very confident, and finally even the apostles have shot."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Are the apostles coming back?" The morning light just came back, and the situation here is still not clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The afterglow nodded: "He seems very fond of Su Ge Sotos' death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Silent morning light, whispered: "I remember I told you before, I think this apostle has a problem..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The afterglow shook some powerlessly Shaking his head: "These things are not something that we can manage. The apostle's knowledge is boundless. He is even more likely to have arrived in the mystery, beyond the immortal realm of the great sage. Even if he really has problems, we have nothing. Way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
