			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three people walked over the cordon and entered the apartment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan did not come in, and Sug did not want him to touch too many of these dark things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the way, Jack said about the experience and work of two people yesterday. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I received the case late last night, a pair of orphans were killed at home and dismembered into a quirky shape, the heart, the brain was taken away, suspected to be certain The behavior of the cultists. Yesterday I asked Roland to come over and investigate. Through the mysterious knowledge of Roland, the trace of the blood smell channel was identified in the vicinity of this generation. It is determined that the murderer has lived nearby and there is no rash action. I plan to come over to see the situation today. I didn’t expect to report that there was a death today, called Ram Ward. The two of us just came over and didn’t know the situation.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su The grid nodded slightly: "I got the news here. This Ram has not gone to work for three days. If it wasn't that he died three days ago, it means that he is holding some evil ritual for these three days. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three people walked down the stairs to the third floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ram’s room is a standard one bedroom and one living room, where the ground is full of blood, walls, and strange patterns on the ground. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brains and livers of the two orphans were placed in the four corners of the living room and were completely dry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle is Ram's body, his body curled into a meat ball, the shape looks very strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police did not dare to approach, standing at the door and not even dare to go in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seeing the body, Su Ge first opened the vision to confirm that Ram’s soul had disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jack, take these police out and stay outside," Su Ge said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack nodded and turned and walked out with a lot of police. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the police went out, Su Ge first swept a circle in the room with the night bell, and determined that there was no psychic trap, and gradually approached Ram's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be careful, I can feel that there is a lot of blood condensate in his body that accumulates in the chest, which contains very strange psionic power." Roland reminded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug, with his cane, gradually penetrated into the gap of Ram’s body, then slammed his body and opened his curled body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along with the moment when his body opened, a large number of blood-red worms spread like a group of mosquitoes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be careful! It is one of the most disgusting mysterious creatures of hemolytic parasites." Roland hurriedly reminded him that his body quickly receded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge naturally knows the nausea of ​​this thing, the right hand cold flame rises up, and all of these parasites are frozen in a flash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of insect is generally a monster that is cultivated by the human body as a nest and human blood as a nutrient. They are only mosquito-sized and can enter from the human skin or skin. In the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After being integrated into the blood, the blood is rapidly multiplied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the most terrifying thing is that they have no difference in blood and blood, and the conventional means are completely undetectable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was too late to find out that there was no blood in the patient's blood vessels, and it was filled with such insects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The low temperature of the cold flame is the nemesis of these insects. While freezing the bugs, Su Ge was frozen in the same way as Ram's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Roland’s gaze, what emerged after being burned by the flames was not the ashes, but a crystal-clear ice sculpture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is this knowledge?" Roland was surprised to see this look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge arbitrarily said: "It is not the knowledge of the profession, the effect of the secret treasure."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon hearing this, Roland immediately noticed the black gloves of Su Ge's right hand, but did not say much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Blood Bishop is a very normal thing with a strong secret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His body was temporarily placed here, then I will bring him back to the Cathedral of the Holy Blood for inspection, first look at other situations around you. Su Ge said to go to the bedroom on the inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Roland walked to the kitchen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ram’s bedroom was very messy, and newspapers, clothes, and books were thrown into the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This Ram is not a true mystery, it’s just a half-baked one, not even a career, even the apprentices are not. It is very likely that someone has misled and deliberately taught him to think that he has become a mystery."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s heart is thinking fast Sweeping around: "There should be clues here. At present, this Ram is not killing him, but the self-destruction after the failure of his own ceremony."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" On the surface, there is no clue. It is like an ordinary mysterious fan who is obsessed with mystery, but secretly..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hands on the wall, Su Ge The aftermath of the night bell was released, and the structure inside the wall of the entire room suddenly appeared in his mind through the constant reverberation of the bell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Found it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;turned to the desk and pushed the desk to the left to reveal The corner on the inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The floor in the corner has obvious signs of being opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although it is very cautious, it is too small for the police's criminal investigation ability. Even if there is no aftermath of the night clock, it takes a little time to find it." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With one finger press, the ground turns over and there is a very delicate dark space inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a black-painted notebook in the dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take the notebook and look at it, Su Ge found this is a diary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On September 15th, he said yes, I am indeed an extraordinary person, I can feel that I am different from others, I have obeyed His suggestion is that it is time to move into mystery and contribute to the revival of our race."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"September 17, his knowledge is so I am obsessed. The mysterious knowledge I knew before is just a joke about this real mystery. I have come into contact with a new world. I want to be a true mystery."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "On September 18, he said that my talent is very good. I learned blood cursing in one day. I think this is the same. I am the descendant of that one. I am different from ordinary people. I am real. Aristocrats. It is a matter of course to have such a talent. Just as there is a fool in the assembly who wants to curse others, let him use this blood curse to try the water!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this, Su Ge knows that this silly boy is Evan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On September 20th, there were people who had the same bloodline as me. They were just guys with impure bloodlines. I felt his powerful power. I feel my subtle changes. Although the vision grows a lot, everything is moving in the right direction. One day, my whole body will inherit all his power and become a sage!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On September 24th, the process of sacrifice made me fascinated. The kind of chewing heart and sucking the brain is the sound that I have heard beautiful and the most beautiful. I feel To the change of self-spirit, I have already received His favor, and my form is evolving."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On September 27, he said that he had come into contact with more The son of the child, now needs to complete more sacrifices, our great Lord will truly wake up, our race will be truly revived. He has contacted a primary school teacher through his own relationship, he and his children have already I began to wake up. He said that it is really awkward to guide them to master their own strength. Ah, when can my real power be awakened..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The "He" here should refer to the ancient god, then this "he" is Who? It should be seen that he should also be a Byron Dias, and know the truth of the matter, collecting sacrifices through these ignorant people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yesterday, the father and son were used by him, and finally lost control and became a monster. Who is this, who is this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing special about the next diary They are all spiritual experience and satisfaction with their achievements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until recently, Su Ge found the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On October 13th, I felt a little uncomfortable. He said that bloody skin is the gift of the Lord, the embarrassment of our evolution, but this feeling It’s not very good, I’m a little embarrassed, I seem to see something strange...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, Ram’s font has begun to scribble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On October 16th, I must speed up, the body of the mortal has been unable to withstand the gift of the Lord, I need to sacrifice more sacrifices, listen More sounds to stabilize me..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day's date was not finished, it was over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last time was last night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On October 17, everything is ready, tonight, I will be one with the Lord!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The next page is a scribbled picture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looks like a mountain range, the mountains are surrounded by clouds, and the shadows in the middle can see a city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After picking up the diary, Roland came over and asked, "What clues have you found?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su The grid nodded slightly: "There is a diary, let's talk about it later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The kitchen is disgusting, with lots of bloody and condensed blood, stinking." Roland said with a look of disgust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded and said, "Let's go, I know what it is all about."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Out of the apartment, Su Ge looked up at the dim sky: "Sure enough, there is a black hand in the dark, who is manipulating the situation in the city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
