			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s body does not use the Holy Grail, and it is known at the moment of integration with the Holy Grail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, at the moment of integration, Su Ge has also had a very comprehensive understanding of the Holy Grail of the Soul, and his ability is more thoroughly understood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, Su Ge’s plan was already calculated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He does not push the Holy Grail through the flesh, but through the body of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The form of the body of death is very advanced, and has even approached the demigod. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time he spurred the body of death, on the one hand, deterrence, on the other hand, to test the fit of the body of death and the Holy Grail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The results made him very satisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So after the second death, he directly launched his only manipulation of the Holy Grail today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a huge space in the Holy Grail of the Soul, where there are countless souls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But his ability does not control those souls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at the same time, the Holy Grail of the Soul can also be used as a door, a key, or a medium. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge dominates the Holy Grail of the Soul with the body of death, with the cold flame as a sacrifice and medium, through its particularity linked to the hunter god country with the same attributes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And through the kingdom of God, summoned the madness of the whole country of God to the low level, the souls who were not redeemed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Su Ge has a more advanced form and psionic power, he can even summon the knights of the Kingdom of God through the Holy Grail of the Soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, today’s Su Ge is far from that degree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, he reluctantly summoned the thousands of lowest-level souls with the entire body of death and the cost of 80% of the psionic power of the shark potion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is a low level, it is accompanied by hoarfrost and is a presence in the Kingdom of God. The combat effectiveness is still very good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of Su Ge's death is broken directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, countless souls surround his body, open his mouth, and frantically crush all the imprisonment on his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body returns to normal, Su Ge slightly moves the body, looking at it, the entire hill has become snowy, into the cold winter environment, the air has reached zero Thirty degrees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sky, black feathers have turned into a horrible blizzard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this blizzard, countless horrible evil spirits are constantly flying and madly attacking all the living. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a scream, there were already more than a dozen clergymen killed by these evil spirits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Quickly use silver ash! These are spiritual creatures!" The dark star screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are the elites of the church, and they immediately took out the silver ash and smeared them on the weapons and began a difficult counterattack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No! Too much! They are too much!" Several clergymen yelled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Father is holding a big book at this time, and two big hands appear in the big book, easily crushing a large number of souls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laury is also killing the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Word uses the Purification of the Word to continually purify. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three eyes constantly attacking the top of the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grave guards waved the shovel and ate the soul after killing it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light of the Aurora is still sharp, and all the souls that have been attacked have become light particles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The caged person did not move, and the souls around him fell into the ground like iron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Too much! Gather the formation!" At this time, Laurie shouted, and everyone quickly gathered and hugged into a circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Father did not move, and the frozen body was shaking, but he was motionless, his face was firm and moving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, Ryan, who was in the form of fire, came to him and dispelled the cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley looked at the scenes of the group's magical dance but was not happy: "These things are not lethal to this strong, only delay some time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly: "I know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, he took out a black in his arms Like the horn made of horns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is... call the dragon flute!?" Shelley was shocked to see this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Geen snorted and put the horn on his lips and blew it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beep toot...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A strange, low-pitched voice sounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This voice is not big, even many people in the snow have not heard, let alone other people in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this sound has an infinite penetrating power that can be transmitted through space to far and far distances. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snow and soul continue, and with the passage of time, the soul is quickly eliminated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outsider is now able to return to God from the horror scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They don't know what has just happened, and it seems that something important has been forgotten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they return to God, those snows and souls have already appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How many years have passed! The new situation has finally been opened!" Laojiao looked at the top of the mountain and said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mur frowns: "The soul is really weird, but it only delays the time. It has now been wiped out. If he does not have a backhand, he will lose." No doubt."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man laughed and didn't speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, Su Ge has given them too many surprises, and then come up with some means, they are not surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The director of the school clenched his fist: "I can see that I really need to ask the principal to go out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp For a time, all the students were excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the situation is not so good! He will be caught in this way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The discerning eye has seen the problem here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no one dares to talk more, can only wait silently, waiting for Su Ge to have any other backhand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After ten minutes, the blizzard subsided and thousands of souls were wiped out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clerics on the top of the mountain are almost dead. The previous fifty people, there are more than a dozen people left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time everyone's face is incomparably ugly, gloomy staring at Su Ge, incomparably angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I killed you!" The dark star is distorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just, he died several friends and subordinates! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three archbishops are also very bad, and their hearts are full of anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Father’s face is also full of sorrow. Those people are his good children and are the elite of the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger held Shirley in his arms at this moment, his attitude was indifferent, and he said, "I said, don't treat my kindness to you. The capital you put down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three bishops are gloomy, and Laurie’s face is gloomy: “This time, no one can keep you!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, the rush of the rush. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge chuckles and says: "Yes!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell...< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咔嚓! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky suddenly remembered a thunderous thunder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, Laurie felt the inspiration burst, and a feeling of immediate death suddenly came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instantly, he turned into a black mist and disappeared in the same place using the most important means of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a horrible crash, it seems that something huge has fallen from the sky into the mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lyan’s eyes widened at this time: “This...this is impossible, it’s impossible!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The dust and gravel gradually dissipated, and the remaining clergymen were extremely ugly, even watching the things in front of them in fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, between them and Su Ge, a sword was inserted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sword is at least five meters long, the hilt is one and a half meters long, the blade has two blades, and there is a gap in the middle. The tuning fork is somewhat similar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sword is full of scale-like reliefs, full of an indescribable quaint atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, at the end of the hilt, there is still a horrible current that is completely dissipated, with a terrible horror deterrent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is!!!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this sword, the three archbishops are incomparably Frightened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, everyone suddenly felt that the sky was blacking down, as if there was something huge to cover the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In curiosity, they instinctively looked up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calling! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning, a horrible gust of wind blew from the sky and swept the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind blows people down, even a few students are not standing and being blown out, hitting a distant house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horrible wind blew the sand from the entire city, full of smoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, a horrible roar sounded, the whole city was like an earthquake, and the ground even cracked and rolled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What the hell is going on!" Many clergymen are busy at this time to stabilize their bodies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All students can’t touch their minds, don’t know what’s going on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And those masters are completely stupid at this time, their eyes are full and sluggish, as if they have seen the most incredible things in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am stupid... I am stupid..." Daddy and many people muttered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They just thought that Su Ge would come up with any means that wouldn’t surprise them, and wouldn’t surprise them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at this point, they found themselves too naive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dust gradually dissipated, and on the top of the mountain, people saw a pair of horrible eyes like the size of the house in the dust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These eyes exude a golden glow like the sun, and the pair of erect squats with high scorn, as if a god is looking down on a worm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next person waited until the dust dissipated, and suddenly found that on the side of the mountain, another big mountain appeared at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can be further dispersed with dust...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pump! thump! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the people linger on the ground one after another. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face is pale, his eyes are sluggish, his mouth is constantly squirming, and he can’t speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if some timid people fainted directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I must be dreaming...must be."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless people smirking, 掐With your own legs, hit your face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After severe pain tells them that this is not a dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, on the edge of the mountain, standing a dragon! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This dragon stands there for a full 300 meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wings that cover the sky are now gathered on both sides of the body, and the two-meter-long horrible tail sweeps slightly, causing the entire ground to constantly Shock, the house collapsed, and the landslide broke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sun, its bronze-colored scales each have a washbasin size, neatly and closely attached together, sparkling with the icy glare of metal, letting people It looks as thick as a mountain and stronger than steel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sky, the clouds are foggy and the thunder is flashing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the top of the mountain, the priests were not moved by the eyes, and the horrible dragon shrouded everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
