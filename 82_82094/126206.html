			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time came at four o'clock, two people circled two circles in the wilderness outside the city, sure that they were not tracked by anyone, and did not cause any attention, 拎Two boxes quickly entered the factory to pick up the witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the cold reservoir, when Bart walked in, a layer of hoarfrost appeared on the eyebrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this a place where people can survive?" Bart's frozen trembling in thick leather. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge walked over as usual and said, "Is it cold here? It doesn't feel much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Bart's face was unexpected, the previous step was pinched on Su Ge's clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn, your clothes are not as thick as my autumn clothes. Are you sure that your perception is not a problem?" Bart looked unbelievable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Apostle, who is this?" In the dark, as the lights lit up, Bart heard a cold, hostile, cold voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart heard the sound and turned to see two beautiful women wearing thin clothing and barefoot on the ground below zero. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the well-informed Barton was open, his eyes widened and he looked at the two men, and the brain could not turn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug stood next to the two women and said with a smile: "We are all believers in the storm and death, my lord blazes and blizzards, He Believers can receive the protection of theocracy, so that we are not afraid of the cold."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪嗒! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, Bart found that his vision had risen a bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Quiet! Calm!" As an expert level mystery, Bart has a good quality of heart and tolerance for unknown fears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of such a situation, he quickly returned to calm, just a look of horror, like a book, just back to normal in the blink of an eye, the invisible people watching I want to laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge said here: "This one is Bart Inbas, he is my partner and a trustworthy friend. I entrusted him to help you solve the problem of identity. This time I came to pick you up into the city. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, there was a burst of excitement and joy on both of Hills’ faces, and grateful to Suge: "Thank you. "Apostle adults."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Apostles? Sure enough!" Hearing the title, Bart’s heart was secret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The apostle, this title is unusual in religion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, the entire religious pope is the pinnacle of rights, closest to the existence of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the apostles are a special case. They are not very high in identity and have little rights. But their relationship with God is much higher than that of the Pope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because they represent the gods walking in the world, they represent the will of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Pope of almost all churches today is born out of the apostles, so that the purity of religion can be guaranteed to the greatest extent." Bart's heart is secret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of Bart’s contemplation, Sug turned his head and said, “There are your new clothes here, along with your relevant identity documents and past resumes. "You have to change clothes first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two men took the box with a heart, and said in the heart: "I can finally dedicate our strength to my Lord." After br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that, Su Ge walked out with Bart and let the two men change their clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart stood outside and confirmed again: "I can temporarily put both of them in my union. What are your plans?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge sighed and said: "For the time being, I will have a generous salary after I become a formal cleric, and then I will receive them as a family maid. Come home."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart listened with satisfaction and nodded: "Exactly, we have also invested in a maid agency. I have done a simple job for them recently. Training, after the time is ripe, you will receive both of them from your home through this intermediary."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge nodded and said, "Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The next period of time is not safe, do you need the guards of both of them?" Bart asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s hand touched the still tingling skin on his neck and whispered: “I will inform them when needed, and help them hide when they arrive. Identity is good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bar Features: "No problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Both Erns and Bernice walked out inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two people wearing plain blue woven dresses, wearing thick gray cotton coats on the outside and wearing furry boots on their feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wearing a cotton hat on his head and wearing thick plush gloves on his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two heavy boxes in their hands, which seem to be two simple villagers who have just entered the city from the countryside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Perfect!" Seeing this, Su Ge's face was satisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bennis was very satisfied with this low-key dress and turned to Bart Dachel: "Thank you for your clothes, Mr. Bass."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hills’s mouth always said with a strange smile: “Yes, because Mr. Bass, this dress is very suitable for us.”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hills's smile is so splendid and sincere, but it is because of the strange curvature of the corner of the mouth, always giving a creepy feeling (reference cover). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart’s expression is a bit stiff and nodded, “Get on the bus first!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bennis Without anxious, he turned to look inside and asked: "What about these traces of life? Apostles adults?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug turned and asked: "Can help me burn "What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart sighed helplessly: "If my master knows, I will not forgive me."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said, walked into the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looked at his back and said with a smile: "The color of your flame is enough to forgive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Apostle, is this man trustworthy? I feel that his heart is very messy." Hills, who is good at understanding the people, whispers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled and said: "Reassured, he has already seen the power of my Lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Recalling this, the two witches suddenly became clear and confident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being a deterrent, there is no courage to betray! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half a minute, Bart calmly said: "All done."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cautious Bernice was not at ease, turned and walked in to look at it, and then found that there was nothing in it at that time, like the body of the past, the stove and so on did not exist, and there was no sign of someone who had ever lived. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The apostle is so powerful, the partners are so powerful." Bernice is full of admiration and respect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sitting in the carriage returning to the city, Hills sees two people With his own identity document, he silently recited his past false experience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name of Hills is now Sarah Guman, the daughter of a worker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bennis’s name is Mary Ferros, a descendant of a noble aristocrat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people are sisters who have fled together. Two people have been here for two months. Through hard work, they have obtained proof of residence and registration of their household registration. Residents of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, there are a lot of unreasonable things in it, but this has already been done by Bart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
