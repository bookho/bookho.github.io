			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the back of the youth, Su Ge was a little cautious and turned and asked: "Do you know him?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Milla shook his head: "I don't know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug did not continue to delve into this topic and instead asked: "You recently Are there any weird dreams? Or what a weird sense of oppression?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mella shook his head: “There is no special reaction, just In this clinic, I can live this safe life all the time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge looks around this seemingly ordinary clinic and suddenly asks: "You Do you know what it feels like to be a god?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mella heard this look, shook his head in silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All things are omniscient. Everything in the world is no longer important." Su Ge said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Milla looked at Su Ge’s dark, deep eyes: “The gods are too heavy for us, and the existence itself should not be in harmony with humans.” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But after the intersection, the cause and effect of this can't be undone." Saige turned and prepared to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mella did not say much, nor did she stop it. She seemed to be instinctively jealous of excessive contact with Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh yes, have you heard such a passage?" Su Ge said suddenly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before the dim bonfire, the young scholars sat next to the tired body. The old scholars who had arrived had put down their thoughts and said to each other. After the old man, or after a smile, young scholars got up and left, continuing their future. Looking for their hope and light in a desperate and dark world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mella brows and wrinkles, without talking and falling into meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge slightly sideways, looking at Myra, said: "This has nothing to do with life and death, it is only about your initial will and commitment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mylar looked up and looked at Su Ge with a special look in a pair of green eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remember the initial heart has always been."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, Su Ge has closed the door. Leaved the clinic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mella slowly sits on the chair and holds the mop handle slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A moment of silence, she followed the stairs back to the study on the second floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a dark room full of books, she took out a thick book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This book seems to be some kind of classic, huge and heavy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outer cover is made of special metal with boring text. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the text, you can see that there is a scene in the vagueness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scene is a city full of Gothic architecture and graves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the city, there are three bright moons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Slowly flipping through the books, a burst of unspeakable power accompanied by the opening of the title page and stirred around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is surprising, however, is that there is no text on the pages of this huge book, and it is empty like a new book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mella bit his finger and drip his blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the blood being absorbed, this huge book squirmed like alive, and then there were countless blood-red scenes and words on the pages of the book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Normal people can’t understand those scenes and words at all, but Myra is deeply attracted to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Those people in the moonlight, what kind of story can you leave in this blood-contaminated book? The power of ancient times has been flowing in the blood for countless years. Which one of you is this?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, she turned over the first page and looked at the content. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This page is a tall man in a black robe, holding a broken sword with a cheekbones mask. He stood in the bones and blood pool, surrounded by deep fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can see that he is full of scars, and even the body can't stand. However, he is still as straight as a javelin, looking up at the three rounds of the moon in the sky, with the shackles and unyielding in the depths of the human soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it a rebellious brave man with a big sword in the blurry text?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;After finishing, she turned another page. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This page is a petite woman, she is standing on the bloody sea of ​​the corpse, the scales on the body have been broken. A hand-held sword, a hand-held gun. She is also looking up, but she looks up to the stars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you going to tear the pages of the book to the end of the ideal, into the king of confusion and despair?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Then she turned another page. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This page is full of distortions, the whole world is in blood red, just like hell on earth. One form is inhuman, the presence of the scepter is on the ground, and the eyes that are bigger than the head are distorted and look at the sky, seemingly watching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it also abandoning reason, embracing madness, and twisting the devil to the truth outside the world?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this, Myramoth's closing book, turned his head through the window, just to see Su Ge's hands in his trouser pockets, strolling leisurely into the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When those people are busy pursuing so-called justice, the so-called roots, proving self-power and existence, a simple person is in a brick, Efforts to maintain this long-stained world, comforting those souls who lost themselves in sweet blood and twisted nightmares."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sug Sotos, are you the one in the book?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At noon, Su Ge returned home with a steam locomotive, Betty has done Good lunch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Niya has gone?" Su Ge found that Niya is no longer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Betty nodded: "Well, the big guy of the steam union came to pick her up, and I sneaked out and looked at it. The scene was spectacular."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have a good night's sleep after dinner, and there will be more things tonight." Su Ge said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley did not object, reminded: "You have to be careful, my recent inspiration tells me that something bad is about to happen."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge heard it very unexpectedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Things that touched Shirley’s inspiration, it must be a big deal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will pay attention." Su Ge is still very confident about his own means. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, in the church of the West Branch of the Church of the Holy Blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saru Bishop sat behind his desk and stood in front of three people. The three-person group officially transferred from Bain City, Roland, Father Anthony and Mother Marlene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I received the news that tonight, the people who are ignoring the church will attack the home of a wealthy businessman and steal his deformed son. You are responsible for the protection in secret. At the same time kill the goddess of the goddess."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three people nodded after listening: "Understand!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, let's go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three turned and left, did not pay attention to the coldness in the eyes of Archbishop Dasalu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the corridor of the church, Roland whispered: "I always feel that something big has happened recently. We should be careful tonight."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
