			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge did not respond to their anger, not even looking at those clergy who were red-faced and angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, he calmly and calmly puts his hair in a meticulous manner and put on a top hat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting up with a cane and standing up, it seems like a learned professor who just finished class and is ready to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Father followed and stood up and said seriously: "I sincerely hope that you can stay, I will guarantee with my reputation and belief, you will not make any "Things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge greeted him slightly: "You are a true cleric, approaching the saint's existence, I believe in you." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Father had some relief on his face after listening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But I don't believe in the March church." Su Ge added a cold and indifferent way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Father’s brow is slightly wrinkled, and there are some puzzles: “I can guarantee your safety, guarantee your freedom, you have so much knowledge, the church will definitely Pay attention to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looked at the real saint and turned to look at other clerics and said: "Some things you don't need to know, Because they will tarnish your eyes and your heart."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No evidence, don't mess around! You are now a traitor to the church, a pagan! You are not qualified to comment Church!" At this time, Horace yelled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge slightly sideways, looked at the bald-headed disgusting middle-aged man, with a sardonic smile on his lips, asking the Holy Word: "You need Evidence? Archbishop?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Words are not good at this time, and the tone is cold and cold: "Yes, the reputation of the church in March is not to be defiled." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just Su Ge’s continuous arrogant words made them very angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded and looked directly at the Holy Word and asked: "Cure the church to come to the two bishops here, why is there only one left?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The singer whispered: "Bishop Jenny was killed by the cold-hearted church in order to protect the camp."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you sure you were killed by the cold-hearted church?" ?" Su Ge seems to smile and smile, look at Horace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Horace’s heart trembled twice, and his expression was even more gloomy: “The person who will die still wants to leave the church, damn it!”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, ready to launch psionic power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Word faintly felt the change of Horace, faintly said: "Stop."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Horace listened to the hurried stop gesture and returned to calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug continued: "Cure churches have always had black robes and white robes. The two factions have long been known to the world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear that no one refutes, the cure of the church is really noisy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Bishop of Horace belongs to the Black Robe Healing Church, and Bishop Jenny belongs to the White Robe Healing Church. Recently, Bishop Jenny has developed too fast, naturally causing some people. Uneasy and malicious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, everyone’s heart moved and thought of a possibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s mouth continues with sarcasm: “The first time I went up the mountain, the church’s configuration was very strange. The bishop of Mount Horas will belong to Bishop Jenny. The squadrons were all taken away, and their own squadrons were left behind."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having heard this, everyone faintly saw Horace without a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every bishop has its own squadron is recognized by the church, because only the squadron can play a more powerful combat under the leadership of the bishop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the battlefield, the most taboo is to carry out the exchange of troops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because mysterious cooperation requires high-precision, high-density exercises, a slight mistake can cause huge problems, and rashly change the commander, that is to find death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Horace wanted to explain, but was stunned by the dark golden eyes of the Holy Father. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug continued: "What’s even more interesting is that according to what our people saw and heard at the time, when the cold church came to rob the camp, it seemed to have In response to the night hawks church's backhand, the butcher's means, the butchers were directly frozen as soon as they appeared, as if they had known the butcher's existence in advance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Everyone looked at the butcher again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butcher nodded slightly: "It’s really weird, they really have been prepared."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heard In this case, the clergy began to sink in the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Horace oozes a thin layer of sweat on his forehead, and his fists under his sleeve keep moving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug continued: "It’s also interesting that in the defensive war, the people who cured the church would have stood behind, as the priest’s Bishop Jenny. In the front, she was constantly attacked. Then she left without any hesitation, any mess, no one even objected, and one person looked at Jenny. They just threw the precious master priest there. Death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear this, the sages take a deep breath, and the eyes of the gods obviously feel a burst of anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug did not continue to talk, looking at the Holy Father and asking: "The situation you have seen, how do you let me believe in you?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Father looked at the sweaty face, and his pale face was full of grief, as if he saw his parents’ disabled parents, and they were so sad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I respect you, but your nobleness does not represent the nobleness of the March church." Su Ge finished, turned and prepared to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stand up!" At this time, the three archbishops stood up at the same time, staring at Su Ge's face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the conversation, they found that Suge had mastered too much information and knowledge they needed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now he can't let him go anyway, and he will definitely let him die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge slightly sideways, his eyes flashing cold and cold: "It means, you ignore my last warning, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;枭 took a deep breath and said seriously: "Suge, I hope you can understand our behavior."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saint The speaker did not speak and bowed his head. At this time, he felt a little embarrassed about Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge snorted: "Sure enough, a group of ungrateful white-eyed wolves. I know so, I really shouldn’t let my people venture to open the door and release you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear this, everyone is shaking inside, and the expression is full of struggles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people are long-lasting, ungrateful, and those who feel that doing bad things are a minority. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being able to survive in that desperate environment, they are very grateful to the help of the Church of the Night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, they really have no way, they can’t violate their beliefs and can’t betray their own church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Father turned his head and looked at the three archbishops, and looked at the priests who were surrounded by arrogance, and stunned his eyes as if he had been deceived by an adult. The innocent child looks so pitiful and helpless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few seconds after silence, he bowed deeply to Su Ge, with deep guilt and blame in his tone: "I'm sorry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looked at the poor saint and smiled: "You are the last backbone and hope of the church, you don't need to blame yourself."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the three archbishops have come round, and Laurie said with a serious attitude: "I will not let you eat too much bitterness."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butcher looked down at the second hair that began to wander, and thought of the horrible chill it spewed out in his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he did not say much, and bowed his head to remain silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Moore stood aside and said seriously: "I hope that the three churches don't go too far."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark star scolded: "There is no place for you to talk here!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three archbishops did not even look at him. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moore pinched his fist and his face was very gloomy. Just as he was about to erupt, he saw Su Ge smile at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he was like a deflated ball, and returned to speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bells followed and said, "I know that you will not pay attention to us, but I express my views on behalf of our Elf Order. We think that we should let Sog Sotos Mr. left."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shut up!" Horace seized the opportunity and looked awkward like a mad dog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He needs to show his attitude and sin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bells glanced at Horace and sneered at him no longer, as if he saw an ugly shit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elf Order is centered on solidarity and friendliness. What they hate most is this kind of composing people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg is very comfortable at this time, because he knows that he is not alone, and not all of the world has been dyed in March. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a time, he was full of pride. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the three archbishop-level archbishops and gestured proudly: "Do you really think you are winning?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The three lords are present. If you let a master run, then you can make a big joke." Laurie said, with a wave of his hands, countless dark whistling, and instantly Su Ge Encircled, like a lot of black gold hoops, wrapped around Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thick bell came again, but Laurie was the lord after all, and the power of the night did not break the black bondage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't want to hurt you, you'd better be honest." He glanced at the butcher who looked down and said seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s indifferent answer: “When you stood in front of me, it hurt me.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! Boom! Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, and a burst of bells continued to come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After three times, this black bondage was directly broken by the night clock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Impossible! What is this knowledge!?" Seeing this, Laurie was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same shock, there are everyone else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge opened his mouth and began to sing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wu is the person who inherits the destiny, gives the soul salvation, gives the devil a soothing, gives the undead a liberation, and gives the filthy to death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am the purifier of purifying the world, the guide of the deceased, the pacifier of the evil spirit, the liberator of the devil, the pacifier of the soul, the soul of the ghost spirit The guide to the Hades, the performer of the night bell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death is my robes, the night bell is my body, the sound wave is my blade, and the soul is my people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I listen to the voice of the deceased, interpret the soul's appeal, linger in the ocean of death, take a boat in the evening bell, stroll through the abyss, and travel to and from the Hades. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn! Stop him! He is the abyss of the valley..." At this time, Ryan, who is not dead, seems to think of something, and he is shocked and said that the body appears instantly. Behind Su Ge, it is like a teleportation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The singer of Suge’s mouth sneered: “It’s an old routine.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
