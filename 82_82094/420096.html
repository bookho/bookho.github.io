			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After breakfast, Jean continued his work and left the Church of the Holy Blood with enthusiasm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bishop, what is the order?" Griffin asked Su Ge, respectfully asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug slammed the tiny dust on his shoulder: "You go to Bain University."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Your alma mater?" Griffin glimpsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly: "My good friend, a mechanical genius has been treated unfairly, not only has his scientific research been taken away, but even I was suppressed by the school. The other party seems to be a road family. Do you understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Griffin replied: "It’s still understood that the road family is open mussels. One of the original families of Encheng, which is mainly responsible for operating the banking and locomotive systems in the city, is considered to be the largest in the initial family and has the greatest power."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, Griffin smiled slightly: "But this worldly thing is only the foundation of the bottom. If the bishops need it, I can clean them up through relationships."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Su Ge fiddled with his hair and looked at himself in the mirror and said freely: "I don't want to make things big and affect the development of Bain City. I am not interested in correcting any social atmosphere, just take things that belong to my friends." Come back, by the way, let their arrogance pay a price."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Griffin is an old fritter. When he hears Su Ge, his mouth suddenly shows a deep smile: "I understand, Bishop, I will clean up." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh yes! Let Father Anthony monitor the flow of mysterious people in the city recently, believers from other places have heard the news, a lot of mysterious people are working Gathered here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Griffin flashed a glimmer of light in his eyes and nodded: "Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; After joining the church in the late bell, he had not had the opportunity to reach out to other church members, and he was curious about those who were in the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing the meter, Su Ge picked up his cane and left the Church of the Holy Blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His goal today is simple, to enter the mysterious circle of Bain City and see if you can get some information...<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bern University, as an ancient school with a long history of 120 years, has produced a batch of outstanding talents, including two mechanical masters, one central archbishop, four The master of philosophy, two masters of history, ranks in the middle of the empire, and can rank in the upper middle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gate of the school, the dark iron gate on the edge of the woods, the dark red walls on both sides crawling the vines, a thick, the feeling of time fluttering . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The male and female students wearing wide college robes are in twos and threes, or holding books, or carrying a bag and walking down the gate to the school to start a new day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole looks calm and peaceful, and the ancient school gas field at the end of the century is full of vividness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Griffin wearing a white dress stood with his two men standing in front of the door and looked into it with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The outsiders need to register inside." The strong people at the door said in a rough voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Griffin looked at the front without speaking, and the next side took out the documents: "This is the deputy bishop of the Holy Blood Church, some things need to be expensive. The principal of the school communicated in person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The deputy bishop!?" Seeing the document, the guard’s expression suddenly jumped and his face trembled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is his first close contact with such a big man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What to see? Not to report?" The clergyman reminded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This guard woke up like a dream, hurriedly nodded and ran into the room to call the short-distance area phone used on campus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After about thirty seconds, a middle-aged man who appeared to be the head of the guard was inside, and he smiled and nodded and said: "The deputy bishop! Principal Waiting for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Griffin nodded slightly and followed the middle-aged man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After ten minutes, in the quaint principal's room, a body is overweight, wearing a blue shirt, black bib, some bald middle-aged, round face He was filled with a smile and said: "Bishop Hodi, you are here today to be a believer. It is a privilege of believers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Blood Church in the Belle Empire The status is extraordinary. Although the administrative power of the general bishop level is similar to that of the mayor, in the social status, the status and authority of the bishop is much higher than that of the mayor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, he has blood therapy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The status of the bishop is sublime, and the status of the bishop is second only to the bishop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grifin sip a fragrant black tea: "Spring spring black tea in the Bichun Islands, the market price is 200 gram 500 grams, President Luther is really Good taste."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal, Luther, listened slightly to the corner of his eye and complimented: "The deputy bishop is really a master of tea ceremony, and a simple bite can be tasted. "Great! Great!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Griffin smiled and shook the cup in his hand and said carelessly: "With the monthly salary of President Luther, this black tea is almost yours. Month’s salary? President Luther is really willing to spend money.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luther’s forehead slowly oozes sweat, and some laughed: “Just This hobby, no way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This place Griffin put down the teacup, tilted the legs, and leaned back on the soft sofa and asked: "Expensive I remember a student named Evan Daniel, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &n Bsp; Luther heard this heart suddenly jumped, then frowned, and pretending to answer: "I don't really understand this, there are many students in the school, I don't remember every student."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That Mike Road, should you be familiar with this name?" Griffin asked with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Luther was completely panicked, but his face was still calm, and he nodded and said with a smile: "I know that Mike Lu is the best student in recent years. His improved steam engine is included in the steam union. In the "Steam Invention Handbook", it is the genius who is about to enter the steam union."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Griffin listened faintly and said: "Oh? You said How are these completely different from what I have heard?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luther listened to his heart and said: "This damn untouchable! Actually dare to go to church to complain? Waiting for this time, see how I killed you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was groaning, and Luther said with a smile on his face: "The words of the untouchables themselves cannot He believes that he is a student who wants to steal the scientific research results of his classmates and even beat his mentor. If you say this barbarians, don't believe it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Griffin heard this face completely gloomy, and asked: "Lousse, who told you who told me this to the people and the wild Human? Stupid guy, your ignorance and self-righteousness should have some boundaries!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Learning this, Lutherton was frightened and pale, his body trembled "Ah? Isn't it... isn't Evan Daniel telling you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tell me what is the most outstanding of our Church of the Holy Blood in recent years." The legendary bishop, Bishop Soge Sotos!" Griffin whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pump! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard this, Lutherton shook his body and his butt slipped to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Six months ago, Su Ge became a bishop, and the glorious century spread throughout the city of Bain, when the entire college even smashed a grand event in the name of Su Ge The celebration to show that this is the alma mater of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For more than half a year, Su Ge’s name has become the core of the school’s enrollment and has a selling point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Luther suddenly thought of some rumors that he had heard occasionally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The students said that the relationship between Evan and Su Ge seems to be very good. At that time, he thought that Evan was taking the opportunity to put gold on his face and did not pay attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now.........<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Griffin looked at him in a condescending manner, the tone of indifference: "I will not say that you insult the bishop of the Holy Blood, I I ask you, have you just said that you don’t know Evan Daniel?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, Luther’s pale face was a little blue, his lips trembled. Can't speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Griffin here watched him for a few seconds, and suddenly the expression of indifference turned into a soft smile, and came over to lift him up and smile. "President Luther, don't have any psychological burden. Our Bishop Sotos is a devout believer of the goddess. He will not fall into any innocent person. If you are forced to do this, say it, holy blood. The church will help you to be the master."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luther looked at Griffin’s smile like a yang, but he felt more and more like this smile than the gloomy expression. More horrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a person in the circle, he is deeply aware of the bloody means in the darkness of the Church of the Holy Blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially in the incident three years ago, the entire city was filled with blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Deputy Bishop...I...I..." Luther opened his mouth and couldn't speak for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Griffin brows slightly wrinkled: "Principal Luther, you can't help you like this! Don't say anything, just humiliate the bishop. Something can make you live the second half of the dungeon in the Church of the Holy Blood."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No! Don't! Don't!" Luther's panic Tao, it seems to have heard the most terrible thing in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Griffin patted him on the shoulder: "If you don't want to, please give me a good deal with this matter. The bishop is a very tolerant, very A kind person. Before I came, he also taught me that we should be kind to the goddess of the people, not to make this thing too big, he does not want this to affect the city of Bain, the development of his hometown, understand?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understand! Understand! I understand!" Luther heard this feeling and finally caught a glimpse of hope in the hell, immediately like a chicken Nodded like a rice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
