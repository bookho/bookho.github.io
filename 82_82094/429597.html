			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Su Ge came back from the medical district, he happened to meet the Bishop of Nell who was preparing for the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are doing pretty well, Bishop Sotos." Nell said faintly, with a high tone in his tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hege knows a series of recent actions, but he doesn't mind. Because in his view, Su Ge, who is acting like this, is his own, and this low-level bishop has to deal with these low-level things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an elite and a genius, you should focus on a more ambitious career, such as hosting a grand prayer meeting for the March goddess, that A scale that everyone in the city must participate in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the true believer, this is the real great cause!" Think about it, Nell feels excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge smiled and left without speaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not put Nell in his eyes, and now he is so close here, mainly to take over the foundation of the entire Bain city for himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I came back at night, I saw Lobo squatting on the ground, and the rag automatically curled up and became a kennel suitable for it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there any change in it recently? Lobo." Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lobo shook his head very humanly, then he ran over to Sug. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Some busy these days, take you out tomorrow!" Sug squatted down and touched his head and said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗷呜! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard that I could go out, I was excited and called. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After taking a shower, Sug comfortably lie in bed and fall asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he opened his eyes, he had already returned to the body of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After so much experience, the psionics soared, and Su Ge’s thoughts on the gods did not resist and fear as they did at the beginning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting up from the throne, Sug took the rifle and walked down the throne, stepping out of the temple and coming outside the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, all the souls of the entire Kingdom of God have sensed this powerful existence. The knight, the warrior, the ordinary soul are kneeling on the ground at the same time, and the expression is full of awe. And piety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No problem." Su Ge said a faint word, strolling on the land of the Kingdom of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul around the first heard the grateful dagger, then stood up and freely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a trick, Lobo’s huge body appeared alongside Su Ge with a ghost and a raging wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning over and sitting up, Su Ge looked at the sky and murmured: "Someone seems to be calling me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"The endless fog of the Lord, the dark enveloped, the bright devourer, the marginal great behemoth, the sly sheltered Lord God, listening to your servant's call..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prayers in the ear gradually became clear, and Su Ge immediately felt that one of the dim light spots had suddenly flashed and connected with himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the rest of the summoning methods activated?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug is very calm at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Su Ge is getting stronger now, and this spell is not as strong as before, Su Ge can even ignore it completely, or refuse it directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Humble bugs don't want to go through their own efforts, but are eager to get someone else's shelter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"But today's mood seems to be good, let a part of my body's body look past!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, a gray mist from Su Ge The body rises up and instantly disappears over the Kingdom of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge’s consciousness followed the fog and left the area. After a twist, he felt that he had come to a relatively cold and dark space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Awareness sweeps around, and Su Ge finds it seems to be the basement of a mansion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The area is very large, it looks like sixty or seventy square meters, the old books on the side are old classic books, there are many mysterious instruments on the side. And materials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of him is a woman who has a white robe and kneels on the floor and trembles all over her body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes swept away, and Suger found this to be a mystery and expert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a blink of an eye, I look at my current form, not as arrogant as the last time, when he becomes a large group of gray fog filled in the entire basement. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge does not intend to form a body, so 360 degrees without a dead end, look at everything here, do not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the ground, Jenny Solo trembled on the floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This trembling has fear and struggle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because she is a believer in the devout March goddess and is a deputy bishop who cures the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the original devout faith collapsed because of a series of recent events, and fell into a huge self-question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last night, she found out the spells in her family that have been used by no one for hundreds of years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the record, this mantra originated from ancient times and is the god of the clan that has completely disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And their family is one of the few descendants of that race. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the father died near her, she told her that if her faith is lost and she is caught in self-questioning, then using this spell, the great misty Lord will give her a new Vision and answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, after a day of preparation, she completed the call. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a veteran mystery, Jenny is very sure at this time that he does summon a god, or a part of the god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because she felt the horrible oppression and tremor in the fog of this room, this feeling made her dare not get up, even dare not look up, For fear of offending this great god, he can only wait for the Lord's approval in prayer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge looked around and found a lot of books he had never seen before, and confirmed that it is one of the three empires of the Bayaro Empire, which is the cure The location of the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This robes should be the clerics who heal the church. The position from Phnom Penh is at least the level of deputy bishop. A little bit, two of the three churches Aberdeen is really quite a lot."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my heart, Su Ge’s consciousness came to her, in front of her, there were three emeralds in front of her. , representing three options for communication. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Humans and gods have no way to communicate directly, so there are three emeralds on the summoning array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three gems represent the three states of the gods, the satisfaction, the dissatisfaction and the death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge’s heart is moving, using his own consciousness to light up the gem sitting on the left, indicating his satisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jenny on the ground, after seeing the jewel on the left, she was relieved with a deep breath, her hands on the ground, and said: "Thank you for your kindness, the great Lord of the Mist."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Lord of the Mist?" Su Ge found that his title had changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am similar to my imagination. The gods are multi-faceted. Each power represents a kind of divinity. It will be left behind according to the difference. Different images and different summoning spells. She remembers the power and spell of my foggy master."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jenny’s tone is very respectful Say: "Thank you for your kindness in responding to the ignorant, Jenny Solo's call, getting your response is the greatest honor and glory of the servant in this life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The stone on the left continues to flash, and Jenny knows that her courtesy and compliments have won the princess's patience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then she continued: "The great Lord of the Mist, the source of knowledge, the creator of the servant. The servant is willing to dedicate everything to the servant, the flesh, the soul, the property. Everything, I hope that you can lower your compassion and tell the ignorant and humble servant how to continue living and how to continue to uphold your beliefs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg still has no Speaking, now he has mastered the gas field and posture that a god should have. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Foolish guy, this low-level situation must also be shot by me? The Pope will be handed over to me." Su Ge thought, suddenly Launched his own power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, the entire fog began to shrink rapidly, and Jenny was included directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jenny feels that the indescribable terrorist power includes her own Linghu, and she feels a moment in the next second when she has not responded. Oh, I entered the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she returned to God, she found herself lying on a dark mud, surrounded by a lot of ice tombstones flashing blue light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faint mist is surrounded by the whole world. There are countless ghosts in the fog, and the huge wolf is slowly groaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thick bell rang, letting Jenny return from the shock, she looked up to the place where the bell came, and saw a majestic, sacred , solemn temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is... this is..." Jenny's inner beating speed increased, and a possibility grew wildly in her mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The neat footsteps sounded, and Jenny returned from her illusion, seeing a team of knights armed with horror, holding a neat pace Come here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a terrible temper, she can't estimate. But she knew that the knight's momentum was even more frightening than her pope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
