			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of Marx and Bobby's two attacks seems to be very large, and the repulsed carrion did not infiltrate from the ground again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that it has not been formed for a long time, there is no wisdom, and most of the actions are still instinct." Marx analyzed this situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge squatted at the corner of the wall and looked at the spell of Rogan's painting. After a while, I felt a dizzy feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t understand, but the problem of brain volume sequelae. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Supporting the forehead to stand up, Su Ge has some helplessness. He can only temporarily put down and turn around and ask: "Oh! Right, how should this event be rated?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the rules of the church, each mysterious event will have a different rating. Ratings range from Level 1 events to Level 10 events. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The different levels of events determine what level of clergy should be handled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bobby touched his chin and said, "This thing is very weak, I guess it is two levels, and it’s the top."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marx followed and nodded: "Well, it's level two."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Weak!?" Su Ge has some bitterness in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Rogan walked over and said, "Don’t rush to make a decision. Go ahead and see."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Rogan has completed the layout of the spell. There are seven on the ground, six on each of the four walls, and five on the roof. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this a sequential method?" Su Ge asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogen has some surprises: "Do you actually know the order method?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"嘿嘿, unintentionally Seen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sequential method refers to the method of constructing the matrix. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although each of the arrays looks disorganized, there are still rules to be found. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any squad needs to obey the process from scratch. Therefore, it is necessary to conform to certain known rules when constructing symbols, so that it can be easier to understand and easier to control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sequential method is to arrange the array according to the order of the numbers from small to large or from large to small. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogan’s eyes flashed a glimmer of light, not much to say: “Go, go see the owner here.”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he finished lighting the lantern in his hand, the first one went forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four people walk side by side through the corridor that passed through Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the corridor is completely different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After four people entered the corridor, accompanied by a very strange wind blowing, there were a dozen scary, bloodshot eyes on the wall. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These eyeballs stare at four people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Small!" Bobby said easily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it’s a trifle, but Suguen felt that the surroundings began to be illusory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpected Su Ge did not rely on three patrols, but hurriedly bowed his head and began to meditate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, take out the silver ash from the waist and suddenly scatter to yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly Unreal Stop. When Su Ge raised his head, he saw that the three night-watchers had already cleared their eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good vigilance." Rogan nodded with satisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four people in the talking room walked through the corridor to the steps leading to the basement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the step was dark, and on the wall, the ground was full of countless worms with tentacles and fangs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I rub!" Sugerton burst into sweat, and he had a goose bump and a tingling scalp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge, who had a certain fear of bugs, felt uncomfortable at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These worms felt a harsh sound when they felt four people, and opened their mouths to the four people, like a black tide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogan slightly raised his lantern: "My Lord is the goddess of the night, my Lord is the source of the moonlight, my Lord is the incarnation of black and dark ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the prayers of Rogan’s prayers, you can see the darkness of the surrounding, with the moonlight projected from the window quickly condensing into the flames. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The tide of the dark moon, rising!" Finally, a low drink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame in the lantern suddenly soared, and suddenly slammed out from the lantern into a very strange purple flame wall pushed forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;噗嗤! Hey! Hey! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The worm that touched the flame wall burst instantly, and the black smell disappeared into a small piece of carrion with a stench. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug hurriedly pulled up the collar of his inner underwear to form a black mask on his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the unique design of church clothing. The clergy have a variety of tasks at all times, and the investigation and tracing is on the one hand, and when necessary, it is necessary to fight and even burn the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, during the evolution of the uniform, the collar of the underwear is intentionally enlarged, and a simple mask can be formed when necessary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The material of the collar is specially treated. After the cover, Su Ge has not smelled the disgusting taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, the tide of the flame has been pushed to the end of the stairs, and all the worms are burned out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three men also brought masks and stepped on the carrion on the steps to move on. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time as the advancement, the three people of Rogan also painted the same spell with silver ash on the surrounding walls, completely cutting off the mysterious connection here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Step by step, very stable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug took out the key to open the door, and the wall inside was covered with a grayish-black substance that was as disgusting as the moss, with strange mushrooms growing on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This mushroom is pale in color, has a quirky texture, does not look like a mushroom, but is like a piece of flesh that has been cut down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other two doors are still the same as before, but the mortuary door has been broken by tremendous power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large number of disgusting carrion piled up together, surrounded by countless disgusting bugs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle, the whole body of the white and soft baby squatted on it, full of vicious and invisible eyes staring at four people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow wow! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horrible corpse opened his mouth and made a harsh scream, and then the carrion behind him swelled, forming numerous innumerable tentacles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug saw a short sword directly pulled out of his waist, while gently sliding over his wrist, cutting silver blood smeared on the blade . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brushing brush! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge flexibly wields a short sword and instantly cuts off several tentacles close to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogan has a lot of calmness here, and the lantern is raised again. The flame elf rises up and wraps around the four people, destroying all the approaching tentacles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The evil spirits have not yet been fully formed and dealt with in a secondary event." Rogan said, taking a step forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marx and Bobby heard nod and nodded, holding their irons in their hands and bowing their heads. In the next second, the bodies of the two men were integrated into the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This skill is so handsome!" Su Ge jumped in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Rogan’s lanterns are shaken, the tide of the flames appears again, this time it becomes even bigger, and the entire space is covered quickly to approach the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow wow! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this corpse baby made a very harsh sound, the carrion behind him began to violently squirm and swell, as if something came out from inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I still want to continue corpse? Dreaming." Rogan snorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;噗嗤! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a second, the carrion that had piled up the entire room squirmed, and suddenly there was a strange eye with three heads in the middle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My God! What is this?" Su Ge took a heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This eye swayed and then crawled out of the carrion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, two thorny iron rods appeared from the darkness, squatting on the body of the corpse from both directions, sandwiching it intermediate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The murder of the corpse is louder, and the eyeball behind it is also in the violent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Purification!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two big drinks, the thorns and iron rods flashed after a little rubbing A glaring thunder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, the body of the corpse baby suddenly blew open like a ball that was over-filled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
