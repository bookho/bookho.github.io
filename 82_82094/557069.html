Xue Lier asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ancient thing, "She" was personally experienced, she never remembered such a eternal family of Titan stars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug saw her serious look, and her heart moved, showing a look of remembrance: "God can't call his name, I only Can tell you his title."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Say." Shirley seems to be very concerned about this matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He called the tyrant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Herba!!" Shirley dark The frowning wrinkles are even more powerful, so that her beautiful tall nose has some slight folds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What characteristics does he have?" Shelly asked, she didn't have any impression of the name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge extended his right hand and said: "He also has a glove with six gems embedded in it, just like the Holy Grail now. His power is at its peak. At that time, only one finger is needed to erase half of the life of the whole world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge made a snap: "Like this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley fell into Deep meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge naturally knows that it is easy to reveal the danger of filling, so he said: "Look at them before they come, hurry and leave here."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he finished, he pulled away from Shirley’s hand and quickly left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl was a little uncomfortable with him, and he said, "Don’t treat me as a little girl."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge whispered: "You are not a little girl, then you have gone to destroy them!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley listens After squinting, his face said with a sinister voice: "If you dare to say, do you believe that I am looking for an opportunity to marry you!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugton squatted and smiled: "Just kidding."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This woman said that he can do it, and he is very good at it. decisive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the two contact time is not long, Su Ge feels very accurate about her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others needless to say, just because she and gauze fuse this thing, Su Ge knows that this woman is absolutely a sinister . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shelly followed Suge and said, "Don’t think that after I have a physical relationship with me, I will treat you like a mortal woman." "Yi Yi Bai Shun."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge spread his hand: "I don't dare to expect this, you are not happy, I am very happy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shelly looked at Su Ge’s side and continued: “You are not allowed to interfere with any of my decisions and actions, and, if necessary, according to the agreement, I want With the Holy Grail, you can't resist."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge heard that there was no blind promise, turned to look at her, and said sharply: "I With my own principles and my own insistence, if you do something beyond my bottom line and can't recover, I will kill you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shirley opened her mouth and had a sinister sin on her face. She said, "Let's see if you have this ability."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She seems to be the slightest Scottish care say such cruel words of the story. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is silent and moves on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After about ten minutes, Su Ge suddenly found out that without Gerlos leading the way, lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you remember the way to come?" Su Ge asked Sherry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shelly snorted: "I still need to come in like a mortal like you? I am all coming in from the sky." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Say so much use, don't you still know." Su Ge sighed and moved on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley touched the silver teeth and raised her fist to the back of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was shunned by the prophet of Su Geweib: "This punch is so bad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Your night clock!?" Shelley looked down at her beautiful and delicate fist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fist is now no different from the mortal, becoming weak and weak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, the joy of being in the world is not so obvious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge scratched his head: "This place is too big and the road is too complicated. My effective distance is only 60 meters. When I release it, I can see the passage." But I can't see the head and I can't see the tail. I don't know where I am going."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl did not continue to speak, quietly followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now she is very weak, it is best not to say too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, when Su Ge was about to be forced, he contacted Randall and Jellos through hunting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three people who were flying at this time have joined together, but they are outside the tunnel at this time, not inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge heard that he immediately used his identity as a clockman and ordered Randall to come and greet himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Randall is very happy, and it’s coming over as a black fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug turned to look at Shirley: "Do you need to deal with this face?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley listened slightly and nodded, and waved black, the black breath grew on the robe, and a huge hood covered her face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This ability is really convenient." Su Ge is somewhat envious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl said calmly: "When you reach the Great Sage, you can."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge’s face was awkward, and he was shocked and asked: “Are you a big sage before?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl said freely: “Don’t take human knowledge to measure I."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are already human now." Su Ge stressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley silences: "I should have been a dominator before."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then How do you have the means of a great sage?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only low-level humans will go up the ladder level like a ladder. Really advanced creatures have many abilities. Just born," said Shirley faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge thought about it suddenly, she is the son of the great god of power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Newton...powerful god, is this coincidence?" Su Ge muttered in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Five minutes later, Randall found Su Ge, and when he saw Su Ge, he looked a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong?" Su Ge noticed his expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Randall said a lot: "Suddenly you feel more mature and more stable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Why can you see?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The temperament, it is like the things that have been suppressed for many years have been released, become confident, the whole person's spirit God is different.” Randall touched his chin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge heard this and immediately thought of the two hours of sense of accomplishment and conquest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recalling his virgin experience for nearly two decades, there are indeed many things that have been released. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, always grow." Su Ge walked forward with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Randall didn't ask much, just turned and suddenly noticed Shirley behind Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is..." Randall had some doubts. From the figure, he always felt that this person had seen it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge casually said: "She is called..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug just getting ready to introduce, snow Lil said: "Let's go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She doesn't seem to let others know her name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Randall heard the voice, quietly asked through the seal: "Adult, this is... Ada Newton!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge sighs his insight and says, "No."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Randall though Very confused, but did not ask much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five fifteen minutes later, three people came out of a hole and stood at the root of the entire mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking up and seeing that the eggs of the entire black goat have been dispersed, together with the gloomy atmosphere of the entire ancient city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the end of the change, the disappearance of the Holy Grail, the ancient city of Aya looks like an ancient city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just coming out, Gerlos said: "The situation is not very good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge Looked and found that there was a lot of church troops suddenly appearing in the distance, and it seemed that there were at least 2,000 people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two thousand people have formed a huge battle that will surround the entire palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the more than two thousand people, the mysterious master of the Master of Light is nearly twenty, and of course, the three archbishops of Laurie, and the Holy Father. And the two lords of Ryan’s peak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey! It’s really big." Seeing this battle, Su Ge was not scared, just some accidents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerlos whispered: "There are three masters who came out of the maid of the Holy Grail, the caged, the aurora, the gravekeeper. These three are perennial Perseverance in the grail of the Holy Grail, known as the taboo bishop. These people's abilities are very different. Be careful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley listened with a sneer: "The caged person and the Aurora have brought it. It seems that I really intend to kill me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrew Dajian said casually: "It is really a measure of the good use of the church in March."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he finished, he turned to look at Su Ge: "What are your plans? This battle is not able to rush out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg seems to be ready, right color said: "Andrew, your mission is over, there is no need and We stirred up together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andr smiled: "I have long been accustomed to the March church's style of work. Today, I have the opportunity to naturally be angry. Anyway, they didn't dare to treat me. Kill me and smack the curse of the abyss in my body. It is estimated that they can turn them around and scare and run."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;When I heard this crazy, Su Ge smiled helplessly: "Well, you can just make trouble, don't worry about me. They don't have any way to take me."<br /><br />&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's simple."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When several people talk, not far from the opposite, the Holy Father carries three archbishops Come over and say to Su Ge: "Sug, the lost girl of the goddess, please listen to me at the end and give up resistance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge Forward A few steps, took off the mask and said with a smile: "Thank you for the kindness of the Holy Father, but to be honest, the church in March does not suit me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take Shirley Handed it out!" At this time, Laurie loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge spread his hand: "Sorry, as a gentleman, I have to say it. I have said that I am responsible for Ms. Shelley, so naturally I am responsible." In the end."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, whether it was Randall and others, or the people across from the church, even the other forces behind the church were watching the lively The four colleges are a bit weird at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because this is a very misunderstanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl is still calm at this time, standing next to Su Ge, whispering: "Be careful of the cage, the helmet is like a barrel-like guy. The knowledge of this group of people is solidified and very difficult."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
