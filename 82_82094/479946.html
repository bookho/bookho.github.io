			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hotel, Laurie’s mouth showed a smile: “Guinness, a little bit interesting.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the tracking of Su Ge, he has seen the three tall werewolf residents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How did Vanas reinvent these werewolves into ordinary people and let them master this transformational ability?" Laurie's I was a little curious in my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it the ability of the great god of death?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the apartment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three werewolves turned to clean up the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge looked down at the young man and asked: "Are you a cold-hearted church or a research institute?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man’s heart jumped and said honestly: “The Institute of Polar Studies.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“What about you?” Su Ge Turn around and ask the fighters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fighters also hurriedly asked: "I am also a researcher at the Institute of Polar Studies."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "Well," Su Ge nodded, facing Hills. "Kill him!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instant, dark dragon scales covered Hills The whole body, like a razor-like sharp claw, grabbed the neck of the fighter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't kill me! Don't kill me! I... I am a cold-hearted church, we are all cold-hearted church people!" This timid guy Suddenly screamed and told the truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Witch of the Dragon!?" Laurie saw that the shape of Hills was a little unexpected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the case, no wonder the dragon witch and the steel witch suddenly disappeared. It was hidden by him. Who would have thought of a newcomer who just joined the church?" Will there be guts to hide the witch? Sogo Sotos, I admire your courage and courage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, Su Ge looked down at the strong young man and said, "You have a last chance. If you dare to lie, I won't kill you. But you should have heard that there is a special study in the palace of Guinness. The potion of the potion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stalwart youth suddenly paled, the potion master he certainly knows, even before the organization of people to go with him Have had contact, but failed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s mouth showed a cold smile: “Fortunately, with the permission of Her Majesty the Queen, my relationship with him is still very good, he recently Need a living body, preferably a mystery."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man heard the forehead suddenly oozing a layer of cold sweat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He believes that Su Ge’s words, Su Ge is the bishop here, and that the demon hunter is a court attendant, and it is quite normal to have a good relationship with Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the crucial moment, his teeth moved and he was ready to take his own poison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Hills’s keen sense immediately found his little movements, and the fast hand was like a shadowless hand, pinching his chin in an instant. , pull down and directly pull his chin off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then violently penetrated his sharp claws into his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; slamming, smashing the poisoned teeth, said coldly: "Alchemist, you are very dangerous, if there is such a If you have symptoms, I will smash down your teeth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh His face was pale and he nodded and couldn’t speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge ignored him and turned to the fighter: "What is your purpose?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Headquarters... Let us arrest you and ask the whereabouts of Bishop Clawson." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugarton was at a glance and asked: "Do you have any other help, or is it a partner?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, just a few of us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have any fellow practitioners? I know that it is more than just your family." Su Ge said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fighting house trembled and said: "We...had had a brief contact with the thieves’ guild and the people of the Institute of Polar Studies. They seem to be ready to do it for you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are there other things?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I only know so much." The fighters honestly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge nodded with satisfaction and turned to indicate that Hills had picked up the chin of the young man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you know anything else that is valuable?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stalwart youth said stiffly: "I don't know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then you are useless Su Ge said coldly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the three werewolves came back with a hint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge pointed to the sturdy youth: "He was sent to the palace to hand over to Master Mill, the fighter who left his life and sent it to the church."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes! Bishop!" The three men nodded at the same time and expressed their understanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg then disappeared into the night with Hills. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next time, Su Gewan, like the autumn wind sweeping the leaves, constantly found some hidden places of mysterious people, and directly executed in the face of fierce resistance. Such as the Institute of Polar Studies, encountered relatively peaceful and neutral, sent to the church, handed over to Griffin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At one o'clock in the morning, Su Ge took care of the thirteen mysteries and returned to the church to rest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Laurie, who has been monitoring all the way, has an accurate judgment on the situation of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1: It is true that there is a secret profession, which is related to sound vibration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2: Collusion with the witch is a veritable heresy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3: Although the werewolves in the city seem to be like his followers, they are more instructed by Vanas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4: Vanas said yes, some of the believers that Suger thinks are actually under the control of Vanas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The core goal of this time is two people, Su Ge and the Witch of the Dragon. Others will not deal with it for the time being." Laurie set a preliminary plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge, who secretly returned to the church, did not alarm anyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, the sun was shining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bench of the wide front yard of the Cathedral of the Holy Blood, Su Ge leaned there, with three thick books beside him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warm sun shines down, warm and comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today Su Ge wants to see the basic spells of the mysterious world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I came back the day before yesterday, I was attacked by the bondage. This is not the first time that Soge has been hindered by this thing, just the next time he is very Ample, I plan to study the mysterious circle in detail, and as a starting point, it is naturally a basic spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contents of the book:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called basic spell does not require any occupation, as long as you study hard , with enough psionic power to release the spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are not many basic spells, but they are spells that every mystery needs to master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Learn first to test the psionic strength of the mysterious person when you get started, which is more conducive to choosing the right career. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, basic spells can also bring great convenience to mystery in daily life and battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basic spells include: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bounding: Binding certain objects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strengthen: Enhance the attributes of a material. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jumping: It can make people jump farther. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eagle Eye: It can be seen farther. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meditation: Helping people refine their psionic powers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hypnosis: Help people to sleep quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imitation: Imitating the shape of an object. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Automatic: Let some objects move themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noise: Produces a lot of noise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Refrigeration: Cooling down certain objects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mars: Produce Mars for easy ignition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simplified: Increase the density of certain substances. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are these things? Binding, intensive surgery can also What is the significance of this noise and imitation?" Su Ge looked at the twenty or thirty basic spells with a weird look, and spit it down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The initial effect of these spells is not to fight, but to make the mystery more convenient in the process of learning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, the bondage, the first opportunity to appear is that a female mysterious person is too lazy to comb, so invented the most primitive bondage. You don't have to comb your hair every day, you can bundle your hair with psionic energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this, Su Ge is amazed: "My God, how lazy this lady is!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also intensive techniques, through the correction of psionic energy, according to a special structure can enhance the material of certain materials. The opportunity for this spell to appear is that a mysterious person often needs to write words. There is no pen at the time, and it is generally a quill. It will take a long time to break. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mystery then increased the intensity of the quill by three times through the input of psionic power, which is the source of intensive surgery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, noise is because a mysterious person retaliated against a couple who were always arguing next door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, Mars is because a mysterious person often forgets to carry a match when camping, so he invented it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Su Ge suddenly discovered that he really overestimated the so-called sages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basic spells are called basic spells, but they are not basic. There is no knocking and shortcut to learning the basic spells, only through constant practice and exploration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basic spells are not meant to be weak. These spells have a very good growth, and as people gain psionic power, the power of these spells increases. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the records, there was once a mysterious person at the lord level who used a noise technique to directly kill four people, 12 people with eardrum rupture, 37 people Sudden deafness, intermittent tinnitus in hundreds of people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, there are a lot of straightforward key points in the basic spells, and there are very diverse development routes and auxiliary effects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, an archer can learn eagle eye, a fighter can learn jumping, an illusionist can learn hypnotism, etc., so don't underestimate basic spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In how many times of life and death battles, it is often this seemingly insignificant basic spell that determines the outcome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this, Su Ge looked up at the sky: "It makes a lot of sense, although it’s late, but it’s not too late.” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The initial introduction of Su Ge was brought in by Jelos even flicking, and then he relied entirely on himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
