			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Wolf Blood Corps Su Ge heard that their nature is similar to that of the Fortress, but they are not as wide as the fortress, they only Handling things related to the abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many things in the abyss, as Gwens said, one is more ugly than the one, and it will definitely scare people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So someone must be in charge of the abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first person in the rumor who cares about the abyss is also an undead person. No one knows his name. He has two titles because of the times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A long time ago, he was known as the abyss boiling, and today, is known as the gaze of the abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks to them for many years, the abyss of the abyss rarely came to the world, and most of them just ran out of the abyss and were killed by the Legion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above is the general intelligence of the mystery, and Su Ge is the master, and also knows some deep things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Wolf Legion holds a special stigma: Covenant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sacred mark is an ancient relic, swearing by wolf blood, forming a relationship with each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are all elites, and all the Legionnaires bear the covenant marks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the so-called wolf blood, is the wolf god symbolizing unity and courage in ancient times, the blood of Wolf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third: the abyss is alive, the Wolf Blood Legion has been entangled with it, unable to get out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Randall said: "The Wolf Blood Legion has a detached status and monitors the entire night scene through various means. Of course, they only deal with the abyss, others No matter what."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge touched his chin: "The two groups seem to be stronger than your family."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Randall is a bit embarrassed, as the truth goes: "You are right, but they rarely ask the world, the overall secular aspect, naturally my family is the only one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge nodded slightly: "Be careful, continue."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The fourth is that you are very familiar with the cold church, they have been there for many years, and We count as well water and do not commit river water. They are mainly interested in corpses, and they are used to following the bodies behind us. The strength coverage is also very wide."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The fifth The Glorious Church. The cold-hearted church and the shining church have been the enemy of generations. For many years, the two sides have been fighting the most. They should each pinch about 20% of the resources of the night. Our family accounts for 40%, and the remaining 20% ​​are Other forces have been divided, including the Assassin League, the Green Flame Brotherhood, and the Sorcerer Sisters."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The whole night is equivalent to a freedom In the extrajudicial world of trading, where the provisions of the March church are completely useless, killing people can be more Is the order of the day. "Sears added. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly: "I remember the middle of the night and the storm plateau, is the misty mountain?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, there are fogs all year round, the mountains are steep, and few people live."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there a country in that place?" Su Ge suddenly asked . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Randall smiled and said: "How can there be a country in that place!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge Shen said for a moment: "You clean up and immediately leave for Guinness and Jean. He needs your help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jean is not at you Are you around?” Randall stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He just went back, I let him go back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately, Randall’s heart will Immediately nodded: "Good!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, After breakfast, Su Ge was just about to go out and saw Griffin's look a little embarrassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He first bowed and then said: "Now two small countries have temporarily lost contact with the outside world. One is the Kingdom of Rongka and the other is the Kingdom of Rosia. These two places are located on the wheat-colored mountains north of the Misty Mountains. A small mountain country, sandwiched between the night land and the storm plateau,"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly: "It’s hard, but the last step is to send people and The two countries contacted at the fastest speed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Griffin nodded hard: "Well, is there anything else?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge swayed at him and whispered a few words in his ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, Griffin's eyes widened, indicating incredible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go!" Su Ge waved his hand and left the room alone, leaving only some overwhelmed Griffin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Blood Library. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fr. Water is still in a wheelchair, some clumsy to organize books on the shelves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blowing the dust on a book, Father Water suddenly said: "The bishop is not knowing what to do, want to read the book?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, but I am afraid there is no answer in this library, so I would like to ask you directly." Su Ge stood behind him, smiling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French Waters put the book down and replied with incompetence: "I am old and weak, my old eyes are dim, I am afraid I can't give the answer that the bishop wants."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge walked over and said seriously: "I just want to ask one thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Walter's pale and sparse eyebrows shook and looked at Su Ge: "I have experienced very much in my life, but it is so few that I remember. You are afraid of being disappointed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled: "Some things are not worth remembering themselves. The human brain is so big. Remembering things that are meaningless is itself a waste."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walter turned to the wheelchair and looked around. He carefully looked at Sug and smiled: "It's not a good thing to be too curious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger replied: "If humans Losing curiosity, the world will not progress."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walter slowly returned to his guarded counter: "Since the bishop can see this old thing, Then ask, if the old things I can't answer, I hope the bishop should not blame."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge sat down and asked seriously: "The church chased You are so far away, why didn't you get back to you at the end?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walt is turning the book and suddenly feels a stiff, and laughed: "The bishop is this What do you mean?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is silent: "Luke bears a holy mark, even if he is crazy, but according to his disposition, he is not from the maze. The guard who escaped from the middle. Three years ago, the whole city was full of bloody smells, and the blood released quickly evaporated, and the taste quickly disappeared. Only the blood that solidifies the blood clot can emit such a big pungent smell when it gradually melts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yesterday, when Su Ge and Ada chatted, occasionally When I mentioned Luke, I said a few words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This suddenly made Su Ge think of a problem that was forgotten by himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In yesterday’s thinking in the body, Su Ge analyzed all of his information by Luke, Bart, and Emilia, and got a possibility in his heart. So I found the old priest today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the information was insufficient, Su Ge always thought that Luke was the guard who ran out of the maze, but combined with the current situation and the knowledge of the bishop, Sugerton felt that it was wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Church of the Holy Blood is blood-respected and produces two special occupations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bleeding, and coagulation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two are all related to blood, but their origins are different. The blood coagulation was born in the maze of blood, mainly defensive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood-sucker was born in the Star Heaven, mainly to pursue killing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first, Su Ge thought that Father Water was a guardian of every city. However, after becoming a bishop, Su Ge found that only Bain City was a special case. There are no similar guardians in other places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emilia’s reminder made Sug’s focus on the speciality of the old priest who had not noticed before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The identity of Luke’s bloodletters has been determined, but the original Su Ge did not know the presence of coagulation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until yesterday, he and Nell’s battle, saw those weird blood-colored monsters, sorted through the body of the mind, everything on paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be inferred that the guard who took out the Labyrinth of the Holy Blood was not Luke, but Father Water. Luke was ordered to come and follow Father Water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then Luke is likely to go crazy because of Father Water, so he was not willing to see Father Water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not Luke, but Father Water, who slaughtered those mysterious people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French Water is silent, looking up at Su Ge, the turbid eyes with an indescribable cold, and in the middle of the day, Su Ge’s nose smells again. A pungent rust smell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Children, even if you know, you shouldn’t say it in person. Some things are not good to say." Father Water said calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, he is like a person. The old priest from the old and aging body suddenly became a bloodthirsty blade full of bloody smell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is still calm: "I know, I was going to keep doing this, but I changed my mind yesterday."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What state of mind?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was scared before, now I am not afraid."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you afraid of?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing is scared."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Death?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I won't die." Su Ge is calm and confident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fr. Water sneaked a hand, a dilapidated scythe full of khaki rust appeared in his hand, not knowing where this thing was from him Take it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rust is more intense, and Su Ge even feels that his blood is gradually solidifying and cannot flow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a thick bell rang from the body of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugeton feels a lot more comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this bell, Father Water had some surprises, and a strange smile appeared on the corner of his mouth: "What kind of thing is this?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Night clock."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When is the night clock?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"When the Holy Declaration."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A moment of silence, Father Water The hand was squatting again, and the huge sickle was folded left and right, and it turned into a cylinder with only 30 centimeters being taken into the sleeve by him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s an honor to think of me as a slashing knife, which can cause the attention of the gods." Father Water again changed back to the kindly old priest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge spit out a sigh of relief: "You have not answered my question yet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" What is the meaning?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In order to take your future, sooner or later One day I will know that there is no need to take risks,” Water said faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
