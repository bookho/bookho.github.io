			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Su Ge’s heart suddenly burst into a storm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He once thought about whether the world could be restarted after it was destroyed, because the world is too deformed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To hear this now, Sugton knew that his feelings were not wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world has indeed experienced the baptism of the last days, and then the second civilization that was re-established on the ruins for some reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The dream is shrouded...Unexpectedly, the one that caused the destruction of the world should be Cthulhu. Only Cthulhu has the whole world The power of your own dreams."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait, the record of Byron the Great is also a knowledge of dreams, known as the god of dreams. In the process, the Byron Dias people survived, this is definitely not an accident. From this point of view, the madness of Byron the Great is probably not because of the Holy Grail, but because of the exposure to Cthulhu in the dream. Even Later, the destruction of the whole world, the awakening of Cthulhu may have a relationship with Byron the Great, which is the core reason why the Byron Dias people can have such a long time and can continue to continue!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Su Ge seems to know more about the truth of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪嗒! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Su Ge’s vision increased again by two points and came to 41. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment of breaking through 40 points of vision, Su Ge felt that his spirit seemed to have undergone some changes, and there were even a lot of auditory hallucinations in his ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This auditory hallucination has a whisper of constant whispers, horrible embarrassment, and even a burst of mad laughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even, he heard a burst of blood flowing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The source of the sound is his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"40 points of vision is a hurdle. After this hurdle, you can know a lot of interesting things that make people feel happy." Black seems to have discovered the change of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is still calm, but the indifference in the eyes seems to be deeper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have seen 88 people who have seen it. When he first met, he didn't kill me. When I met for the second time, I killed him. Su Ge said very unpretentious words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bryce heard this somewhat unexpected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge converges on the mood and asks: "I am very curious, with your thinking and strength, it should be easy to escape and hide, why should I be brought here? Come? What is your purpose? You know very well that after coming here, you have almost no hope of going out again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bryce smiled: "I The body is not here, I don't care if I am caught. Secondly, there are some wonderful and amazing inventions that need to be recognized and paid attention by other people in the world. Otherwise, is this amazing great invention not in vain?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is your masterpiece, in the north?" Su Ge asked. & Nbsp;; & nbsp; & nbsp; <br <br /> & nbsp /> Bryce micro blind eye: "You know more than I imagined." <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; &nbsp; "And in the middle of the mountains, the clouds are haunting." Su Ge's self-confidence continued. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bryce smiled even more brilliantly: "This will be a great masterpiece that shocks the world, the beginning of a demonstration to the three moons, the prelude to a new era! Ge Sotos, get ready! The new world is coming. In this new era, I hope that you are a waver in the tide, not a shrimp that is broken by the tide."<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Scotland answered quietly:. "I'm not going to be who try their hand" <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Then, in the eyes Burning the ice blue ghosts and ghosts: "I am the king of all the frozen hunters."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good! Very good! That's it. That's how it looks. Go find the holy grail file, find the holy grail file, and combine my book, you can know your destination."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bryce said cheerfully, his body began to fester quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the blink of an eye, it becomes a pile of disgusting meat and bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because anger is venting out on Ner, Su Ge seems to have entered the sage form just finished, not much to Bryce Hatred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, anger and hatred are consumables. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the contemplation, Su Ge stood up, but at this moment, Su Ge once again felt an indescribable cold, approaching himself. The invisible greasy thing like a snake seems to be close again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evening bell rang, and Suge suddenly turned back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This moment, Su Ge, who has crossed the 40-point visual mark, saw what it was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This thing is like a huge meat mass, all red, with a lot of very disgusting tentacles on it, these tentacles are covered with long fangs Suction cup mouthpiece. At this point the mouth is not breaking, eager to eat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meatballs are like a bloated irregular meatball, just like the braised lion head that Suger had eaten before. He has no head, no face, no eyes, and is growing underneath. A terrible, full of white fangs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is relatively large in size, and those tentacles, each about three meters long, look like a huge octopus at first glance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time its other tentacles were caught on the roof, and the tentacle with the suction cupper just swam in the position where Su Ge sat down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Star of the Fine!" Seeing this monster Su Ge's eyes tightened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stars is one of the Yi people known to the church today and needs 41 points to see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are huge, physically strong, and have a very high mysterious tolerance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have the ability to infiltrate houses and fly, and the overall combat capability is not strong. Most of the cases are not monsters attacking humans, but as some kind of high-level existence, even some messengers of gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turns out!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the essence of this star, Su Ge’s mind suddenly thought, When I helped Evan solve the curse problem a few days ago, the blood was taken away by something intangible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In combination with the position of the messenger, Su Ge immediately thought that this star essence is a kind of high-level messenger. The prayer ceremony of the blood curse is based on the power of that one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge did not rashly attack the essence of this star. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The essence of the star is notoriously hard, because it is a star of the scorpion, it has its own form outside the field, conventional means can not kill. And it is still The ambassador of a certain god has a deity in the body, and a rash attack will only provoke the one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although I am a god, I am against others." There is no fear or fear in the gods, but now the gods can't be active in reality, and it is a big risk to sin a god."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The star of the messenger possesses the sanctuary of the god, which is why it is free to enter and exit the Cathedral of the Holy Blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of Su Gesi, the star of the star did not rush to attack Su Ge, it hangs on the roof at this time, with the mouth of the tentacle Constantly swinging, quiet makes people feel hairy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two sides were deadlocked for a while, and Su Ge suddenly thought of a possibility, so he raised his right hand and suddenly burned the cold flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seeing the cold flame, the essence of the star immediately became active, and the drooping tentacle stopped swinging and came over, reaching out to the tentacle, and the mouthpiece above it began to wriggle, then Carefully suck the cold flame into it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sure enough, it follows my goal is cold flame!" Su Ge thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the normal sense, this messenger does not need to eat, nor does it have too much active aggression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are pets that are tamed by the gods, and unless the gods give them a clear command, they will proactively approach humans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last repayment of the sacrifice was perfect, and Su Ge could feel the satisfaction of the sacrifice through the connection in the dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, from the last time until now, the reason this guy has been following himself is not the last disrespect and rudeness, but the sacrifice for the existence. It seems too popular. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Easy to send the messenger to Suge to ask for "snacks." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This idea can be very daring and disrespectful to normal people. After all, in the eyes of normal people, the gods are unspeakable and cannot be described by common sense. s things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Su Ge itself is a god, this idea is not absurd for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here, the body of the star that swallowed this large group of cold flames slowly disappeared through the roof of the church house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After feeling the essence of the star, Su Ge sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today he is not too sure to face the essence of the star, after all, it has the sanctuary of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a bit interesting, from the essence of this star, you can be sure that the so-called gods are not extinct, but for some reason, they are isolated, or Being trapped in a place can only be contacted by human beings through a medium such as a messenger or a dream, just like my god. Now the source of all sacrifices is to exchange power with the gods through offerings."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Su Ge once again thought of what Blythe had just said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A world that is extinct once, is that era extinct, so that the whole world is no longer suitable for the gods to survive, to create isolation?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking, Su Ge walked out of the ward, just outside the door and met with Father Harden, who ran to visit the disease, Ivan and others met face to face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
