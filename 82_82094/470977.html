			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Joel’s departure, the female warlock did not mean to relax. She knew very well that the Church of the Holy Blood and the Church of Glory itself were the best, and they saved themselves. Down, it is very likely that there is a more disgusting purpose hidden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug turned and looked down at the female warlock who was lying on the floor and asked, "What is your name?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female warlock snorted without speaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug didn’t care, facing Griffin: “Go to lunch, I’ll talk to her.”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Bishop." Griffin nodded and respectfully left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female warlock looked at Su Ge with a cold eye and said coldly: "I advise you not to move anything that doesn't make sense. I won't tell." Anything about you, if you want to invade me, I will make you regret for a lifetime."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge squinted and a smile on his lips: "I It's not that kind of boring person, and you're not the type I like."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear this, the female warlock is slightly looser, carefully looking at Su Gedao "The whole mysterious world says that you are the most illegitimate child in recent decades. Now it seems that it is just a rumor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Gehe smiled and reached out One point, the female warlock's bondage is untied: "You don't have to worry too much. I don't have any malice against the female warlock. You can be a transaction between us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female warlock is more vigilant, because this bishop is a bit too abnormal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let you make a living, I want to know about Edda Newton." Su Ge said bluntly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female warlock sneered in her heart and finally revealed the fox tail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You holy blood church really did not let go of any information related to the witch." The female warlock voice said ironically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge knows that one and a half will make her believe that she is somewhat difficult: "Don't want to say, don't leave, you will be Guinness with me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge turned to the carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female warlock seized the opportunity and turned to prepare to run. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you want to die, you can take a step forward." Su Ge’s voice came slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, the female warlock felt that her body was stiff, her neck turned slightly, and the crunchy nail-like eyes saw two huge wings covered with black feathers. Put it on your shoulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, the female warlock feels like she is staring at something terrible. As long as she changes a little, she will be super-excited to the indescribable existence. The cruel way she imagined killed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her body is as stiff as a stone sculpture, and she does not dare to move, even the eyeballs are afraid to turn, and the gasps are instinctively stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, maybe a moment, or maybe a few minutes, the female warlock feels dying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just when she was desperate, a voice came: "gasp."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cough and cough ......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female warlock’s face was pale and blue, and she fell to the ground with a weak body, accompanied by a violent cough and greed, breathing oxygen, almost giving herself I am drowning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wheezing for a while, the female warlock held her chest carefully and looked at Suge’s dark leather shoes and trousers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Eating." Su Ge said, turned and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes looked at Su Ge’s back carefully, and Yu Guang saw the carriage next to the carriage, and the fragrant barbecue and bread were ready. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What the hell is it!?" The female warlock was still unable to control the trembling at this moment, and the weak legs stumbled and stood up, approaching here. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, she did not dare to question and violate any order of this mysterious bishop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just... she didn’t want to experience that horror in her life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three temporary small dining tables, two for one groom, one for Su Ge, one for Griffin and one for the female warlock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hot barbecue tastes very good, the painful knife is cut into pieces and sandwiched in bread, very delicious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female warlock carefully eats and looks around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Found that both the bishop and the groom were imagining, and from the perspective of the two grooms, it seems that the bishop is completely different from her imagination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Griffin looked at the female warlock and said casually: "The bishop is not the same as other bishops. He does not discriminate against your female warlocks. There is no hostility. The bishop even has a female warlock good friend."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female warlock listened to the eyes slightly enlarged, chewing the bread and his face was incredible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Griffin pushed a cup of milk tea: "I think there are many ways to get the information he wants from your mouth with the knowledge of the bishop. Is he really bored to lie to you through this delicious and delicious?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women watched the bread and the fragrant barbecue in their hands, and thought I thought about the unspeakable fear, nodded, and continued to eat silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After ten minutes, the simple lunch is over, the two grooms skillfully pack things up and the carriage continues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the carriage, Su Ge leaned to close his eyes and raise his spirits, and Erha comfortably squatted at the foot of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the opposite seat, the female warlock leaned in the corner with awe, and the slightly pale face of the child’s face whispered: “My name is Pete Mammy, thanks. Thank you for your kindness, thank you for your kindness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge opened his eyes slightly and asked calmly: "I figured it out?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pei features head, looking at Su Ge's dark eyes, she did not see a trace of disgust inside, sly and other looks, like a deep deep, calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So she honestly said: "Ada Newton is a witch."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pate continues: "According to the news from the Glorious Church, Ida Newton is a small kingdom on the southwest side of the Hino continent. The kingdom had perished twelve years ago. At the time of its demise, the 16-year-old Ada Newton was discovered to be a witch. After being caught, it was burned to death."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well?" Su Ge brows and looks at Pete. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Petton felt a heavy pressure and hurriedly explained: "According to the record at the time, she did die. But I don't know why, after about five years. She appeared in the north of the Allied Empire and became a nun. At that time, her kindness and brilliance made countless people addicted to it. Later she was discovered by the Nighthawk Church and executed again in a heretical manner."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This time she disappeared for three years, and she still appears to be a nun in Bain City. But this time weirdly, there is no trace related to her, almost No one knows her, she seems to have left on her own initiative."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly, indicating that she would continue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Petular slightly peace of mind, continue to say: "She seems to be a lot stronger, and then traveled around the mainland, and this tour shows her incredible ability No one can be hostile to her, no one can refuse her kindness. A good person sees that she will be comforted and purified, and become more kind. The wicked will become her crazy believer when she sees her. Then it became a madman in madness and fanaticism."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She... seems to be growing herself in this way. She seems to be doing everything in the world So good, but at the same time it shows the indifference and high above the ordinary people. There seems to be no thing in the world that is worthy of her nostalgia. She constantly spreads her own brilliance, lets countless good people get blessings, makes the wicked become good people, seems to eliminate the world. Everything is dark and evil... But whether he is a good person or a wicked person, he is prone to strange changes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good people do whatever they want to do good things, and even sacrifice their lives for an ant. The bad guys often become out-of-control monsters and madmen because of the turning of the spirit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Su Ge is very calm, just nodded slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the past six months, the Glorious Church has noticed this and started chasing her crazy, but it seems that it is not killing her, but asking her to go back and become a great "The big man."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge asked: "Where did you know the news?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "The intelligence network of the Women's Sisters Association." Pete said a no-nosed term. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where is Ada Newton?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pet’s honest answer: “The more weird thing is that someone saw her in the north near the misty mountains. But some people say that they are seen at the seaside in the southern part of the empire. I have been to her, and I don’t know which one is true.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly into meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is the witch who Joel traces?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pet immediately replied: "Codename Frost Because the attributes are similar to ours, we have had some movements with our female warlocks, and we have secretly helped her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is her destination?'< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Misty Mountains, she seems to be looking for Ada Newton. "Pet said honestly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After knowing this, Su Ge closed his eyes and quickly thought about some of the relationships in his mind.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The power of Ada is not perfect. At her level, human beings are no different from insects in her eyes. The reason why she still has room for her acting style is because I... her weakness, her thoughts are on me. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge has barely known Ada's current form, so there is not much feeling for what she has done.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
