			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Joseph didn't know much. He only knew that they were going to sacrifice here and summon something. As for summoning him, he couldn't tell." It’s very good to take it, as if these words were really spoken from Joseph’s mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerousus has no doubt that he is already in meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking out all that said, Su Ge couldn’t help it, like a heavy eyelid finally falling, Su Ge’s body squatting, leaning on The chair slept. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerousus then returned to God, stood up and walked to Su Ge, reached out and untied Suge’s collar and looked at the two dark sides of his neck. The fingerprints are silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ossen saw this eyelid can not help but jump: "My God, what is going on?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It should have been in the attack of the hypnotist, and almost did not kill himself." Gerlos explained, said to the god of the gods: "Notify Ms. Marlene, escort Su Ge to go home to rest." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, Master!" Orson said, turning and leaving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss turned his head and looked at Su Ge, who was sleeping in the past, and his face flashed a very rare thumb: "Little guy, your effort will win the corresponding Return."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dream, Su Ge stood on the deck and looked at the gray world around him and began to analyze the previous things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Through the experience of the attack, I know that even if I am not in this position, I don’t wear this armor, as long as I am in a dream, I can still control it completely. Take control."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before being attacked by a hypnotist, Su Ge’s consciousness was suppressed by hypnosis at the beginning, he thought it was a real world, a cognitive obstacle Suppressed his instinct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when he heard the words of the hypnotist, he suddenly realized that he was in a dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At that moment, he felt that countless powers appeared in his will, so he easily invalidated all the attacks of the hypnotist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, he crossed his dreams through his own power and summoned his own battleship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The connection between the two gives the ship a precise coordinate, so it breaks the gray wall, enters the world of dreams, and finds the Soviet The nightmare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the battleship approached, Su Ge’s body of God on the battleship returned and instantly merged with Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This experience is invaluable and contains significant clues and knowledge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" First of all, it is now certain that this warship can sail freely in the world of dreams, as long as it has precise guidance. He can appear in the dream of any one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Second: As the power of the dream ruler, I can control anyone's dreams at will and appear in her dreams. But because of the fearless principle, my real damage in my dreams is only Can be seen in the dreams related to dreams, other ordinary people, or other dreams related to dreams, can only appear, can not hurt."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Third: Not only me, but my warriors can also shuttle through dreams. If this is the case, I can sit on the throne very hard, and the soldiers will be the messengers who will pass on my messages and orders in the future. Well, this is more in line with my setting as God."< Br><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Finally, through these judgments that can be determined with certainty, I have always been a god in my dreams, and I can help me in the real world to carry out some necessary deterrence. The existence of this level, even if it only appears, will make a great awe of those mysterious people who are good at brain filling."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This time it was really earned. "Thinking of this, Su Ge was suddenly excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After analyzing the second attack, the thought continued to move forward and came to the first attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The knowledge of sound I have always existed in the original form, only to hear some sounds that others can't hear, let others hear some sounds that should not be heard." The knowledge related to combat is blank."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This time is a huge breakthrough, the sound wave is the sharp edge. I have now mastered the ripples of the bell sound. Through these corrugated blades, you can not only cut the mysterious psionic power, but if used properly, it can become the blade of the physical form. Just like the two blind musicians in Kung Fu."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the future, with the deepening of knowledge, I can get great convenience through sound. And combat power, including echolocation similar to sonar, invisible attacks through sound waves, hypnosis through sound, illusion, and even the formation of sonic and sonic guns."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the vision of the gods, combined with the previous experience, Su Ge thoroughly sees this mysterious route through the development of sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now I can only control the ripples of the bell. To master the ripples of more things, you need to know more about vibration, conduction, and materials. This knowledge allows me to master the sound of more vibrations of objects, making this power of sound more useful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But before this First of all, the sound of the bell must be thoroughly understood. Only the sound of an object can be thoroughly penetrated, and it can be more calm and more powerful when analyzing the sound of other objects."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Su Ge raised his head and his eyes fell on the dark clock at the top of the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just at this time a transparent soul slammed into the bell, slamming, distant and magnificent, and the solemn voice radiated out to the entire world of dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s eyes clearly saw the massive ripples in it, and he had a vision of the gods, and he saw some of the ripples that he did not know, and he had never seen before. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interior of these corrugations has countless tiny particles, which are the particles that are constantly vibrating and diffuse to the surroundings, passing the bells farther. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the transfer, these particles will gradually merge into the air, still with a violent tremor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These tremors gradually settle with the integration of the air, and finally disappear completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "These particles are psionics?" Su Ge's vision of the gods directly sees through the true colors of these particles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
