			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the library. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The black monster should have reached the level of immortality." Luke and Clausen whispered together to discuss the more advanced about the mystery. Mysterious rating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clausen touched his chin and squinted at the window and said, "I can see that the existence of these two is not a true god. It's part of the gods, or the avatar. According to the system left over from ancient times, the black monster's rating is indeed immortal, and that one... should have stepped into that realm."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That form..." Luke flashed a glimmer of heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In rumors, only one person can enter that form in every profession. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because that form is a profession, the source of a rule. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look! Look! The Lord of Death and Storm has a new action!" At this point, there is no need for Hills and Bernice to call. Everyone’s attention is focused on Him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After every move, it involves the nerves of everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge on the throne sits up slightly and lifts his fingers with silver-gray handkerchiefs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, what a lot of souls around Su Ge seem to have gotten orders, turning around to form a wave of death, rushing to the black clock on the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚..................<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a continuous, long and long bell continues Issued, accompanied by a chilly wind blowing throughout the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger looks down on the darkness below and said faintly: "This clock is sent out of death, passed from the abyss, which has pinned countless crickets, countless grievances, countless The wrath, countless sorrows."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight below seems to be inductive, and the body quickly gathers in a neat queue under the throne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chuck's powerful sound like the roar of metal roars through the sky:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This bell is the incarnation of death, the ignorant beast, the subversion of the rules, let The world is attributed to the chaotic goat son, feel honored! Be grateful! This is my gift to you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a sentence for each of the rear knights A god number on the Lord of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Lord of Storms and Death!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The only true God of the Valley and the Abyss!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The ruler of dreams!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The dominator of death!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The master of the fog!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The controller of the sound!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The king of hunters that governs the souls of the dead and the wolves!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Lord of the Frosts that brings the world to silence!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, Su Ge was flat and thick, full of majesty and oppression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Listen! The voice of the late bell passed down from death has been the name of the scorpion, and the countless souls that have risen from the abyss are calling your name, I am based on The wish of the dead soul, give death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, the sound of the late bell sounds to the limit, as if calling for something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge raised his hand and grabbed it in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This catch seems to have caught something intangible, then waved down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗖嗖嗖嗖...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that moment, no one knows what happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But under the horror of everyone, the huge body of the Dark Son was broken down into tens of thousands by mysterious power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The innumerable pieces fell on the ground, and there was a strange whisper that made people look at the black scent of the back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is...substantial death, the birth rule of death!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He changed its structure, even everything about it." Luke held the window and muttered to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clausen’s attention is not here, but the silver rifle in the hands of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The gun, and the bell, can you say that he was in ancient times..." Thinking of this, Clausen dare not say it, clench The lips fell into deep meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside, the dark child, which was broken down into countless pieces, quickly returned to normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although it was restored, how do you feel that something is missing?" Adeline and Rogan, who can read some of the doorways, muttered to themselves. Luke sighed: "He won, the law outside the field has been broken by the sound of this night, the shadow of death is contaminated by its body, its body." The concept of death has been attached, that is, it can be killed and will not heal itself indefinitely."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear all the clergymen turn their eyes Look at Luke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This level of knowledge, this logic is no longer what their heads can understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咩rua嗷嗷! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, the dark son has already felt bad, began to struggle desperately, his arms are waving wildly, and the attack is crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge sat in the throne and said succinctly: "Handle it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Yes! My Lord!" The knights screamed and rushed down from the sky again for a second battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the edge of the battleship, Vanas was there, and there were countless excitements and brilliance in his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything she saw very clearly, she knew that this was not a dream, she knew that it was all true. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I serve Him! As long as He can shelter our country, I can offer everything to Him! What March Church, What Glorious Church, What Sun San Temple, go to hell!" Vanas's mind has been filled with Su Ge, and countless fanatic thoughts continue to echo in her heart, driving her to completely admire under His authority. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the ground, Ron sat on the ice with a smile, watching the dark sons who were constantly being mutilated and unable to heal, without any anger and sadness. Instead, there is a relief and relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Look at it! Finally I saw it! My doubts, my desire, everything about me, have been met. Thanks, Su Ge, It’s the right thing to leave you behind.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, under the attack of the Cavaliers, the Dark Son slowly fell and lost the power of the final action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Win! Win! Really win!" In the library, all embraced together and celebrated like a carnival. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This hell, this desperation, this nightmare, finally has to pass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bloody moon in the sky has gradually fallen, and the sun has a glimmer of light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The darkest moment has passed, and the light is coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge raised his head and found that the entire squad had become very unstable at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Once this law collapses, the rules of the outside world come in, and my existence is likely to be discovered by them, before the sun rises completely, Everything is solved."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Su Ge stood up and stepped on the countless souls to walk down the sky and come to the mortal world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
