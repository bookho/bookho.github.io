			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dinner did not cause any problems with Julie and the young man who left the glasses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas has a strong gas field, self-confidence, full-spirited, and noble and beautiful, people have a natural desire to believe those words. a feeling of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It looks good when you are beautiful." Su Ge grinned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, Vanas attracted the attention and attention of everyone at the banquet, and perfectly controlled the rhythm of the entire dinner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Faced with this moment, Vanas, Marquis Raul and Prince Saku face the hardships because they found themselves completely unplugged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This article prevents the unnecessary misunderstandings, and does not continue to stare at Vanas, but puts his eyes on the surrounding environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Vanas came in, Su Ge made a rough scan of the entire area through the aftermath of his late night, the layout and personnel of the entire manor. Equipped with a simple understanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Su Ge walks easily and leisurely in the vast manor, or wanders in the hall, or goes down the stairs to the second floor, along Dalada in the corridor, or go out from the side door to see the scenery outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This lap came down, and the scene in Su Ge’s mind about Raul’s ambiguity suddenly became a precise 3D perspective. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a lap, Su Ge returned to the hall with a wine glass and looked at the nobles in the middle of the day: "Julie reminded me. Nowadays, the organization with the strongest strength is the Duke of the Mountain Range. There should be a lot of mysterious people on their side. The news that Vanas came to the feast has spread. If the Duke of the Mountain comes, it should not miss this opportunity. It will definitely send the most powerful force directly, demonstrations, and robbing people. Once they come, then a fierce battle is inevitable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Duke Why haven't you come yet? Go on, the group of grasses can be turned down." Not far away, the two nobles whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that Su Ge’s sense of existence is too thin, and they do not know that Su Ge is a man of Vanas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge’s heart came to the interest and pretended to pass by. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My sister is the mistress of the duke. I heard my sister say that the Duke today has a rare military uniform. It seems that there is any action." Another nobleman whispered With a strong sense of superiority on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His companion listened to his envious envy and praised: "You have a good sister..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge heard this, his heart suddenly moved, thinking of a possibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Raised his hand to hold his chin, the brain began to think quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I am the opposite person, when I know that my plan is likely to be exposed at any time, I will act as soon as possible and preemptively. If there are enough people, even It can be a two-pronged approach, even a three-pronged approach."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Su Ge’s brain seemed to have an electric shock, turning on some switches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Calm down, Su Ge, think about the feeling of the analysis of the body and the logic of that thinking..." Su Ge closed his eyes and carefully remembered how he felt before The direction and logic of thinking when using the gods, and the calmness of looking down from a height. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few minutes in the past, Su Ge opened his eyes and could see that the eyes were full of no surprises, no sorrow and no anger, and seemed to have entered a kind of time. That strange realm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now the other party has three forces, the Institute of Polar Studies, the sect of death, the army of the Duke of the Mountains, and these three forces should be being summoned by that The Yi people drive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The kind of highly intelligent Dai thinking should be higher than normal humans, but it should not be as good as my previous thinking, I want to Think... think about it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Institute of Polar Studies corresponds to the plague gases, and the death sect corresponds to the knowledge of the god of death. The book of the Undead is estimated to have a relationship with the god of death. In the end, although the army of the Duke of the Mountain Range has no mysterious power, it has the means to capture the palace by conventional means."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Put on the military uniform, there is action... The gas can be finished this evening... It turns out!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge suddenly figured it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They know that Vanas will go out of the palace today, and the mysterious power of the entire palace is bound to decrease. Then they should be three-pronged today. The Duke of the Mountain led the army to attack the Imperial Palace, occupy the Temple of the Spirit, and at the same time draw the sacrifices. At the same time, through the precise calculation of the Yi people, the plague of the Institute of Polar Studies spread rapidly beyond the speed we expected, infecting the whole city. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the end, Oliver, the master of the strength of the master of the genius, will bring all the mysterious people here, forcing Vanas to take the lead. The timing of the squatting should be the time for the werewolf plague to spread. At that time, the people in the city became werewolves, and of course everyone in this banquet hall!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this Su Ge is suddenly clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know Oliver, if the Duke of the Mountain does not come, and he is coming, then all my speculations will be correct!" The grid slowly squeezed his fists, and the heart was dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately, Su Ge did not rush to tell this to others, but continued to analyze along the known clues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to the situation known from the secret, combined with the other side’s emphasis on Vanas and the Royal Palace, they should be planning to take Vanas as no surprise. At the same time as the mother, replacing the curse, she is also likely to become the carrier of the god of death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mill said that the law requires an attachment, the world Is there anything more suitable than Vanes who has the Guinness family's blood and some knowledge of the god of death?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The ancestors of the Dukes of the Mountains are the Guinness family. The vassal, who was also the deputy of the crusade against the army at the time, was the core figure of the original sacrifice. He should know some of the original secrets."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The book also mentions that God The child needs a nursing mother, a pure virgin that is purely condensed by law. She is the base, she is the umbilical cord, she is the cradle. So Vanas is completely in line with becoming the child's lactating mother. She is a pure virgin, as for the pure law of condensation This, they are very likely to pass some methods, Wanuo Si into witch mentioned in the book, because Wanuo Si constitution can easily be converted into witch "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;</div>
