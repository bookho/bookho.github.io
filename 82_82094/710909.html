			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle between mystery is quite boring, not to mention the perspective of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the ordinary opinion of Su Ge, these people rushed to the opposite side, and then did not know why they fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three archbishops who were together with Mill were even snoring like a break dance, while whispering in their mouths. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle lasted less than five minutes, and the monster group on the Su Ge side was able to easily crush the opposite with absolute quantity and strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than a hundred clergymen can stand at this time, less than twenty people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a violent explosion, the four lords who were fighting together were separated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mill clothes are a bit smashed, there is still a lot of blood on his body, and his face looks very embarrassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But a closer look reveals that he only has everything worn out and his body has not suffered any injuries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the opposite of the three archbishops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Archbishop, who was able to release the wind, was cut off by Mil's sword at this time, and his blood stained his half body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bicular bishop's skin is black and it seems to have been burned by the horrible temperature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Laurie is pale, his shoulder has a black bullet hole, the back and chest are full of knife wounds, and even the blood flowing out becomes strange. Black, seems to be poisoned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle of the demon hunters does not have any so-called tradition and restraint. They are similar to the killers. As long as they can kill the enemy, all means are at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I just saw that Mill released the spell just as a starter, then threw a few banned bombs, followed by the knife, and gave himself Plus intensive surgery, anti-mystery shell shield, while using the spirit disturbance spell to block the release of several people's spells, and rushed to chase. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ordinary mystery can't do this at all, but Mill is a lord-level hunter! Taking the top dragon potion, the knowledge of the lord level can make the scattered knowledge self-acting, thus completing the cooperation of one team with one person's strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cough.........<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three people coughing at this time, can see three people Both suffered from varying degrees of toxins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is reasonable to say that this toxin has already taken their lives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the three men are still quite strong at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can't see, the previous three children like wild dogs have now got the blessing of the sky mark." Mill spit out a sigh of relief. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sky Marks?" This saint Saug heard more than once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few runes in the world that symbolize the origin of the world. Only those big churches with strong beliefs are qualified to hold this mark, just like an elf. The Order, holding the holy mark of the lake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Church of the Holy Blood holds the most important and highest-ranking sky mark of all the holy marks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the most advanced holy mark, the sky mark can bear three vows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three vows are also officially made, so that all those who bear the holy mark have absolute confidentiality to the holy mark itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even Luke, who bears the sacred mark, can’t now tell what effect the sky mark has. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three archbishops leaned together, and although they were physically embarrassed, they felt that the attack of Mill did not hurt their mysterious aspects, and now they still have a very good mysterious fighting power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Laurie took a deep breath and didn't know where to take an injection to hit his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the injection of the injection, it can be seen that the wound of his whole body heals quickly at a speed visible to the naked eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the face of this time, Mill did not rashly attack, the expression on his face became somewhat dignified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next side of Su Ge asked: "What effect does the sky mark have?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Mil whispered: "The detailed effect is only known to those who accept the holy mark. I have been fighting several times with the church in March, and I have faintly explored some of the power of the sky mark."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Talk about it." Su Ge is very curious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mill looked at the three people who were confidently injecting blood medicine, and whispered: "I have fought with a few people with holy marks, let me The most unbelievable thing is that whenever they are attacked by what I think they can kill them, these attacks seem to be suddenly weak or ineffective. After being confronted, these people still live like three people." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Su Ge suddenly thought of something, watching three people say: "That is, if they encounter a fatal attack, the sky will be extremely Greatly improve their patience with death, and at the same time greatly reduce the power of this deadly attack."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mill some accidents, he did not expect Su Ge actually I quickly caught the point that he didn't have time to sum up,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't want to be an adult!" The whole body is bloody, Jean and Michelle are full. It is uplifting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge explained: "I have met before, so pay attention to it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few days ago, in order to rescue the female warlocks, Su Ge had a positive encounter with Mrs. Merris. At that time, Mrs. Merris accepted the sanctuary of the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the funeral, Su Ge thought she was dead. It was only after the next night that Merris did not die and left a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg was not too surprised at the time, because he instantly thought that it was a problem that was probably a holy mark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The funeral of the late bell is a powerful spell that Suge condenses by borrowing the sacred hunter and the god of the late bell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This spell can ignore the strength of the psionic power, can ignore the difference of types, and directly cause instant death in phenomena and concepts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This death is inevitable and cannot be weakened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This concept is so powerful that it is so powerful that no human being can escape and resist. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now combining the words of Mill and the three archbishops, Su Ge’s simple calculations, he found that the sky mark seems to have extremely strong cushioning, the holy mark should be The power of the funeral of the late bell was reduced by about 95%. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately this trick is too horrible, even if it is 5% of the power, it also makes Merris become so embarrassed, and only her life is dead It was extended for three days in the stagnation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this is already very scary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The special ability of the sky streak with three vows is definitely more than this, which is why Mill does not dare to attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows the Church of the Holy Blood very well, and he knows that there is too much hidden in this ancient city with a history of nearly 10,000 years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don’t fully understand the sky, you will continue to attack and only find death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We who have the sanctuary of the sky are not dead." The one-eyed bishop is out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge snorted: "Let's brag here, if you don't die, you can attack me and try."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, the three men looked at each other without answering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can see that they still have no courage to face the anger of a god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The clock is very different." This is, Michelle suddenly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge turned slightly: "Is the reinforcements of the church coming?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes! Lots The mysterious mystery, including the scepter, the night watchman, the hunter, looks at at least 500, is approaching here through the fog... and so on!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Michelle didn't wait to finish, his face suddenly pale: "There is a...comparable..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice is not finished, Su Ge is mortal The field of vision saw that the fog around it was gradually filled with dark red, as if something was burning after the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s finally here!" Seeing this red, Laurie and others’ hearts suddenly felt relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mil's face turned solemnly: "This burning scent is the flame dominator of the elders."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dominator!" Hearing this, the werewolves and the vampires trembled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dominator, that is the real existence of horror, the kind of person who has absolute control over knowledge can enter that state and become the dominator of the knowledge of one party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The church actually dispatched the dominator!?" The church that had just arrived here was very surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mir is full of strength and turns to look at Su Ge: "What should I do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su The grid is still calm, faintly said: "Wait."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The very ordinary five words suddenly made everyone feel a kind of inexplicable Peace of mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temperature around it is rising rapidly, and even the sweat on the head of Mill has appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Su Ge did not feel anything, this is not the sanctuary of Shenwei, but the protection of the world for ordinary people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After about half a minute, the fog around it disappeared completely in a slow tumbling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And after the fog, the attire is different, and the black-pressed clergy have completely surrounded it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the sky, a man is burning around with a hot flame, and the vague man stands in the air, looking down at everything on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge raised his head to see him, indicating that this is still a person, not in the system of vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes covered by the flames looked like the king and looked down on the ground, then the eyes fell on Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people staring at each other, Su Ge saw a pair of brownish yellow, like a glassy transparent eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These eyes seem like countless sands and crystals have experienced the burning of countless flames, forming a transparent and dry crystal texture that looks like a human An unspeakable surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Flame Dominator!" Mill looked at the sky with his eyes tightened and muttered in his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dominator is the person who begins to contact the rules. They have mastered many rules of the world through their own knowledge. Through these laws, they can show many powerful people. presence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because they can go to this step, their purpose is not to fight, but to evolve and evolve their form toward a higher level of existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dominator!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the werewolves and vampires below see this, All grow a little. The flame beside him is like having a life of oneself, constantly changing his own form, and facing such a strange and incomprehensible form, their inner feelings are faintly fearful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dominator is standing still in the sky, everyone underneath is dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge psionic power is like a downward pressure in the sky, so that everyone in the church in the late bells has tremendous mental stress, and the look becomes uneasy and the face changes. pale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dead, a large number of clergymen are slowly surrounded by this side, and the bloody smell of chilling people has a kind of hell in the soul of judgment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge lost the night of the soul of the town, he could not use his previous means to appease his followers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But since he lost, Su Ge didn’t care. He opened his mouth at this critical moment and said something like ordinary people, there seems to be no power. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you come down? I have a stiff neck."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a time, the silence here, the chill here, all because of this sentence to the destruction of the ruin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clergyman looked at Su Ge incredibly, and it seemed like saying: You dare to talk to the dominator like this! ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame dominator in the sky is also very surprised, so that the Church of the Holy Blood loses its face, and is now regarded as a affliction by the Church of the Holy Blood. Su Ge Sotos, seeing his first sentence, is such a naive and ridiculous discourse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is where Su Ge continues his own words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I only saw him rub his neck and looked around and continued: "This battle is really good, very horrible, but unfortunately, if only these people Still, not our opponent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one laughed at Su Ge’s arrogance because of this, Su Ge has shown too Too much makes them feel incredible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lauri wants to talk, but is raised by the dominators in the air to stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stepped on two flames on his feet, slowly landing from the air, standing in front of Su Ge three meters with a hot air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flames dissipated, and people found that the flame dominator was a somewhat thin, energetic old man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man is not tall, some hunchback, but has a rare red hair and eyebrows, symbolizing his identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame-dominated glazed eyes carefully looked at Su Ge at this time, and finally the eyes fell on the gloves of Su Ge’s right hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who can think that the Holy Grail of the Soul that appeared in the ancient city of Aya actually puts you in your hands like this." The flame dominator made some old, but very ordinary the sound of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not the red hair and eyebrows, if it’s not the glazed eyes, he’s placed in any place like the most ordinary person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge raised his right hand and exposed his hand to the diamond-shaped jewel, which attracted everyone’s attention in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the legend, the symbol of the roots, only the holy grail that the gods can master! It is the root of the source and the witness of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You seem to want him very much." Su Ge looked around and said calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
