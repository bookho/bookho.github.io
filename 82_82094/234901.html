			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ron stood on the ice, looked up at the figure at the bow, suddenly thought of something, and hurriedly turned to find Su Ge's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at this moment he suddenly discovered that Su Ge’s body did not know when it had disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It turns out! It turns out!" Ron seemed to figure out what was going on, not only without anger, but with a very happy smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hahaha! It turns out! It turns out! Little guy, you are so interesting, I didn't expect you to have taught me so much knowledge!" Ron I am very happy to laugh, that kind of happiness is even a little naive, like a child who just learned a math problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bishop adult! What should I do now??" Others gathered at this time, and their attitudes were full of worries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ron said casually: "We just look at it, remember our purpose, we are exploring the unknown pioneers and pioneers, sacrificing and killing. It is the means to the true knowledge, not the purpose."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sky, Su Ge, standing at the bow of the ship, looks at the monster on the ground, his eyes flashing: "And It’s not gauze and nicholas. It’s just a dark child with a part of the gauze. As a three-column, she is not the summoned by this summoning array. Otherwise, at the level of existence, the summoned moment, The entire space in the array will be completely crushed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the essence of the monster, Su Ge said casually: "Let you be a dark man, You are not qualified to be called the Mori Black Goat, the little one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simple confirmation of the darkness, the glance of Sug’s eyes Holy Blood Library. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, Su Ge instantly saw the essence of the library. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a library at all, but a human skull! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What kind of human skull can be mutated to this extent!" Su Ge was secretly surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this matter did not occupy too much energy. Su Ge quickly gathered his spirit: "This time is my debut, how the performance determines the positioning of our late church and the loyalty of believers in the future, so it must be full. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Su Ge began to use his omnipotence, slightly raised his hand and waved freely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, the countless souls that wandered through the space, energy, and bones floated directly from the ground to the sky as if they had life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is!!!" Others saw this completely silly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the collapse of the rules, they can now see a lot of things without the sight of the rules of vision, those energies, souls, bones, etc. can be seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under their gaze, the dead souls are like diligent workers, they hold the skeleton, use mysterious energy as a material to float in midair Countless souls are the foundation, and the speed visible to the naked eye has built a huge sacral throne that is five meters high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge throne floats in midair and is carried by thousands of dead souls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are the remaining dead souls one by one to form a bridge of dead souls and steps to the throne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge stepped forward, stepped out of the penetration, stepped on the body of countless dead souls and strolled to the throne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hula! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cloak greets the cold wind, and Sug is sitting on the throne of the cheekbones, looking down at the ground without feelings, saying that he came here first. In the words: "The ants, your actions angered me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no tone, no feelings, but there is a kind of unquestionable and resistant Power, and unspeakable majesty and domineering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pump! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clerics around Ron on the ground, all the clerics, including Father Gail, all stunned instinct on the ground after hearing this voice . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is this the so-called god power?" Ron became more and more excited at this time, muttering to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Saint Library. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God!" Everyone was completely shocked by this scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This...this is the power of the gods!" Clawson widened his eyes and returned to God for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogen looked at the sky and muttered: "Jerouss, your feelings are really accurate. There is a big man in Su Ge. But I don't think you have any I thought that this character... is so big that it is beyond the limit that all of us can imagine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咩rua嗷呜......< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very weird and harsh voice came out of the monster’s countless mouths, and seemed to be very dissatisfied with the title of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug elbows on the armrests, lifted his fingers and pointed slightly downwards: "Little guy, your mother may be eligible to sit on my side, But you can't."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whw...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instant, dozens of rides huge The Knight of the Ghost Wolf vacated from the battleship and floated in the air on the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Warrior, sanctioning the death of the deceased."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sound is extremely loud, Everyone in the church heard this majestic and sound voice suddenly awe and a deep worship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;噼里啪......轰隆............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment you can see that all the soldiers are in the hands The long guns were lifted, and then there were countless lightning storms, accompanied by the cold wind condensing around the gun body. For a moment, each knight was holding a rifle, but a compressed storm gun! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This storm gun only looks like it, no matter how far it is, you can feel the power of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the real power! Every knight has such power, then..." Luke whispered in his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Storm!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knights screamed and the long guns in their hands were thrown collectively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, dozens of glaring storms tear the night sky like a meteor that is entangled with frost, falling from the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark sons on the ground felt the threat, and the countless tentacles extended in an instant, calling the knights at a strange speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, however, the dozens of long guns linked to each other have formed a huge storm of terror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, everyone feels a huge amount of pressure, and the person who presses can't breathe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because everyone feels at this time, it’s not dozens of rifles, but the whole sky! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With dozens of lances as the center, this has created a huge horror of horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This cone-shaped whirlwind draws countless lightning, countless frosts, countless black clouds, countless gusts of wind, giving a sky with a rifle , descending from the sky, shot to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of pressure is the level of collapse! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The true God is on, God!" At this moment everyone was shocked and looked out of the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exception is this, when the old priest in Water is sitting in a wheelchair leaning against the corner, not looking up, squinting his eyes and gently touching his crutches. Leisurely, I don’t seem to care about the situation outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The storm-like rifle collided with the tentacle, and instantly crushed the tentacles into the finest ice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the storm did not weaken, falling from the sky, the horrible "Heavenly Gun" directly stabbed the huge body of the Dark Son. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
