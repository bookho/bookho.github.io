You are looking for death!" He whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s mouth still has a calm and casual smile: “The bishop’s eyes are not easy to use, then I will wipe the eyes of the bishop. The Holy Blood Church has always been It is the head of the three churches. Is it because our church has blinded its eyes, or is it that you sit down and look at the sky and use your narrow eyes to speculate on other people's wise decisions!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon hearing this, Sapir gradually calmed down and looked down at the hundreds of tiny cracks in his body, as if he had been cut by countless knives at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And just how Su Ge did it, and how to operate the psionic power, he did not notice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge walked from the two people to the sand table and looked down at the terrain of the misty mountains and said calmly: "Now the fog should only cover the top of the mountain." At a distance of about forty meters, it is estimated that after two days of fog, the ancient city will appear again. How do the two plan now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Relatively sleek Horace took the lead in returning to God and said: "I just discussed with Sapir's bishop. Because of the danger ahead, we naturally have to join in and retreat. After the foggy mountains, we will take the lead of our three churches to form a temporary The coalition forces went to the top of the mountain to find out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jenny continued to explain: "According to the feedback from the explorers, the ancient city of Central Asia has no idea why, It appeared from the ruins, and the city seemed to be very neat, with no sand and gravel."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sapir slowly spit out and came over and said: I have already talked to the Glorious Church and the Fortress, this one. Love is not a personal problem of an organization. As for the mystery of individual and small organizations, it is not enough to worry about it, but a group of mice, although a little annoying, is not enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How many people have you brought in this time? We intend to surround all the exits of the entire city to prevent heretics from escaping." Horace asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger said casually: "Because of the rush, I brought nine people to come, all of them are elite. The Holy See is preparing for the expeditionary army, estimated two days." Just arrived."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On nine people!?" The two were somewhat unhappy at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge looked down at the sand table and said: "This is the elite of the elite. When it comes to the authority of the goddess, you really think that the central hospital will put Are you coming?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having heard this, the two men gradually settled down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Involving the authority of the goddess, as long as the clergy of the three churches do not dare to have the slightest care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The fog has not dissipated, but it does not mean that you can not explore and search. I will find time to take my people and see for myself." Su Ge turned and prepared to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, the two people were shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fog is weird, even if neither of them dare to walk into the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past few days of exploration, their spies have died more than a dozen, not being taken away from the heart, or being frozen into ice sculptures by the power of terror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The form of this power, they have never encountered it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, I heard Bishop Sapir seized a witch!?" Su Ge turned his head and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sapir nodded: "What is wrong with Bishop Sotos?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I I want to see this witch," said Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sapir squinted: "Just look?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three churches each Mastering a maze of dungeons means that each of the three churches has mastered the body of an ancient god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most convenient way to ask for knowledge from a corpse is to sacrifice a witch, so for many years, the witch is an important strategic resource for the three churches. In this regard, three The Great Church has had a lot of friction and is very vigilant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled: "In your camp, are you afraid that I stole it? And now there are so many people watching it, let’s look at each other. Because the witch is fighting, let other people see the joke, I can't afford this crime."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bishop Sotos wants to see what the witch is doing? Witch The dangers are obvious to all, I am responsible for the safety of the bishop, so this is probably not very convenient," Sapir said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled: "Don't be nervous, Bishop Sapir, I just talked about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Speaking, a dark cloak walked out of the camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Su Ge left, the two men looked at each other with a cold sigh and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be seen that the relationship between the two is also very bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the northeast corner of the camp, Alger and Hills are carrying out tents, brackets, bedding, and daily necessities with a few werewolf soldiers to build the camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mature and restrained sound wave sits on the side of the book looking at the hand, the nun's veil obscures her gray hair, looks like a beautiful and dignified nun Any difference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge walked over and said: "Just used the knowledge you gave me to explain the wavelength and amplitude direction, and the effect of using the binding technique is very good." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that cut Sapir’s clothes is the restraint of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He let the psionic thread of the original bondage constantly vibrate at an ultra-high speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High-speed rotating rags can easily cut steel plates, and as long as there is enough speed, water droplets can even penetrate the bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These psionic threads become numerous sharp edges when they oscillate at high speeds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound wave was a little shocked after listening to the expression: "Will you have it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was originally I have a certain foundation. Let me say that all my knowledge is produced through practice. What is missing is the standards you just said, the foundation of the class. You speak very well, and naturally listen very thoroughly." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, Su Ge raised his hand and said with a little regret: "Unfortunately, it still needs constant optimization. Just that bondage has consumed me a third. The psionic power, without any real value."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge's psionic power is five times that of ordinary people! One third is consumed at a time, and it can't be successful if it is put on other people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to the sound wave, he then asked: "Have you just used the night hawk bishop to give Ma Wei?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know!?" Su Ge stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound wave refers to the ear: "The sound is not there from nowhere, but it is very subtle, even negligible vibration. Of course, people's ears can't be heard. But I am different."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about the wind? The master method is really amazing." Su Ge sighed in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic closed the book and asked: "Is this high-profile suit? You feel more restrained and low-key."<br /><br />&nbsp Suge casually sat down and said: "Introverted and low-key is because their strength is not enough, showing the enemy a weak means. Playing pigs and eating tigers is the means and mentality of the weak. I used to be weak so I want to keep a low profile. But I am already strong now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Su Ge snorted: "Who has a tendency to abuse? Since it has strength, why do you want it? Let others continue to humiliate, and endure to fight back in the end? It is not low-key and patience, it is an idiot and metamorphosis."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, my world view is very simple, who bullies You, you will bully, who wants to kill you, who will kill you first. In those years, I did not have enough power to break the shackles of the shit law. Now that there is strength, it is natural to have a strong party. Arrogant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sneer on the face gradually became proud: "Otherwise why? Individuals want to be stronger and stronger? Only with enough power can they have the freedom to break the rules."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound sinks and says: "It's like that kind of Cynical, I was greatly bullied."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stop, she smiled abruptly: "But it is very appetizing to me, because I am such a person." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Haha! That's right!" Su Ge smiled happily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a simple conversation, Su Ge continued to speak his own knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Including sound bursts, accumulation and morphological changes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My current methods include the sound wave blade, but now the power is not great for the mystery. There is also the sound shield, this is still very practical, but It can only offset one attack; it also has the effect of vibrating through the material to produce a cow across the mountain. Finally, it is the usage of the shackle. I have a lot of usage in my imagination, but there is no obvious clue."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
