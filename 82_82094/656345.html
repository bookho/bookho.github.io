			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug stretched a bit of a sore body and snorted comfortably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bed of Shirley's palm supports the side of the head lying on it, the graceful body half-covering, revealing the infinite charm and temptation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What should the four female warlocks handle?" Shelly asked lazily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time in the living room, there are still four female warlocks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I came back quietly last night and brought back four female warlocks, such as Iyeta. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the temporary settlement, Su Ge returned from Lobo through a special connection with the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, a big dog is really too prominent to stay here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger leaned back and stretched his waist and said, "I have already thought about where to settle them."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wearing clothes to wash, two people stand on one side and brush their teeth, while blurry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You said that this is a game yesterday, what did you find?" Shirley asked a bubble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug shook his head: "Although I haven't found anything special yet, it makes me even more uneasy."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you mean, the Church of the Holy Blood may have a bigger plot?" Shelly wiped her mouth and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge retched and spit out the bubble: "The whole plot is hidden deep, and the whole clue is very fragmentary, and the time period is very long, if not Vana Remind me that I can't remember."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mrs. Merris is a member of the Church of the Holy Blood, who wants to do it with her status and means. It should be easy. Why she hasn’t done so yet, it’s very likely that she has received orders from some people and will not let her do it.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After a while, the Church of the Holy Blood discovered my existence, but I have never taken much of it. The good estimate I have hidden is only one aspect. On the other hand, they are likely to observe us in secret, accumulating means. Prepare for a hit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speaking of this, Su Ge’s face is dignified: “Even if the person planning the plot has extremely powerful calculation skills, he even has I calculated that I might have a relationship with a noble celebrity, and then I will come to Mrs. Merris’s dinner. Mrs. Merris cooperated with the Lengbu Church, even the blood-hunter I killed at the time, and the one I took. Female ghouls are the bureaus they set."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They touched my habit very thoroughly, knowing that I will see this kind of thing "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley listened to the dark eyes and rarely flashed a glimmer of light: "You have the protection of the Holy Grail, no divination or prophecy can judge you." Location. But as long as they have mastered With sufficient footprint and breath, it is very likely that you will determine your location and presence through the causality of these mysterious events."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge will chin on the chin Scratched cleanly, looking at the handsome young man in the mirror, smiled and said: "But I am not afraid of them, my backhand will go far beyond their imagination. I also hope that through this opportunity, the night will be The sound spreads throughout the world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You seem to be in a hurry." Shelly said with her hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge silenced and nodded: "I feel faint, leaving us with less time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The time to dig into the truth of the old world." Su Ge said earnestly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl thought for a moment: "Let's get to know this, let's go to the North Wind, where you have the answer you want."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know it doesn't mean you know. Some knowledge, some history, only you I can only understand it if I have witnessed it. It does not make sense to pass the dictation of others."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;..................<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the simple breakfast, Su Ge said to the four female warlocks: "You are temporarily resting here, and the safe place is very fast. It can be arranged properly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes! Master." Ieta replied wildly at this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the form of Su Ge last night, Iyeta has now become a fanatic of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug shakes his head and says, "You don't have to call my master, just call me an adult."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that, he looked at Niya, who was sitting at the side reading: "What are your plans?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Niya said: "I have informed the steam guild When they arrive, I will go to them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, does the steam guild know your identity?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, but they don't care, those people are determined and unbelievers." Niya said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's good." Sug turned and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Niya suddenly got up and asked, "Teacher, also in the church, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Su Ge nodded and did not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there really a god?" Niya looked very seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled: "Go ask your teacher, she has not only seen, but also received gifts."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, the spirit of Ieta was shocked, and even the three female warlocks with a dull face had some light in their eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although they don’t know who the teacher of this female warlock is, they obviously get important news from this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female warlock not only saw, but even got the gift of the gods! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge left alone at home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley must stay at home, Ieta’s loyalty is guaranteed, but the other three female warlocks are not sure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger’s goal today is to find Duke. On the one hand, he hopes that Duke will help him to receive the four female warlocks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, the antique that Duke said has arrived, and Su Ge is still very curious about the ancient book of the book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just out of Beth Street, Su Ge ran into the pipe of Father Sini. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where are you going?" asked Sieg. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge replied casually: "Go to see a friend, how can the priest have time to come here today?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Sini did not answer, the turbid eyes flashed a hint of purple light and suddenly asked: "What do you think of the ancient sense?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good One person," Su Ge said simply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sini smiled, but this smile was a bit cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is challenging the authority of the goddess."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s heart jumps: "He What happened to you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French Sini relied on the wall to say faintly: "He recently declared what doomsday theory, not only caused some panic It also caused those people to offend the goddess."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He actually said it so generously!?" Hearing this, Su Ge was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French Sini looks at Su Ge: "Do you know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug knows that he just He lost his words, so he went down and said, "Well, he told me before he drank too much, but I didn't take it seriously."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
