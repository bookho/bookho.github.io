			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After finishing his own intelligence, Bart naturally can't just let Sue go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now my purpose is clear, then you should answer me." Bart replied with the words of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly and asked, "What do you want to know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart pick up The cup said: "Cooperation is based on mutual understanding. I don't mean anything else. I just want to investigate the situation of the cooperation. Your organization, your situation, your beliefs, I have to know. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge was silent, and his mind flashed, and he immediately thought of a response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he leaned his legs and leaned against the back of the chair, calmly said: "I can talk to you and naturally have my own capital. You know I am a priest. You know, I am not the goddess of the March goddess. Then the problem is coming!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge mouth slightly tilted up and stared Bart said: "Which priest I am?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard, Bart’s face gradually became solemn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point he thought of a possibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s impossible for a small apprentice apprentice to know these things. Even if he is a genius, the people above will not say these things. This guy is a senior member of a church, or even a direct agent who can communicate directly with the gods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge continues to calmly say: "My Lord Knowing a lot of things, he knows everything about this world. Who is your faith, what is his name, what ability he has, and who his servant is, everything is clear to me, and told me "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Bart's hand was a little trembling, hurriedly pressed under his leg to make himself look calmer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a core person, Bart once heard it once, and above their beliefs, there is a more horrible, even unspeakable name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That name is not even known to the entire Green Flame Brotherhood, but at this time the little priest actually knows! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He no longer dared to look directly at Su Ge and looked down at the coffee, which was like a student who had just made a mistake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This kind of top secret information can't be randomly written. This guy is probably a container of choice for a god. Otherwise it will never give Give him so much horror knowledge. Maybe one day, He will come directly to this guy and appear in the world." But the more he wants to be afraid, the more he wants to be more awe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is very satisfied with this effect and continues to blow his own cowhide: "But you can rest assured that my Lord is not the same as the evil spirits you believe in, He It is a truly great, intellectual and benevolent existence. Whether you believe in it or not, you will receive the protection and reward of my Lord if you can please my Lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Hearing this Bart looked up, his expression was full of uncertain questions: "Is it true?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge put down his leg and whispered: "I I can give you a bottom. Our Lord not only has human believers, but also witches and even non-human believers. My fraternity is a true high-level fraternity that transcends race and prejudice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Witch?" Bart listened to more surprises. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The group of guys has a mysterious sarcoma that cannot be removed. According to his intelligence, it comes from a high-level powerful force that ordinary people can’t control at all. And contact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That kind of thing is equivalent to an unstable bomb, a taboo for all organizations and churches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one wants to get along with them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But also, such a strong presence, dealing with the hidden dangers of the witch is still very calm."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Su Ge saw that he was completely caught in Bart and decided to end the talks: "Well, I will say it today. Some things can't be said, or your vision can't stand it."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart did not continue to ask, at this time asked: "What is your church called?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Hearing this, Su Ge fell silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Church? We don't have churches, where do we know what the church is called?" Su Ge suddenly spit in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bad quietly waiting, no questioning. At this time, for Su Ge, he must maintain enough humility and respect. Because this person is likely to be the embodiment of a god in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, Su Ge has been immersed in contemplation for more than ten seconds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These ten seconds, Su Ge thought a lot of names, what storm church, death and storm church, fog church, ice church, etc., but these names are Not very praying what he thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, he suddenly thought of the bells coming from time to time on the ship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Su Ge’s mind flashed in a faint light and said: “At night, we are the church of the late bell.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The evening church..." Bart remembered silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug continued: "As for our beliefs, you are not qualified to know the relationship between you and me. Let us establish a close and intimate relationship, You will know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After seeing Su Ge disappear into the night, Bart was relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bishop, how about?" Jike asked from the side to test, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bart’s shock in his heart calmly said: “Take him as a key partner and try his best. He is a clergyman and very helpful in dealing with the rebel party. Maintaining an absolutely good relationship, in the future, we can get from him. A lot of benefits."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understand! Bishop!" Jike nodded after listening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 7:30 in the evening, Su Ge returned home, just to see Winnie sitting at the table in the living room looking at the book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is prepared food on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
