			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hui Yaocheng, the Church of the Holy Blood Church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How can things become like this?" Saru and Laurie look very ugly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of an accidental coincidence, not only did the two people plan to completely strand, but even the entire city was in danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opposite of the two is the black pharaoh who is called the apostle of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Pharaoh was calm and his eyes were deep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, his expression at this time also appeared unnatural. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the young man who was named Naia Latotip by the Black Pharaoh finally learned the basic human common sense and began to move freely in the capital. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was everything going in the direction they expected, but in an accident the day before yesterday, they not only lost the helper of Naia Latotip. And even caused a lot of trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The youth who belonged to the past undead, thousands of years ago, was the third dynasty of the sands, a king of the Calding dynasty, named Nether Karl Ding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This king is mysterious and is a mysterious person with a dominator level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His occupation is the priest of the priests who have been extinct, and the object of sacrifice is naturally the existence of their worship, known as the god of the king of yellow clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nether, he has been working hard to make the king of yellow clothes come again and continue to study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too much obsessed with the king of yellow clothes, he completed a deal with his yellow seal and the great king of yellow clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The content of the transaction is unknown. Only since then, this wise king has begun to become murderous and incompetent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is obsessed with mysterious rituals every day, cruelly treating all the people he sees as sacrifices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After many years of raging, even the other Kardin royals could not stand the existence of Nether, so they jointly killed and sealed them in the grave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, no one knows that even himself and Black Pharaoh do not know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the moment of his death, his horrible mental power lost his physical limitations and was greatly extended and released. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that moment, he reached out to the great existence through the contract. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then, the ghost named Nether in the world is no longer an ordinary undead, with a great king of yellow clothes Half angle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has become a part of the king of yellow clothes and has become the most suitable anchor for the king of yellow clothes in this world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day before he strolled through the city, he saw Su Ge, because he was the tool that Black Pharaoh used to test Su Ge, so he instinctively followed Su Ge Go ahead and try to tentatively test this ordinary person who looks weak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But when he walked to a certain place, Nether felt that he was greatly attracted, and that feeling was like what he had been missing. Calling yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The source is actually the clinic where Su Ge came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he took the initiative to use the camouflage technique that Black Pharaoh gave him, disguised as a passerby in another direction, and followed Suge into the clinic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After crossing the barrier to isolate psionics, his ego is greatly attracted to the indescribable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman, the woman who is like a black hole attracts him crazy, and his instinct is almost crazy and wants to be with this woman. After complementarity, a new existence is formed, completing the self-complement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the existence of Su Ge, he reluctantly suppressed his desire to leave temporarily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Su Ge left, he cut off contact with the Pharaoh and the church and returned to the clinic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, he knows why he is here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not to trace the whereabouts of Huang Yin, nor to become a person’s subordinates and running dogs, nor to experience this new world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only purpose of his coming here is to fulfill himself and realize his great ideals that span thousands of years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, he has achieved it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strongest anchor in the world, with the world's strongest container, completes the fusion through a common sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is beyond everyone’s expectations, including the church that plans everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where is the king of yellow clothes?" Silence for a long time, Laurie tempted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Pharaoh eyes looked around: "He is everywhere."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wind Sand Huang Yi once came to this land.” Black Pharaoh said calmly, just as he was the witness of the matter, and everything he experienced had the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "On the first advent, a group of humans eager for knowledge signed a contract with him, and the third dynasty of the sands was established."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;! ! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, the two archbishops who knew countless secrets were shocked because they didn’t even know it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Pharaoh continues to say plainly: "When the second advent, He took back the possession of the contract that He deserved, and the third dynasty of the sands was destroyed." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two archbishops at the lord level heard this heart tremble, and Laurie tempted and asked: "What is the contractual possession that caused a dynasty to die?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Pharaoh’s eyes were cold and ironic: “On the first landing, ignorant and ignorant humans said they were willing to contribute everything.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Naturally, everything is what humans have said."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One...cut!?" Two people felt their hearts tremble constantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third dynasty of the sandstorm lasted for nearly two thousand years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Calding dynasty was built with the knowledge given by the King of Yellow, then everything here represents the existence of the entire empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black pharaoh's tone is calm and chilling: "The millennial empire, because of his rise, will naturally be destroyed by Him. This is cause and effect. All endings, It has already been doomed at the very beginning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two people looked at each other in horror, feeling flustered and feeling that their previous plan had been completely messed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Apostle, what should I do next? Then...that is a true God!" Saru said with a trembling voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of countless humans and mysteries, master the central archbishops of countless deaths and deaths, the mysterious masters at the lord level, facing the true God is still so confused and helpless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Pharaoh faint answer: "God, can only be confronted by gods. The goddess now sleeps in the dream, destroying the ancient evil spirits, if you want to resist yellow The king of clothes must create a new god, even if it exists for a moment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, two people thought of Drake’s belly at the same time. The sealed evil spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You two don't have to bother with this matter, the problem of making God is now officially handed over to the saints, and they will deal with that evil spirit. You two The goal remains the same. Although the capital is chaotic, it is also a good opportunity. Grab the Sog Sotos."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!" Nod hardly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
