			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When two people spoke, they had already walked out of the palace and looked north, just to see the poles that were supported on the site of the Cathedral of the Holy Blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not a conservative, so I don't mind if the Queen and her aides are witches. We have a way to keep the witch stable for a long time. You can give them to you later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your kindness." Su Ge said earnestly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As for the second special institution, called Star Heaven." Emilia continued her own explanation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the place where the Virgin is in charge. The detailed situation is not convenient for you to know now, you will know later."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded: "Okay, I know so much truth today, I am very satisfied and grateful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Emilia smiled softly and looked at the guards passing by in the distance. She looked forward with a tone: "This is a good place. I have already suppressed the identity of their werewolf. Others don't know. I hope you can help." I managed this land."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger slowly straightened his waist and said with a touch of pride: "Reassure, Archbishop, in the future This will be your sharpest secret blade and the safest base camp."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emilia turned slightly and glanced at Sug, pink lips The angle is slightly raised: "I am looking forward to it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This smile is different in the kind of smile on the peace day, this smile With a trace of aloof, with a trace of arrogance, with a hint of Italian overlooking high above. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This moment, Su Ge is a bit embarrassed, because this smile can not be described. This smile, it is not an exaggeration to describe it with a pour into the country, just like the female emperor who is in the world, revealing the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, the basics are finished, let me see what you have in mystery!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emilia is a more versatile existence than Gylos. She seems to know everything. Astronomical geography, chemical history, up to mysterious secrets, down to the technique of swearing, all say that Su Ge thinks thoroughly and suddenly realizes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One month, under the guidance of the Emilia system, and with the addition of a large number of mysterious books, Sugna’s broken and messy body system was completely completed. All, while possessing expert strength, even have the knowledge and knowledge comparable to the master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, a month after her, Su Ge from her words and demeanor, speaking style, movement, and people's speaking skills, etc. I got a very deep understanding and learning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emeria also uses her own practical actions to teach her how to become a qualified bishop in a territorial territory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the morning, Su Ge woke up in meditation, did not wear his black suit after taking a bath in the bath, but was black, with golden lines Bishop's robe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishop's gown is divided into four parts, robe, lining, shoulder pads, and pants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First put on a white inner shirt, buckle the button on the neckline, and put on a slim fit gown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The overall appearance of the robe is the improvement of the suit, the upper body is slim and tidy, the chest has a golden symbol of the Church of the Holy Blood, and the neckline has a bishop's badge. The collar, shoulders and embroidered edges have a delicate dark gold grain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hem of the robes is slightly looser and slightly longer, up to the knees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lower body is wearing black gold embroidered trousers, and finally some large shoulder pads are worn on the shoulders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire shoulder protector is large, and the interior is supported by a special creature's bones into a V shape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole shoulder is dark gold with a lot of beautiful red, purple and white lines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shoulders are inserted from the head and fixed to the shoulders. The hem at the front and back is attached to the chest and back, symbolizing compassion and compassion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The towering sharp corners on both sides symbolize the piety and faith in the goddess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The golden cufflinks are fastened, and Su Ge sighs: "This shoulder is really heavy, and there is no practicality other than good looks."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking up at yourself in the mirror, the skin is fair, the dark hair is combed, the beard is clean, and after the nose hair has been trimmed, turn around and go out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This set of clothes is his fixed dress for a month. These days he wears a bishop’s robe every day, following Emilia’s constant running in the capital to appease the people. Declare teachings, help the weak, and ruling crimes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the course of action, it gradually expressed its existence and its status. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The bishop is an adult, may the goddess be with you." Going out of the door, just seeing the two guards coming over, respectfully said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly, and his mouth showed a sly smile and did not speak, missed it directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A month of study, he has found some rhythms and squats as a superior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bishop Sotos, early!" At the door of Emilia, Sug saw the Bishop of Kirien wearing the same clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Early, Bishop Kirien." Two people said, while saluting, pay tribute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ki’an looked at Su Ge’s appearance and said with a smile: “If you look at it, you have not lived up to the teachings of the Archbishop.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge has a humble answer: "This opportunity may only be one time in a lifetime. If you miss it, you will regret it for life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Bishop Kirian nodded with satisfaction: "Today we are going to leave the city of Bain with the Archbishop, you have to carry on the business here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Su Ge with a strong sense of self-confidence, stood up and said: "will not live up to the expectations of the Archbishop."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the bedroom door was opened, still wearing the pale pink robes, and the hooded Emilia came out with the strong female guard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two gave a slight salute, Emilia nodded: "Go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that, the group walked out of the palace along the corridor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the ruins of the ruins, Vanas led the mil, Elena, Marquis of Raul and many other ministers have already waited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for the help of the Archbishop for a month." Vanas wore a light blue, tight-fitting body, a wrinkled skirt with a loose hem and a thin coat on the outside. The yarn coat is full of elegance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emilia deeply looked at Vanas’s proud chest, didn’t know if she was licking her perfect figure, or care about her sarcoma in her chest. , soft smile: "May the goddess be with you, Her Majesty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "May the goddess be with you, Archbishop." Vanas's body The hands were on the forehead and the ceremony said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the two bid farewell, Emilia turned to look at Su Ge: "The foundation and base of the Cathedral of the Holy Blood have been processed, and the next The work will be handed over to you. The rats in the last four weeks are very restless and need to be cleaned up if necessary."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understand, Archbishop." Su Ge said respectfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emilia stretched out her finger and gently clicked on Su Ge’s forehead: "The servant of the goddess, bring hope to the believers!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s mouth reveals a deep smile: “You can rest assured that bringing hope to believers is one of my important missions.”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other side of Vanas also laughed, the look is more respectful, sincere, to whom respectful, to whom to be sincere, naturally needless to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the two sides were officially separated, and Emilia’s core and personnel returned to Bain City by plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining hundreds of members of the Church of the Holy Blood continue to help Su Ge complete the assembly and construction of the remaining Holy Blood Cathedral under the leadership of two bishops. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watching the aircraft disappear into the sky, everyone in the room suddenly breathed a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This time is really hard to die for me." Elena said without hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mir calmly said: "This Emilia is not simple, you have to be careful, you are likely to leave behind in other places." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas turned and asked: "What do you think? Bishop Su Ge?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now The true relationship remains undisclosed, and the two are equal to each other in front of these people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the eyes of everyone, with the advancement of the relationship, Vanas also began to call the name of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s mouth with a calm smile: “Reassured, everything is in my hands.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the time, the loss of the Emilia, the mountain-pressed people, the daily life is much easier, reducing a lot of cumbersome and unnecessary etiquette. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the most important thing is that everyone is their own, and they can do things and talk. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the palace, it is even possible to see the soldiers of the werewolf form training hard under the control of the sergeant and adapt to the powerful power of the werewolf form. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time after Su Ge did not live in the palace, but came to the construction site. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The large foundation has been built, and the specially treated black clay has strong hardness and impact resistance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The overall planning has been completed, and the rest is the wall assembly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since it is the future of his own nest, Su Ge naturally has a very good understanding of the whole process. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining two months, he personally, with two bishops running in various places on the site, supervising all the things they can see, such as the wall Thickness, angle, brick size standard, overall map layout, etc. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
