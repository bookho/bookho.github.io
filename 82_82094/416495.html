			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Evan was sent back, Sug sat there for a while, just in time to meet Evan’s parents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Betty did not say the curse, but said that Su Ge helped solve the problem of the school. This makes the old man ecstatic, and entertained the "scorpion" who is already in the high position in the most enthusiastic way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having dinner, everyone sat together and chatted happily, making Su Ge a little embarrassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember that when he was a child, both families were like this. In a warm living room, parents on both sides talked about adults. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Su Ge and Evan are hiding together and playing with toys. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Time is blinking, things are already wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At seven o'clock in the evening, with some remembrance and 惆怅Sug, bid farewell to the Evan family and return to the Church of the Holy Blood along the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seven o'clock in the north of October is completely dark, bright streetlights illuminate the dim streets, and the lights on the houses on both sides are full of peace and harmony. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the quiet road, Su Ge suddenly remembered himself a year ago, and... Ada. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know how she is doing now." Su Ge's feelings for Ada are very complicated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She did use herself, but for two years living together, she did take care of herself from the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her kindness and generosity are not false, but... too distorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sage...the mysterious profession of great achievements. From the temperament, she is the saint who is sacred in front of people, and the temperament makes people unable to produce any disrespect. Heart."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;叮叮叮...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contemplation, I heard a crisp moment in my ear Ringtones, smelling, and seeing three night robes wearing big robes and big hats, staring at themselves in the shadow of the corner, with a strong warning in their demeanor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it like a bad guy?" Su Ge sighed helplessly and waved at the three people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishop's portrait of the Church of the Holy Blood is not circulated internally. The new clergy here do not know Su Ge, the foreign bishop, but can feel it. Su Ge's mysterious temperament and elegant posture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three night patrols saw Sug’s beckoning to himself, and he did not come over and still looked cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is too lazy to explain, follow the road all the way back to the Cathedral of the Holy Blood, when watching the guards respect the salute, the three suddenly looked Wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After waiting for Su Ge to leave, the three night patrols rushed forward to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result is that the three are very embarrassed...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the suite, the bathing Sue The grid suddenly felt inductive, and then fell into the water and fell asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the kingdom of God, the door of the temple slowly opened a gap, and Su Ge, wearing a black robe, came out calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the temple, Su Ge saw Adeline, who had not seen for a long time, with Bonnie respectfully kneeling on the ground and saluting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly to indicate that two people stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adeline looked up at the current Su Ge and said with a smile: "The Pope’s growth in the past six months is really huge!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"People always want to grow up." Su Ge smiled and turned to look at the jewels that have been completely renewed, and smiled: " It seems that I am not growing up myself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benedicts replied earnestly: "This is the gift of the Lord to me, and I am born again." Opportunity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the simple greeting, Su Ge asked: "What is the matter when I take the initiative to return to the Kingdom of God?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suge’s focus has been on the Guinness side for more than half a year, and Adelin’s situation is passed and reported by the Cavaliers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the last Bain City incident, Su Ge has not met with Adeline. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adeline said with a serious face and said: "Bennis is not in a good state recently, always hears some indescribable whispers." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg heard this heartbeat and turned to look at Bernice: "What is the specific situation, talk about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bennis first lifted the skirt slightly and leaned forward and said: "In the last two weeks or so, I occasionally heard some weird sounds in my ear. That voice me I don't understand, it seems to come suddenly from my far away in my ear. There is also a lot of dreams and dreams of twisting unspeakable monsters and scenes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Su Ge silenced and asked: "Is it a foggy ancient city scene?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;British brows locked in silence, then shook his head: "No, the scene seems to be a world full of cluttered thoughts, where you can't think and can't remember."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adeline Exploring the question: "The Pope, you have already known the situation of the witch recently?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded: "Well, I handled it yesterday. The incident of the witch's runaway. The witch did not receive any stimulation, and she violently walked away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adeline heard this a little surprised because she found Su Ge I am already growing to the height of myself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I estimate that this matter should be related to the ancient demons in the maze of blood," Su Ge said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adeline heard what happened to Gerlos before he said to himself, and asked: "For the Holy Blood Maze and the Witch, you know from the church." How much?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge briefly said what he heard at Emilia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adeline nodded and said, "She only said half."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are other Hidden?" Su Ge brows a pick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adeline took a deep breath and said, "Remember the situation of the witch who told you about Gerlos before you told me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, there is such a It’s going on.” Su Ge recalled the letter from Gerlos and nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He entrusted me with the truth," Adelline said earnestly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugarton came to the interest: "Say!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adeline tidy up the thoughts Su Ge knows to go down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is one thing you need to know first. The ancient demon that Emilia said is the ancient god in the church. The ancient inscription on the church coat of arms." The blood of God is actually extracted from the body of the ancient gods of the Holy Blood Maze, the birthplace of the Holy Blood, the source of the name of the Holy Blood Maze."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Su Ge’s heart was shocked, but his expression calmly asked: “That is, the core secret of the church, the source of blood therapy is actually the blood of the ancient gods?”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adeline nodded: "Yes, although the March church is a goddess of March, it is not the gift of the goddess of March that really made them a family, but the maze in the dungeon. The bodies of the ancient gods. After discovering the maze of the dungeon, they controlled the immortal and majestic body of the maze in some way. Through years of experimentation, a huge amount of knowledge was excavated from that body. The most core blood treatment is the input of ancient gods The by-product produced by the blood. The potion is a special agent that appears on the basis of blood therapy. According to the information that Jerousus tells me through some methods, all the demon hunters in the church will be transferred to the maze of blood. Conducting horrible training and memory blockade. But Jellos is special. He inadvertently awakens those memories in order to bring the truth out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge has no Speaking, bowing and sinking quickly digested a lot of knowledge and horrifying truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Five minutes later, Suge gestured: "Continue."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adeline Deep Take a breath and continue to explain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The birth of the witch, Emilia is not wrong. It is true that the parasites of the ancient gods caused the variation of those women and gave them special abilities. No one knows exactly what the principle is. But in the years of research, the Church of the Holy Blood found that the sarcoma of the witch can resonate with the body of the ancient god, and whenever they send a witch back to the maze of blood, into the ancient god When you are in the body, the ancient gods will give back a lot of knowledge, that is, this knowledge will make the Church of the Holy Blood rise rapidly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait, what you mean is integration... What do you mean?" Su Ge asked questions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aideline’s face is dignified: “The body of the god is already dead, although it can be seen directly, but it has a very strange power. For many years The Church of the Holy Blood only developed a little knowledge from the blood of the ancient gods, because the things of high horror are beyond human understanding."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, it is fed to the ancient gods. Although the body is dead, but the activity is still, not only can breathe, but even eat. That is, those witches are actually the food left by the ancient gods! After all, in occult, heart Kindness, the pure soul of the girl is the supreme mysterious medium. This is why those parasites choose the kind of parasitic girl."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this Su Ge Still calm, but the shimmering dark eyes represent his inner fluctuations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adeline added: "As for Emilia, she is very good. She is different from those who are distorted. She is a true devout. She It is estimated that this is not to lie to you, maybe the church told her this way. After all, she is not as old as this year, and the responsibility of the central archbishop is mainly on the side of politics and rule, and there is not much to know about their authority on the mysterious side. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speaking of this, Aideline tempted the suggestion: "If you can, you can even join her to our church."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly: "I have considered this for a long time. Now I know the attitude and nature of the church for the witch."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is another important thing. The church will hold a secret witch hunting action every few years in exchange for more knowledge and power. Gerlos said that the next witch There is still a year of hunting. If you plan to shelter the witch, please do it in advance. ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge calmly nodded: "I will find a way to do this. After hearing these news, I have some ideas and ideas in my mind. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Adeline asked: "The Pope, His Majesty said that if my Lord can lower the power and restore his emotions, he can Join the church of the late bell and offer my most devout faith and everything for the rest of my life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
