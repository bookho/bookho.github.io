			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Practice makes perfect... Su Ge’s heart is watching some admiration in his thick palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a real deaf person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the silence, walked through the small square, two people came to a rare straight stone road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the left side of the two, there is a lot of faint light, and some shouts can be heard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge turned and asked: "When you came here, did you see this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The butcher shook his head in silence and squeezed the serrated machete to go over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire is not far from two people, it is about a hundred meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a bridge hole about 20 meters long in the middle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outside of the bridge seems to extend to another slightly larger square. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At that time, the square was full of fire, and the flaming flame reflected the surrounding scenery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fire, the two blurredly saw some dancing, jumping shadows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It looks like there are more than a dozen people holding all kinds of weapons in their hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two looked at each other and walked carefully along the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But just as two people walked into the bridge hole, just halfway through, Su Ge suddenly felt something wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Run!" Su Ge sighed and rushed forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, it’s still late, with a chain of harsh friction, the front and rear exits of the bridge are directly closed by two steel gates. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of gate Su Ge has seen that the steel fence with the arm thickness and the large iron gate on the square belong to the same model. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sharp spear tip pierces the ground, and the weight of a few thousand pounds is like the ground, just like growing on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge slowly stopped and did not act rashly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butcher squeezed the sawtooth chopper and stood beside the gate looking out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"嘎嘎嘎!嘎嘎嘎!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A hoarse voice came, Su Ge The fire was found to be getting closer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that, five or six figures appeared in front of the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people wore dilapidated clothes, holding a rusted machete in one hand and a hot torch in one hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are some with retro round top hats, some wearing classic vests, and wearing bloody leather jackets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are all male, blindfolded with a linen belt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people are very dirty, the whole skin is full of blood and mud, and at the same time, on the face, or on the hands, or the neck is dark. Long hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire illuminates the dark, damp paths around them, while illuminating the eyes they are covered by the burlap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the gap in the linen, Su Ge can see that there are no pupils in their eyes, full of gray and turbid like muddy water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they seem to be able to see two people, looking at the two people with the hunter looking at the prey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader holds a heavy long-handed axe in his hand, and the metal axe blade rests on the ground, giving a harsh rubbing sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"%¥%#%......" These people are not completely mad, and the person who took the lead said something that two people could not understand at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge’s face ugly said: "You should listen to it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butcher silenced the handle: "Well, it is ancient Byron Diaz Language."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ancient Byronian language is the language used by the ancient dynasty of Byron, tens of thousands of years old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The language of that era is still the initial stage of the language, so many pronunciations are not standard, and the tongue is like a big tongue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This feeling cannot be described, but when you hear it, you know that this is the unique language of that dynasty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the period of the Soviet Union, he learned a lot of languages ​​and even learned the language of ancient Byron Dias because he had to study philosophy-related theories. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he wouldn’t say it, he couldn’t understand it, but he could hear it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This language has been extinct for many years, even if it was not used in the original ancient city." Su Ge said ugly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butcher’s nose moved and said: “The blood, the rust, is full of years of taste.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"The taste of the years? How did you smell it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With the spirit to strengthen the nose, master-level intensification can make the nose smell a lot Other smells."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Intensive surgery can also be used like this?" Su Ge was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Su Ge’s current attention is not too tangled on this, because those people have already come to the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"%@¥%##%%" The head of the axe man finished, the other people behind him suddenly smiled and walked over to put the torch Stretching in, shaking in front of the two, it seems that people are teasing two monkeys in cages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, the two people faintly heard some screams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of such actions, both of them are very calm, Su Ge has already thought of something at this time, whispered: "The porcelain of the gods, this language and the era, and this architectural style, the city..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butcher’s face is a little dignified: “This city is probably the capital of the Byron empire that disappeared with the Holy Grail because of the Holy Grail of the Soul!” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the former site and ruins of the Byron Empire, it was identified and excavated many years ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In one of the underground palaces there, the Byron Secret was dug up and let people glimpse the ancient great empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in many years of archaeological discoveries, people have discovered a very strange problem, that is, no one finds the capital of the empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the record, the capital of the Byron Empire was built in the middle of a continuous mountain range, a majestic and magnificent city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nearly 100,000 people lived in the city at the time, which is the center of the human world in the true sense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, even if you encounter a disaster of terror, you should leave some old sites and traces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the city disappeared, no one knows where the city is going. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at these mad people, Su Ge whispered: "The legendary capital of Byron Dias has actually sunk into the abyss." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who can think of it." The butcher also felt shocked and whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside, these people seem to be very dissatisfied with the reaction of Su Ge, and they yelled in the mouth, then bent down and picked up a few The jar was thrown in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge snorted and raised his foot and slammed on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, with Su Ge as the starting point, the ground was passed to the crowd with a violent shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The violent vibration made these people squat, the hand slipped, and the jar in his hand fell to the ground and broke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large black oil spread slowly on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug's finger picks a little, and a sharp sound blade directly cuts off a person's torch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the falling of the torch, there was a fierce flame burning by the iron gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person standing in the middle of these oils was suddenly burned by the flames, and there was a terrible scream in his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scream suddenly caused more movement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, more residents in the distance ran wildly here, and there were more than a dozen wolves with no skins and incomprehensible appearances. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butcher tightened the weapon and rushed up, but was stopped by Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"See clearly." Su Ge said solemnly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butcher looked carefully and saw the inhabitants who were burning with flames. Although they were so horribly miserable, they would see that the flame was not hurt. To them a trace of fur. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment they have become a fireman, seemingly suffering great pain, but without any harm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After tens of thousands of years, they have long since departed from the human form and entered a new form. I estimate that there is no way to kill them by conventional means. It is very dangerous for so many people to fight rashly. First retreat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butcher nodded after listening and turned away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When two people turned their heads, they found that there was still a dark gate behind them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug quickly stepped forward, the cane in his hand directly into a long sword form, with the strength of the whole body slammed against the top. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A clear sound, Su Geton felt his arm numb with shock, and the stick almost did not fly out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this steel!?" Suger was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although his body is not strong, the weapon in his hand is a change from the weapon of the king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the way, this sword can be said to be invincible and cut iron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, there is no trace left on this iron pillar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butcher glanced at the sword in the hands of Su Ge and praised: "It’s a good sword."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;This suddenly made Sugg a little embarrassed: "Can you cut it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butcher nodded slightly, pinching the old chopper in his hand, the pace is like a The moving mountains are as slow as forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge standing on the side clearly felt that the butcher at this time was connected to the whole earth, he became the thick and solid land, giving one Unspeakable and sturdy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the field of vision, Sug saw that the muscles on his arm were moving slowly, and then there was a burst of diamond-like radiance in the pores. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, his arm is like a diamond arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咔咔咔...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, the bite of the gear rang and Sug turned Look and find that those residents are opening the door and preparing to rush in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗷呜呜...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door has just been lifted less than half a meter away, those crazy The skinless dog rushed in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug raises his hand and several sound waves are directly launched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the accident that caused him to appear appeared. His sound wave blade was applied to these dogs, and there was no effect at all. Even a dent did not stay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the dog is very fast, when Suge is surprised, the three dogs have already rushed to the position of Su Ge less than one meter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mouth full of saliva and fangs suddenly opened and biting into Sug. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sly teeth are bitten and that is a large piece of meat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the crucial moment, the long hair of the whole body of Erha floated, and a large suffocation was suddenly spurted in his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just like the previous bone ooze, these three dogs were frozen in midair, and then fell and fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug had just breathed a sigh of relief, but he was surprised to find that the dog was frozen and shattered. At this time, it slowly squirmed on the ground and gradually gathered. , to self-heal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嘎嘎嘎! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time the front door was completely up, and the inhabitants of the body burning with flames rushed over with the mouths of other residents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hurry up!" The form of these people is too strange, and Su Ge has no confidence in dealing with them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the voice just fell, Suger heard a harsh cut. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slightly sideways, Su Ge first saw countless splashes of Mars, then saw the thick and worn serrated knife like cut tofu, instantly three adult arms The solid steel of the thickness was cut off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a second, the butcher said: "Go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, that link with the earth The body instantly turned into a light feather, and jumped out directly along the cut door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge followed him and jumped out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just jumped out, the back light of Sug's eyes saw a mirror-like cross section on the fence of the arm, and looked down at the sawtooth chopper that looked very dull in the butcher's hand. His face was very dignified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sawtooth chopper is a conventional weapon. If it is sharper than a cane, the gap between them is the gap between the wooden sword and the steel sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The solid steel of the arm thickness can be cut so neatly, obviously not how good the knife is, but the hand holding the knife, the person holding the knife! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the heart was shocked, there was a sudden burst of sorrow in the back of the two men. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge turned his head and looked at it, suddenly tightening his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the gap that has just been cut by the butcher does not know why, it has completely recovered, just like the scene that the butcher has just cut is an illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butcher ran and said: "The entire city, the residents of the city have been completely conceptualized."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Conceptual!" Su Ge's face is gloomy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called conceptualization is somewhat similar to regularization. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like the fact that the Institute of Polar and the death sect did in Guinness, the concept of the werewolf was planted in the country of Guinness, then the whole country People will gradually become beastrate because of the concept of this "werewolf country." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in this city, the concept of these people seems to be more thorough and powerful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They are intertwined with the abyss and become part of the legend itself." The butcher continued. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge suddenly remembered the legend about the three lost cities in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three lost cities are:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The capital of the Byron Empire: Byron City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
