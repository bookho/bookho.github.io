			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge naturally did not want to deliberately swear at him, smiled: "I can see the sincerity of the captain, since you do not know how to open, then still The same, I first told the captain a message, then the captain gave me the same amount according to the importance of this news, how?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mur has some helplessness in his heart Sighed, he knew that, like last time, the initiative was robbed by Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although helpless, Moore had to accept it silently and said: "You please say."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "This incident has the shadow of a city of disaster." Su Ge said clearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;! ! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moore’s eyes are obviously getting bigger and the pupils are gradually shrinking to show the shock of this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not a small thing, are you sure?" Silence for ten seconds, Moore looked very serious and solemnly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge calmly said: "My people found some black blood on the other side. There are many creatures with black blood on the mainland, but none of them. Planted near the misty mountains, not to mention, there seems to be only one unknown blood that can be emitted from the blood."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moore heard the squats on his legs, hands Hold your hands and hold your head and fall into meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you not the opposite of the city of disaster? Should you know these guys very well? Shouldn’t you be nervous like this?" Su Ge saw that he was surprised. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moore’s face with a bitter smile: “I don’t know who is fearless, just because I know too much, I know the horror of the guys.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it convenient to disclose it?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moore asks: "Can you offset this information?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It depends on what you give The information is out. If it is comprehensive enough, I can tell you something else," Sug said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calling Moore, his purpose is to gain a deep understanding of the city of disaster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moore’s silence after hearing it seems to be in a struggle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have to tell me that if you can make me a little prepared, we can join hands to face the city of disasters and join hands."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moore listened and looked up at Su Ge, just to see that Su Ge had a confident face and said with pride: "The other dare not say, now on combat effectiveness, I am Very confident."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moore was silent for a few seconds, his voice was hoarse, and he said with struggle: "I want to know the details of this ancient city, you Exclusive in his hand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Complete." Su Ge laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mur spit out a sigh of relief and thought about it: "The following situations are high-level secrets of our law enforcers, even if Selena doesn't know this, is The core information we have, I hope that you don't rush out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am not the kind of person who has two sides and three knives, betrayed, you should know some." Su Ge said calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moore nodded, the mysterious person’s heart is very important, and the more dark and distorted the heart, the more likely it is to go wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And those who are open-minded and miss you are much safer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He believes that Su Ge, a promising person, will not violate his heart and deceive himself in such matters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he opened his mouth and the first sentence uttered an explosive content: "The master behind the hunter is a great god."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Su Ge’s face is also dignified: “Do you still have a living god?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moore shook his head and explained: "The great gods live indifferent to life. The existence of being able to enter this field is itself an immortal existence. Only they will gradually fall into madness by giving up their form."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But there are also some great gods who will find their own body when they are going crazy, and complete the birth. The city of the disaster is estimated to be the great god who has been born."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up at Su Ge, and some strange red blood appeared in his eyes: "We call him...the eyes...the god..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These four words are very difficult to say, it seems that he is suffering a lot of pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blood eyes, red complexion, panting after the end, like a dying person who was almost pinched to death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Eye..." Just opened, Su Ge felt an invisible force blocking himself, and seemed to be warning himself not to say these four words Go out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Sug was ready to say the second word, he felt the invisible force began to squeeze his temples, and his eyes began to feel hot and swollen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he immediately shuts up and calms down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gradually, that power disappears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Su Ge opened his eyes again, he smiled bitterly: "I didn't expect these four words to have such a huge binding force."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moore took a silver jug ​​and took a sip: "He is different from Guinness's great god of death. The great god of death has been dissipated for a long time, and his will is estimated. Decomposed into the most primitive pieces of thought, its power is not even practical, and it becomes part of the rule itself. But He is different, He has the consciousness of self, and has the form of self. He can add some words for certain words through the mysterious network. Restrictions to ensure their own security and mystery."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge nodded, it was like his last generation on the Internet. If some big sisters don't want some names to appear, they will be harmonious and become an asterisk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the same reason, the one who does not want people to name his name, so imposes some restrictions on these four words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, this limit is not the strongest, and the strongest will happen in two cases. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One is that the person who said it died directly, and the other is that it can’t be said at all, just like the restriction of the system of vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This one is related to the eyes?" Su Ge asked. Moore nodded: "The Great God is the embodiment of the rule, and it can be turned into rules and hidden in the rules. It is very tricky and makes us fear." "Things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because, can He hide in anyone's eyes, or in sight?" Su Ge suddenly thought of a horror that made him feel Thoughts. Moore smiled and nodded: "Almost, the direction is right. Although he can't enter the material world due to certain restrictions,..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, his face is bitter: "Even if it is a trace of breath, it will instantly cause more than a dozen, even dozens of law enforcers out of control. Past history In the past, this kind of example has appeared many times."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It has clearly achieved an absolute advantage, and it is clear that it has already won the game, and obviously has made sufficient preparations. It paid a sufficient price. However, inadvertent four-eye intersection will result in the destruction of a whole law enforcement squad and even the brigade."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Direct death still Well, if you become a monster because you are out of control, that is the most painful time for us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hands friends, even teachers, relatives, this It’s a tough choice for anyone, even if you know that he’s crazy. Already dead. But see the familiar face of the past..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moore pinches his fist and says: "This kind of thing is only qualified for talents above the captain level. I know, otherwise the situation is too desperate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is silent, and I don’t know what to say for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He couldn’t understand the feeling of being tense at the moment, nor could he know the struggles of his loved ones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he knows that the feeling is really heartbreaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I killed a total of three former comrades, as well as my sister." Moore's voice was extremely low. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere in the carriage was very dignified, and even Lobo, who was on the sidelines, felt uncomfortable, licking his nose and looking out the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Amount, sorry! I have complained so much about you." After a while, Moore reacted and apologized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge swings his hand: "I can speak it out, I am very good at listening. Of course, the story of less tragedy is the best, haha."<br <<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mur Chang Shu breathed out: "This has been in my heart for a long time. Today, I really feel a lot easier, thank you again for listening." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Continue the topic just now," said Su Ge. Moore nodded. "Beyond the threat of that one, the hunters themselves are very tricky. Their lowest three-eye hunters are expert, as the most common." The lower-level arms. According to the information available, the six-eye hunter is now the strongest, and the strength is the dominator. The original church and the archbishop of the church in March, he personally led the team." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The hunters will not speak, but they can communicate with each other through special psionic abilities. The wisdom of the four-eyed hunter is similar to that of normal humans, while the six-eyed hunter The wisdom is even far beyond humans, and it has entered a whole new field."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The weapons they use are very diverse, including melee weapons, firearms, ropes, and even Poison, hidden weapon. The only good news is that only four eye hunters and the above hunters will use some spells, ordinary hunters will not use them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"General five Individual as a group of actions, by a four-eyed hunter Leading the team, the rest are three-eyed hunters."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They have a very good understanding of each other, there is almost no mistake. They have everyone A prey, a bloody bag. The bag is specially treated, and the human being loaded will seal all psionic energy and become ordinary people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
