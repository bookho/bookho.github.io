			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dark underground palace, the air is cold and damp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The walls of the surrounding walls are covered with moss and mushrooms, and the ticking of the slowly falling water drops gives a heavy sense of oppression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s full of cobweb corners, a full-footed, spider-sized spider is feeding on the body of a mouse, in the gap of the corner, the big black cockroach is Snake confrontation...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark open space is like an abandoned independent world, full of sin and evil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mess of footsteps came from the corridor not far away, the dim light reflected on the wall, and countless bugs rushed into the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the fire, the blur sees the moss and the mushroom under the wall has a large number of patterns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These patterns have a long history and are vague, like the inscriptions on the ancient stone tablets, and the baptism of the years is full of desolateness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the years have passed, it is still ambiguous to see that the above is a distorted, indescribable monster. The shape of the behemoth is indescribable, even impossible to understand by human thinking. It is beyond all science, common sense with biology, and even the mystery and mythology cannot explain the distorted body structure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just like this huge existence is a heterogeneity of the whole world, or the most primitive source of the whole world, an aggregate of chaos and contradiction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire is getting closer and closer, and a group of people wearing a light blue robe with a pointed hood and a face hidden under the hat came over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are about fifty people in these groups, and in front are four guards with torches and armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; behind the guard is a middle-aged man in a dark red robe with a crown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the left behind him is a stupid old man, on the right is a full-fledged lady. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind these people are a total of thirty maids in black robes, each of whom has a baby in their arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Behind the maid are twenty guards armed with long rifles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pedestrian walked out of the corridor and came to this strange underground palace. No one spoke, and the gloomy atmosphere of the people could not breathe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surrounding guards lit the torches into the grooves on the surrounding walls, and the entire dark underground palace was completely illuminated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the fire, spiders, cockroaches, and snakes were frightened and quickly hid and disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire underground palace is large, about 30 meters in diameter, almost ten meters high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surrounding area is made of stone bricks. There are hollow ditches on the ground like the array method. There are many small hollows in the middle. I don’t know what to do. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are seven large columns supported by the roof, and the roof is elliptical hemisphere, with seven hot suns on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the innermost side of the underground palace, there is a dusty altar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The altar is simple in appearance, and the brickwork in the base is somewhat broken and very worn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially before the altar, the three scorpions were deeply scratched, as if the claws of a huge monster were swept away here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The left side of the altar is a statue of a woman who is kneeling and curling up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this statue is very strange, because the woman’s head has completely exploded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the whole statue looks like a woman’s head bursting out. The sculpture of the statue is incomparably real, just like a real person, lifelike. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brain can be splashed in the head, the skull bursting, the eyeball that is about to fly out of the eye, and the twisted cheek. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in the brain that is about to splatter, I can see a strange little hand and some tiny tentacles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statue on the right is a headless woman who bends down and stretches out her hand as if to pick up something, it looks normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along with the closeness of the crowd, a large number of bugs climbed out of the groove at the beginning of the woman's explosion and ran to other places to see people very embarrassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the altar, there is a huge twisted skull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This skull has five large, normal skulls, and the gray-black skull is full of cracks. There are six mouth-shaped holes in front of the eyes, and the mouth is high and convex. It is like the mouth of a beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The skull seems to have not completely rotted, and there are still a small amount of hair on the top of the cracked head. It is very uncomfortable to see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inside of the skull is completely empty, but the strange thing is that no worm enters the skull, or from the accumulation of a large number of worms on the side, no worm can Enter this skull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking up and looking at the statue on the right, the woman’s hands are sticking out in the direction that seems to be ready to pick up this huge and strange skull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your Majesty, already ready." The old man and the middle-aged man came to the altar and made a weak and weak voice, talking to the middle-aged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man nodded slightly and turned to look behind him and said, "Prepare, my people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;?;&nbsp; Hearing, the maid's eyes gradually widened, his mouth opened to reveal the white teeth, the face of the fanaticism, looks like a group of people eating crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These maids slowly dispersed, and they stood along three ditches leading to the altar, each with a small hole in front of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the ground, they took a silver-gray spike about one meter long from their arms and inserted the base into the tiny hole, sharp. The peak is up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Great ancient gods, our ancestors, our source, please accept our sacrifices now, so wake up!" The thin old man said with open arms and suddenly picked up a knife and pierced his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that, he actually dug his heart and pinched it in his hand, and squeezed out the blood from the skull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The skull that was topped with blood, as if it were alive, quickly absorbed the blood above, and the six eyes flashed with strange gray light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart's blood is squeezed out, the old man's body is weak on the ground, his head is low, and he is dead in a pool of blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man carrying the lady stepped forward and walked over to the weird skull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"%#%¥#¥" For a time, there was a whisper in the entire palace, which seemed to speak some ancient languages. , low, strange, people are a bit distorted after listening to the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound is getting louder and louder, and the twenty guards around him suddenly took out their rifles and pierced their chests, accompanied by a lot of blood spurting, and the expression changed. Hey, open his mouth and swear words that he can't understand at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maids of the maids on the side are falling out of their eyes, revealing the mouth of Senbai’s teeth constantly closing and whispering the strange language, while the hands are lifted and slammed down. Actually, the baby's body in his hand was stabbed in the spike on the front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, the spike pierced the skull of all the babies, and the corpse was hung there, extremely cruel, bloody, scalp numb, shuddering . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The massive blood began to collect through the three ditches and flowed to the altar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the altar, the middle-aged and the lady, after confirming the situation, stepped forward and reached out and touched the skull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咕咕噜吧唧......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, a strange voice that could not be described instantly resounded throughout The underground palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
