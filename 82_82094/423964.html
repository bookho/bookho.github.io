He said, "I don't know your identity yet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s thoughts: "Do not fall to the fortress and the churches." There is information, and there is still an opportunity to cooperate in the future. There is no need to hide it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After finishing, Su Ge bluntly said: "Sug Sotos. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing these two people is a glimpse, then Moore accidentally said: "Now the regional bishop of Guinness!?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How? Isn't it like?" Su Ge raised his legs and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moore once again carefully looked at Su Ge and sighed: "You are much younger than I thought."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The side of Serena heard the constant swaying of her eyes, and the expressionless face resisted the shock and embarrassment of the skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She called Su Ge a cancer, thinking that Su Ge was the initiator of these two incidents, or an accomplice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can hear the name, she immediately knows, Su Ge is the savior of these two events. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moore here again apologizes: "I am sorry, Bishop Sotos, just really misunderstood."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Su Ge puts his hand on his hand: "I don't want to talk about it, just say something right. Now the new bishop is a newbie, and Archbishop Emilia will temporarily call me back to deal with this mysterious gathering, and the witch. Let's talk about the situation!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moore looked at Serena’s face and sorted out her own thoughts: “The cause of the incident is about A special mysterious wave half a month ago. You should know that the mystery of the whole world is like a spider web, moving one place and moving all over. I was divined as a master astrologer, and the results showed the source of the whole thing. Located in the north. But this time the level of volatility is too high, I can only get this information."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about the other?" Su Ge asked quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selina coughed at this moment and explained: "After we investigated this volatility, we found that this volatility is widespread and affects many people. The specific impact is divided into two aspects. The first is that the witch is affected and runs out of control. The other is that some special people have been horrified by the infection. We have dealt with 18 human mutation killings, distribution In all parts of the world, both men and women, both young and old, have become very strange and horrible, and the whole body is mystified and has gained a strange power."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Grid analysis: "As a witch, then this group of mutants must have something in common. Have you conducted a post-mortem examination and a soul inquiry?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Selena nodded: "The corpus and the witch's sarcoma are similar and cannot be dissected. For this reason we sacrificed three outstanding lives, and the soul..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Their souls are already Disappeared, seems to be some kind of weird thing sucked. "Moore continued. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug continues to ask: "What else?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because the scope is too large, we It’s not yet possible to determine the commonality of these people, and there is only so much useful information,” Moore said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you doing here this time? And those mysterious people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Serena explained: "This time so many mysterious people gathered here mainly because of a five-level secret treasure."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The sacrifice of blood?" Gemei picked one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know!?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge glanced at the two and asked faintly: "Do you have any misunderstandings about the bishop of the Holy Blood Church?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No! No! Don't get me wrong!" Two people hurriedly waved their hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge integrated the information he just knew and asked: "Is there someone outside the north saying that someone has sent someone?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fake, the hearsay is passed on by people." Serena had a hint of disdain in her mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about this Su Ge calmly said: "Your intelligence is not of great value."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The two looked at each other and were awkward. They also know the degree of the ribs of this information, so they put the gesture relatively low. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug continued: "Ginnis over there, the root cause of the disaster is the new high-level Yi, the moon beast, summoned by the Death Sect and the Institute of Polar Studies. There are also new Yi people, human face rats."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two heard this and immediately wrote down, Moore still asked: "There are two kinds of attributes of the Yi ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Take other information to change." Su Ge said straightforwardly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two listened to meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is casual, but with a hint of temptation: "I have a lot of intelligence that you will be interested in, believe me. In order to show my sincerity, I It can be said that two core keywords, life outside the field, and the great gods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard these two people jump. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others don’t know what these two words represent, and they can be very clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two kinds of existence, just come up with a horrible existence that shocked the whole world, a little careless, a city, even a country is destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking up at the calm and calm, Su Ge, sitting there, Moore sighed: "The Church of the Holy Blood really is a talented person, the name of the legendary bishop. It’s not white.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is Serena turned to look at Moore and ask what to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mur is a captain who has been a team for a few years. He simply asked for a moment. He asked: "Are you interested in Byron the Great?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Byron the Great!?" Su Ge flashed a glimmer of light in his eyes, said quietly: "Some interests, he should be the most legendary figure in the entire human history. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moore sighed with relief: "We just investigated and sorted out a set of exclusive information about Byron the Great."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Information is one-on-one, So which one do you want to know?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moore indulges: "The Great Son of God."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared to those outside the astral Things, he is more concerned about these local conditions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The problem is not big, but the value is to be estimated." Su Ge nodded slightly and agreed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moore sorted out his thoughts and explained carefully: "Byron is called the ancestor of the human race, and his legend can be traced back to 30,000 years ago. In the ruins of the ruins of the Dead Sea, it is recorded that Byron the Great is likely to be the first human being to contact the mysterious existence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh!?" Gee has an interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The ancient stone monument of the Sea of ​​Death portrays a relatively detailed situation, in which a human being has tried hard to come to a mountain and get a full The shining cup. The man holding the cup returned to spread the knowledge, ruled the humanity, and finally formed the first densely populated country in the entire human civilization: the Byron Empire. And this person holding a glorious cup It is the Byron Great!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge squinted: "Byron the Great holds the Holy Grail?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp "Yes, according to the history, there is more than one holy grail, it should be seven, which symbolizes the seven basic rules of the whole world, that is, the root of knowledge. The secrets of the cold church are recorded in the ancient times. During the Cold War Dynasty, the emperor of the dynasty had a cup that controlled extreme cold and blizzard, and it was probably the second holy grail."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge heard this fall into Contemplation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moore paused and smiled at Su Ge: "These information should have some value, Bishop Sotos."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is not a jealous person, nodded slightly: "The human face is a lower-level Yi, 25 points can see the size of the cat, the attack is not strong, the moon beast, need 56 points of vision, high-grade Yi creatures, with strong mechanical technology..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge said, Serena hurriedly took out the book and carefully wrote it down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Every moon beast has more than normal human intelligence and at least master-level combat power." Su Ge said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear this Moore with surprise: "This kind of high intelligence, the Yi people with technology, we still heard for the first time, even in historical records. Without such traces of the Yi people, this is really too important for us, Bishop Sotos."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug said with a smile: "The Yi people are the whole human race." The enemy, you and I are all of the same family. It is our mission to fight against the Yi people together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selina secretly grinned: "If this is the case, you will You should tell us for free."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moore said with a smile: "Yes, Bishop Sotos said very much."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So the captain, I also showed my sincerity, it is up to you." Su Ge said. Moore nodded and continued: "There were no Yi people in the world at that time. Human beings are the masters of this land. They have gained all kinds of extraordinary powers by relying on the Holy Grail." But soon, heresy happened."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know why, the Byron land holding the Holy Grail suddenly went crazy, and he seems to have integrated into the Holy Grail. Among them, the power of the Holy Grail created a horrible and distorted dream that enveloped the whole country. Most human beings became horrible monsters. The whole country fell into frenziedness and destruction. The mad Byronian emperor melted in the Holy Grail. It disappeared, and the first empire of human civilization died overnight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After?"<br /><br />&nbsp; Moore shook his head: "The history of the past is completely cut off. The continuous history that humans can now examine is only about eight thousand years since the first dynasty. The Byronian dynasty is at least 30,000. The interval between years, the middle age occurred Nothing can be considered so far."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But according to vague records, in that disaster, one of the sons of Byron the Great was unknown. The shelter survived, and the content of the murals was too long to be seen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
