In the camp, Sapir's face was gloomy and very angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hola's face is also very bad, and the haze says: "This thing must be checked."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Moore looked at these two pretending things, and he was sneer in his heart, but he said calmly: "The problem now is not to go deep into these things, but to stabilize the whole situation. According to the sentinel report, At least 300 mysterious people have entered the foggy mountains in the early hours of the morning. Now, it is not clear where they are going into the city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These people rushed into the city If it causes any problems, it will inevitably affect our previous deployment, and the entire city must be completely blocked!" Sapir said with a serious look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s heart snorted: “Previous deployment? I don’t remember if we had a deployment before.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Horace followed and asked: "What are the plans of Bishop Sapir?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sapir cleared the scorpion: "We should take the whole city Blocked, it is not allowed to enter at will. Of course, we can't stop the explorers who want to hunt for treasure."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stop, he looked around: "So, We should first hold the city, then we will compile all mysterious people, put them into our ranks, and explore with us in the city. People are more powerful, and each other can be considered as each other."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"哼!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Moore, Bells, and Su Ge are both sneer in the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They know the two small abacus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The question now is, with our current staff, can we control these people, these people are already imminent," Bells said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having heard this, the two bishops seem to have already had plans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sapir said: "We don't need to stop, stop it, stop it, let them go in, we just have to hold the door, don't let them come out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear This, Moore's face is gloomy: "Sapire Bishop, you are a murder!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am for the stability of the mysterious world!" Sapir seriously The answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heras followed and said: "Captain Moore, please think about it. If these secret treasures are really scattered all over the unorganized and undisciplined mystery In the hands, what about the mysterious world, you should be very clear as a law enforcer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moore listened to silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The killing of treasures has existed since ancient times, and the mysterious world is even more crazy, not just treasures, even for some precious materials, even a ridicule Harmony, it is possible to hit a big fight, even cursing, cursing and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mystery of itself is another world that exists outside the rule of law. In the past, the mysterious people themselves were weak, and law enforcement officials could also make rules through hard power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If such a large number of secret treasures are scattered, the strength of the overall folk mystery is bound to increase greatly, and not to mention the threat to the mysterious, those who hold the secret treasure The mystery itself is a custom bomb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not everyone who jumps out of the rules of law has good self-discipline. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wicked, there are many people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain!" Sapir looked at Moore seriously: "How many good people are there in the mysterious world, how many madmen are you knowing much better than us, and dare to come here to win Bao, who kills his companions to get the secret treasure, and several of them are normal people? Let these murderers be released, let those who suddenly gain great power harm the mysterious world?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moore is not talking, this is very reasonable, and cuts the key to Moore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if he is instinctively agreeing, he is not a law enforcer, but he is an ordinary resident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Letting this group of madmen rush out, it is like sending thousands of guns to a group of murderers in a country completely banned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These people are a huge threat to both the public and the law enforcers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After five minutes, Moore said: "Well, organize the personnel immediately and block the ancient city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp After getting the promise of Moore, the entire coalition began to operate at a horrible speed, and a command was issued. Everyone was like a gear in a clock, and it was well-ordered and precisely operated. The coalition’s horror monsters are working. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, they still underestimated the madness and quantity of those mysterious people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the ancient law did not blame the public, when the mysterious man went up the mountain, because of some contradictions, a female swordsman mystery suddenly killed the clerics of the shining church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this, like Mars falling into gasoline, instantly ignited the mystery and luck of many mysterious people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the chaos began. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mysterious people who rushed over had more than 300 people, and many of the coalition forces can now fight for 60 people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional to the other cult organization personnel who provoke the separation, originally expected a very good situation to instantly lose control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, ten clerics died in ten minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, just as the riots are about to get out of control, the people of the Church of the Holy Blood are here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; led by Laurie wearing a white archbishop robe, next to the bishop of the dark star. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people brought the elite troops of the 200 Holy Blood Church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the Holy Swords as the center, plus the sacred officer, the sinner, the demon hunter, the overall combat power is terrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This unit, the troublemakers do not know how they appeared, just like the appearance of the sky, the people will be surrounded in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several of the mysterious people who killed the red eye did not know how to turn around and attack the Holy Sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only see the members of the Holy Sword team wearing a silver-gray armor, reaching out and grasping the huge holy sword behind them, slamming on the hilt . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a burst of sound like an engine suddenly sounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second sword is like a weightless person who is pinched in his hand, slamming forward with lightning speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;噗嗤...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a burst of steam from the glyphs of the sword, The big sword fell down from the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the silent, the blood splatters, the whole body of the person is neatly split into two halves from the middle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the horrible holy sword is cut to the ground...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a low roar, the ground was pulled out of a pit with a diameter of one meter. The huge blade was neatly immersed in half the length of the ground, like a cut. The sharp edge in tofu is average. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咔咔咔...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the gear bite is transmitted through the hollowed sword It is faint to see that the sword is full of sophisticated gears and steel bars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the core technology of the Church of the Holy Blood: the Steam Blood Sword, referred to as the Holy Sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Swords team has a heart and soul, and the shots are very neat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time as this warrior shot, several fighters on the side took the step forward and shot directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the soldiers of the honor guard team, in the midst of a wave of spy shadows and white steam, the other five reincarnations were directly split into two halves. The blood and internal organs were scattered all over the place, and the pungent bloody smell permeated the entire hillside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fear of death, the stimulation of blood, the neat soldiers, the sword that is full of pressure, suppresses the madness of these people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that all of you have calmed down." The sinners on the side let go, and the Archbishop Laurie walked steadily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Seeing the Archbishop!" The first thing to do this is naturally, Su Ge, who is standing by and watching the movie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"See the Archbishop!" Sapir and Horace rushed to salute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The church in March is essentially a family, the etiquette of each other is universal, and the appearance of Laurie is equivalent to the appearance of their own archbishop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Laurie nodded slightly and walked over to Su Ge, with a hint of appreciation: "I have already known everything, Bishop Sogo Sotos You can do this in such a tough condition, and bring such important information, your courage, your discouragement, your loyalty is favored by the goddess."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Su Ge's body is deeper and full of devout response: "Thank you for your approval, thank you for the grace of the goddess. I will wait for the servant to dedicate everything to the goddess."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, get up!" Laurie said, and Su Ge took the lead, and everyone else followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, although the entire hillside is full of people, there are more than 500 people, but it is very quiet, and even can be said to be dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mysterious people who have just made trouble are very nervous. They can clearly understand the four words in the white robe archbishop: unfathomable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Archbishop of the Holy Blood Church is not only an identity, but also a symbol of strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because all the archbishops are the lords! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these sloppy, unorganized, bottom-level mysteries, this level of people is a legendary figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You, don't be nervous." Laurie's voice softened forward, calmly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound is not very big, but it is full of gas, so that hundreds of people on the hillside can clearly hear it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All mysterious people put away their weapons, dissipated psionic powers, and looked up neatly to Laurie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am very clear about the purpose of you. I will not hinder you from entering the city. After all, the ancient city is a public resource and everyone is eligible to enter. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Archbishop said this is true!" At this time, one of the crowd was wearing a gray monk robes, and the middle-aged man with a strong body said loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a master class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lauri continued: "But this ancient city is very dangerous, and there are parasites that can make people crazy. I hope that you can take a rational look at this incident and keep it. Order."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What the Archbishop wants to say, just say it!" said another expert musician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's relax!" The dark star's eyes glanced and the body flashed through. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop!" Laurie said lightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, the shadow that had come to the musician returned to his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inside of the work said kindly: "I will not stop you from entering the city to hunt for treasure, nor will you snatch the things you find, but I hope that you will remember a little. Don't The glory of the goddess from March turns into a monster that is out of control."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Finally, please enter the city in an orderly manner, don't fight and crowd." Laurie seems to be a leader Primary school teacher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of the pressure of the lord, even if these people have a defiant heart, there is no courage to defy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to mention the lord's big-handed shots, the sacred swords of the four-week squadrons alone can kill them all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the matter subsided and continued to move forward, a voice suddenly remembered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please wait a moment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people frowned and turned their heads and talked It is Joel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Laurie faintly asked: "What is the problem with Bishop Joel?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jo The bishop said calmly: "This time after all, there are more than a dozen clerics who have died, and we have to give us some explanations."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do the bishops want to explain?" The master class of asceticism is not good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Joel went one step forward: "The cause of this incident was caused by a female swordsman who killed a captain of our Glorious Church. It is very coincidental. Yes, according to the person present at the time, the swordsman and psionic power used by the female swordsman was exactly the same as the female swordsman who attacked the Bishop of Sotos last night."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was interested in hearing the mentality of the church members around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't think it's a coincidence that these two things are added together. Someone is deliberately provoking the contradiction between the church and you."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, everyone suddenly turned back and looked at the body that was the first to be successful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joel looked coldly at the past, whispering: "Finally let me find you, the church traitor, Vegniya!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, everyone’s eyes looked at the female knight standing in the crowd with a mask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Virginia didn’t expect to be discovered so quickly, she took off her helmet very simply, and a blue sky smiled: "You are on the brain." The waste nose is really sensitive to women, Joel."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Laurie did not speak, waited quietly, and even glanced at Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge was very calm at this time, not happy, not angry, and did not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where are the people who are leaving!" Joel whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vignia said aloud: "I have let her go. She is a poor man who has been enslaved by you. I just saved her." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A nonsense!" Joel pulled out the lightsaber and turned his head and looked at Su Ge. He whispered: "I finally asked you again, where are the people?" !?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vignia took out the sword and did not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Catch the living." Su Ge looked very calm, only said three words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The side of Sapir calmly said: "What are you waiting for, catch this madman!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;After finishing, the four-day clerics were ready to start, but they were blocked by Joel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Viconia is our traitor, not only for us, but also for us. I want to give it to us." Joel said, he walked down the hill with confidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His heart is very arrogant because of yesterday's things can not calm down, want to miss Tongda, you must personally kill this traitor to feed yourself! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why all mysterious people are obliged to report. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is always a thorn in the heart, which will make the heart continually oscillate and affect the stability of the spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laughy said loudly: "Those who have nothing to do with this matter can leave. Please don't be too close to this madman."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one dares to question the authority of this lord-level archbishop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people quickly left the hillside in groups of three, but they didn’t go too far because everyone wanted to watch the show. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone has been admiring the special sacred sword of the Glorious Church for a long time, and today has the opportunity to see that nature will not easily miss it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, it is still rare to see the master bishops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many bishops stand by the Archbishop Laurie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Laurie calmly asked: "Which nun is missing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It is Sarah Sister, she is an ordinary person. The main task of this trip is to help us to cook and cook." Su Ge calmly answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lauri nodded slightly: "How are you going to deal with her?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"People out After the safety is determined, the execution is dead." Su Ge said calmly to the terrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lauri smiled slightly: "I am sure of your determination, Bishop Sotos, but since it is a traitor to the Glorious Church, it is naturally impossible to do so casually." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the conversation, the dark star stared at Su Ge, trying to see a slight change from his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Su Ge’s face is like a long-lasting old oil painting, and he said: “The Archbishop infiltrates and is taught.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next side of Horace smiled and said: "This decision is very appropriate, just take the opportunity to let those people know that the incident is the end of the thorn."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sapir nodded slightly, indicating that he was very satisfied with Joel’s behavior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looks at Joel and Veginiya, who are less than five meters away, and is as calm and calm as the inner and the demeanor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last night, when he told Gerlos to inform Viginia to get into the crowd, everything was in his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has already figured it out, and Vegniya’s unstoppable shot in the face of the Glorious Church also knows that such obvious psionic fluctuations and swordsmanship have been Will be discovered by the people of the Glorious Church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All he is really very calm now, because the grand pavilion is about to be ready. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the hillside, Joel, standing on the hillside, said indifference: "Vigginia, when I saw you for the first time, I knew that you had a bone. You and a team of people are also killing you. "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vignia squinted with a long sword, with a very sweet smile: "Of course, those scum are dead. You, you scum should be smashed and let countless beasts, so that you can avenge those who are humiliated by you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your defamation It doesn't do anything to me, now you can get rid of it." After that, a dazzling light flashed, and Joel came to Vegniya in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vignia has some understanding of his means, and the sword slammed into a blade storm. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "Humph!" <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Lengheng, Virginia Antonia felt a sharp light Instantly acts on your wrist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The violent pain flashed past, and the hand holding the sword had lost consciousness. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "? This is the knowledge of ...... and lighting", Scottish brow of a challenge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark star said faintly: "The holy swords of the Glorious Church are all stained by the mysterious light, and all the holy swords make them want to use this holy light sword. must master enough knowledge associated with light "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Scotland listening understood, and murmured:."! still pretty much it "<br /> < Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Joel’s means, only a few of the mysterious people in the distance saw that he had cut the muscles of Virginia’s wrist with a ray of sharp edges. The person only felt the glimmer of light, and saw Viginia's wrist spurting blood. The long sword missed and threw it out and nailed it on the hillside not far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vignia caught his wrist and receded at the moment he felt a problem with his wrist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While looking back, I looked down and found that my wrist had been cut in half by the sharp edge, the bones were completely exposed outside, and the blood continued to flow from the veins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an expert-level paladin, the control of the body is naturally extraordinary. The muscles of the wrist are instantly manipulated to tighten the blood vessels. Just as he looks up, he sees Joel coming to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not give her any chance to kick on the chest of her chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a bang, the breastplate was broken, and Vegniya’s body was like a hammer, and flew out five or six meters to sit on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The broken breastplate falls, a large mouthful of blood spurts out of her mouth, and her face is sometimes pale, sometimes red, and looks very miserable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the huge gap between masters and experts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gap between the two is like a commando who is proficient in combat, playing with a primary school student who reads two fighting novels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Look, I said that you are a waste, you are destined to be waste." Joel said with a smirk and said that he was coming to Vegginia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When moving forward, his eyes boldly looked at Vegniya’s strong chest and whispered: "The only thing I regret now is that How did you not force you at the beginning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vigny looked ridiculously: "Because you don't have this courage, coward."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait to lock you up, I will pack you up!" Joel tied up Vegniya with a bondage and accelerated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vignia looked up slightly, with a smirk in his mouth: "The premise is that you can live."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The voice just fell! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be careful!" A huge snoring came from behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next moment, he felt his inspiration was like being pierced by countless sharp long needles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole body is swelled and the skin is all goose bumps. Joel's eyes widened, holding his breath, stimulating the psionic power of the whole body, and the whole body glowed back three meters at an extremely fast speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a roar, a huge ice gun with a diameter of half a meter and a length of three meters descended from the sky, just nailed to the place where Joel had just stood. . <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ice gun uses the power of horror to penetrate this hard rock to a depth of one and a half meters, surrounded by cracks and gravel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My God! What is this? Icegun?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Diameter foot Half a meter, is this called an ice gun? Is it too super-sized?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you not notice the speed of this ice gun? Too scary It seems like a bullet that hits out!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The question is, who is this ice gun? Where is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joer’s look is gloomy: “Who is it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also asks about Sapir and Horace Wait for the bishop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They saw the extraordinary and horrible smell of this ice gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lauri did not speak, the dark star frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哗啦......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time the ice gun suddenly burst and exploded, and volatilized in the blink of an eye It became a large white fog, covering a large area with Vegginia as the center. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Encircle here, not let anyone escape!" Sapir and Horace ordered at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark star is also ordered to be on alert. In an instant, hundreds of clerics suddenly stepped forward and surrounded the group of mists. All kinds of weapons were taken out and pointed into the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the face of such a battle, the lord-level people will die!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" There is an ancient saying that it is difficult to fly, it should be described as such a scene!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
