			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The core question now is to find out the source of the mutation, who is offering sacrifices to the ancient gods, causing the entire group to be affected." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since Byron is surviving, it is very likely that after surviving, relying on his own blood and accumulation to build a new dynasty, or faction again. However, the dynasty has completely obscured the identity of the Byron Dias and has become a new race."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The variation is large The scope, even more likely to affect a country, only need to find which country has changed, or has been completely isolated from the world, lose contact, then you can quickly determine the source."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come here, Su Ge's ideas are very clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, Su Ge, who had had breakfast, looked at himself in the mirror. I don’t know if it was an illusion. He felt his dark eyes deep and had A non-human indifference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Should not be affected by the follow-up of the gods?" Su Ge determined his current state of mind and logical thinking without any deviation, as before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Griffin came over and reported: "The bishop, the situation on the school side has already warned the principal, and I will continue to follow up. Gerlos The Archbishop is expected to arrive the day after tomorrow. What other divisions do you have?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Help me check which country has trade isolation in the world recently, or Lost contact," Su Ge said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Griffin didn’t ask much, nodded and said, “This may take some time.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have three days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the command, Su Ge I came to the medical district to find Father Hank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is the professor's situation?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It has calmed down and can speak normally, but because of the fright, some memories are out of order and disorder, it takes some time to recover." Father Hank said, leading Su Ge to the professor's ward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Identity?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bryce Burton, a native of Bain People, pure ordinary people, 44 years old, divorced, son raised by his wife, became a lecture professor in the history department of Bain City ten years ago, and published a book, very interested in the history of the Byron Empire that was annihilated. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you find out who he belongs to?" Su Ge asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hank looked at Su Ge with a weird look: "Are you kidding?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge smiled slightly: "Well, ease the atmosphere."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" How is the identity of the other two people?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hank nodded and said: "Check it out, father and son are locals, father is a primary school teacher. The son is an intern mechanical worker. Both of them have no mysterious experience, do not drink alcohol, occasionally smoke, work and rest, never evade taxes and taxes, and have no criminal record. They are the kind of good people who are safe and respectful."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After hearing this, Su Ge was silent, and then suddenly asked: "French Hank, you said that now, is there a good person who has a good report? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father Hank heard a little bit of discomfort in his eyes and sighed: "This world is so unreasonable."<br /><br />&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugarton remembered the three students who died yesterday. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take a deep breath: "I am going to talk to him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speak, push Open the door and walk in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bryce seemed to be in shock, and his body trembled as he entered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge immediately released the aftermath of the late bell to appease his spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you heard the bell, let Su Ge feel the weird thing appeared, Bryce did not receive the influence of the bell, continue to fear, trembling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This made Su Ge very surprised, and the unsatisfactory night of the town, actually failed in front of this ordinary person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this going on? Is it a deeper impact on his brain? Or is there another hidden thing?" Su Ge thought, soft The voice said to Bryce: "Don't be afraid, here is the Cathedral of the Holy Blood, you are absolutely safe, I am the bishop, Su Ge Sotos. I am here to help you."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bryce was kneeling in bed at the moment, blindfolded with a quilt and did not dare to move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't kill me...I beg you not to kill me..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reassured, I won't kill, I am here to protect you." Suge said, Su Ge held his body and gently injected it into the spirit to appease it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Bryce slowly calmed down and pulled his head out of the quilt. The pale face looked at Su Ge and trembled: "Thank you. You, I feel better."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled and then asked: "Do you have a deep study of the history of Byron the Great?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bryce nodded slightly and did not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where did you see the picture on the blackboard?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On a dilapidated ancient book." Referring to his own research, Bryce seems to have attracted attention, the spirit has gradually stabilized, and the voice has recovered. normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where did you see the prayers you read?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bryce frowns for a moment of contemplation and says, "It’s also in that ancient book."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Go home! Go home! Right! The two monsters want that ancient book!" Bryce suddenly yelled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge immediately asked: "Where is the ancient book?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I was hidden by me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you tell me? I will help you find out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No! You don't want to hit my book." Si was immediately nervous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg’s eyeball turned: “Then we will take you with you, how?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bryce listened to silence for a long time and nodded slightly: "Okay... okay!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, Sug arranged for Jean, Father Anthony, Mother Marlene III The individual took the clergy to escort him to find his books to ensure safety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on his side, there are other things to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the door of the cathedral, when I first came out, I saw that Evan had been waiting there early, laughing and waving at myself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge walked over and found that Evan’s overall spirit has been completely renewed, and his body is full of vigor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go, the mysterious club is not far from here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, two people Walking side by side to a dedicated charity service in Xiangguo Street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This institution is registered in the empire and the church. The so-called diviners are ordinary people and there are no mysteries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their existence is merely a buffer between ordinary people and mysterious people, and allows some people to find some comfort and vent their inner confusion and pressure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, this is the usual situation. According to the historical situation, there are usually mysterious people to patronize, but they dare not be too arrogant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the mysterious world and the church also stipulate that any mysterious person is not allowed to operate here, once found, can be killed on the spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The address of the Stars Divination Guild is located on the edge of the city center. The location is not good, not bad, Zhongzhong and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan is really a frequent visitor here, and after that, he is skilled and chats with the front desk lady in the lobby. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge has a lot of it here and found that it is similar to the structure of the hospital. There is a separate room behind the hall, which should be used for the so-called "diviner". . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, is Mr. Ram Wald in? A friend of mine needs his guidance," Evan asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The front desk lady shook her head after apologizing: "Mr. Wald has not come for three days, it seems to be far away."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Three days? He didn't say where to go?" Evan asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't say it, but when he saw him the most, his spirit didn't seem too good, his face was a little pale, he was cautious and nervous, and he seemed to have encountered something bad. "Things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, the front desk lady is pretending to be pretending: "Mystery is like this. When you help others, you will often encounter bad things. You can be careful in the future!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan nodded with a smile and turned to look at Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger then asked: "Do you know the address of his family?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Immediately shook his head: "At this time, our company's secrets, we can not publicly announce."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge took out his own church token and said: "I am The clergy of the church now suspect that Ram Ward has been involved in a murder. He needs to find him to investigate and hope that you can cooperate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See Su Ge’s silver token with a metallic luster in his hand, Miss’s face suddenly felt a little nervous, feeling the strong pressure of Su Ge’s, and hurriedly looked down, then said: “Mr. Ram Wald lives in Maple Street 766 No. It’s not too far from here.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge heard the laugh and said, “Thank you, I wish you a wonderful day.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then two people quickly followed the street to 766 Maple Street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sug, do you suspect that he has a problem?" Evan asked temptedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s eyes looked calmly and said: “He is dead.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing this, Evan’s heart jumped and some could not believe it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is life really so casual?" Evan has not been exposed to this circle, and feels unacceptable for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge raised his hand in front of the street, lying on the corner of a dead wild dog, said faintly: "When you come to a certain level, You will find that there is no difference between a person's life and death and a dog."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Evan bowed his head and fell into meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After ten minutes, when the two rushed to Maple Street, they found that they were surrounded by the police, and there were many onlookers around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan's eyes wide open and his heart is more shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge walked calmly, just to see that Jack and Roland had rushed over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey? How did you get here?" Jack asked unexpectedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge directly asked: "Is the dead person a Ram Wald?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "You know!?" Jack was surprised. Then he turned to ask Roland: "Have you invited our bishop?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland spreads the hand: "People are busy people, I can't move."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Okay." Su Ge waved his hand and asked seriously: "There are important clues on this guy. How did you find it here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
