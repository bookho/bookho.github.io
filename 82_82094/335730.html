			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Su Ge was taken back to the palace by the driver, the potion of the potion had begun to attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this time, Su Ge didn’t feel too uncomfortable, but his body was chilly and dizzy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood circulation is slow, and the eyes are dark and full of Venus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vo...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a retching, it’s not the stomach that spits, but It is a big mouthful of blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guards next to him saw the ran out and ran out and informed Mil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mill heard the sprint at a speed of 100 meters, rushed to the front of Su Ge in less than thirty seconds, looked at Su Ge’s face, turned and picked up Su The grid returned to his mysterious workshop at a speed of 100 meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your kid finally opened up!" While running, Mir said with excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge couldn’t hear him talking. He felt his body cold and stiff at this time, just like he was dying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassure, this body is a rare treasure, I won't let you die like this!" Mill's voice was intermittent, and suddenly passed into Suge Brain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Su Ge’s head stunned and passed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Su Ge’s fainting, Mil immediately called his two most powerful assistants, carrying Su Ge back to the dissection room... the operating room for treatment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first step is to open the mouth of Su Ge and pour some transparent medicine into his mouth. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the two hands quickly dispensed the good medicine, one was injected into the neck of Su Ge, and the other was made into a hanging bottle, which was injected intravenously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three prescriptions went down and you can see that Su Ge’s body gradually returned to normal, the heart began to beat normally, and the blood flow rate approached steady. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fast! Take the scalpel over, I want to see if there is any anti-drug in his body!" Mil hurriedly put on his gloves and turned on the electric light on his head and said loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A box of clean and tidy scalpels was handed over, and the models and sizes were complete. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Turn the steam oxygen machine on, he needs enough oxygen." Mill said to pick up the scalpel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marvel turned and seemed to switch, and then an oxygen mask-like thing was worn on Su Ge’s face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proficiently cut the chest of Sug, support the incision with a bracket, and Mir just felt a bit wrong when he bowed his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Back!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, a bit of chilling spurting out of the wound, Directly freeze the walls of the entire operating room with a layer of ice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What a ghost thing!" Mir was full of vigilance and quickly let the two go out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This guy has such a huge anomaly in his body! ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This chill is not an ordinary psionic, nor a spell or a technique, it is more like something more advanced and more pure."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The high-level vampire valued him so much, plus that mysterious organization and attitude, this guy! Is it the incarnation of the storm and the Lord of Death in the world!" "Thinking of this, Mill's heart suddenly glimpsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A moment of silence, Mill’s hands are devoutly said: “The great storm and the Lord of death, I am not malicious, I just want to help your followers, At the same time, let him use the potion safely. I believe that you can feel my sincerity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know if I really heard it, or I used it in my chest. After all, the coldness of the entire space gradually subsided and the temperature slowly returned to normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Milton was relieved and his heart flashed awe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going to Su Ge again, he turned on the lighting and entered from the chest incision, seeming to look for something in the chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The normal anti-drug organ of the demon hunter should be above the liver, the part of the chest close to the diaphragm, connected to the liver through a large number of blood vessels."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, no organs. That's weird, where is the toxic antibody of this guy condensed?" Mill fell into meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The line of sight looked in the chest for a while, and when he looked at the heart of Su Ge, he suddenly stood up and his face paled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪嗒! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the undecided, his spirit has risen a bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is that? Heart? Ice? Or a certain creature!?" Mille felt a little trembling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just, he saw an ice-blue thing in the heart that was slowly creeping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, is creeping. It doesn't beat like a heart, but creeps in the chest! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But that thing has no biological characteristics and looks more like a blue ice cube. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although I am very curious, I don't want to find death. The secret of God's incarnation is not something that I can pry into." Mill thought, not afraid. Go and see the weird ice heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since there is such a weird organ, then his anti-drugs on the potion are not in the regular position, maybe near the heart? Or by that The mysterious heart is directly swallowed into one? This is possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking in the heart, Mill did not dare to continue to explore, pick up the support frame, and put the chest of Sug Carefully docked the sides of the incision, turned and took out a dark red potion and injected it into the Suge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the injection of the drug, the wound on the chest of Su Ge slowly recovers at a rate visible to the naked eye, and it seems that it can heal completely in two hours. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
