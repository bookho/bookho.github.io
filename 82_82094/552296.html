			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Andrew recovered almost, Su Ge said: "If it is really parasitic by mental parasites, we will not be too difficult next."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Andrew did not ask, he tore the armor that had been smashed in his body, revealing the delicate upper body full of scars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You should all see it?" Andrew asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly: "See."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadow of the Holy Grail of the Great Soul It is from this underground rising, both people have experienced the feeling of being affected by that virtual shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s still good that the night clock of Su Ge’s soul is very strong, actually suppressing that kind of tremor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Andrew whispered: "According to some records in the abyss, the Holy Grail can exist anywhere, even as long as it thinks, can exist in the past history, Even in someone’s memory.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge understood this: “That is, for many years, the Holy Grail of the Soul is likely to stay there for thousands of years. Before, Carl was in the memory of his death, and this time they passed Carl's skull, will be at that time, the memory of the Holy Grail is summoned?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrew Shaking his head: "I don't know this very well. I am just a warrior, not a senior mystery."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said, he tore off his sleeves The upper strip binds the hilt and the palm of the hand together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t have a little finger, and now the strength of the sword is not as strong as before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speaker is unintentional and the listener is interested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge has become accustomed to the analysis and association of such clues, and most of the time, the truth of the matter and his analysis are not bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Holy Grail is one of the origins, and can even ignore the boundaries of time and space." Su Ge's heart is constantly amazed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time is a line that doesn't bend straight, and people leave their own footprints that cannot be changed at every point in time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This footprint is called history. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone has countless self in time, yesterday is a self, and today is a self, tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, even the first second, This is the second second. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although they are all themselves, each one is not the same,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not just The body structure is more representative of the definition of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are every minute, even every moment of continuous continuity, is a proof of the existence of a person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Holy Grail is different, the existence of the Holy Grail is unique and not continuous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it is the source, it does not need to continue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Grail exists today, and the Holy Grail yesterday was not convinced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Grail of the source, it will always be at the source, not at any other time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as people walk in the river for a long time, they will leave countless shadows behind themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the Holy Grail does not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not continuous, but it is there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People can't write about its form, all things about it can only exist in the ever-changing legends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very weird, unpredictable gesture that ordinary people cannot understand and cannot distinguish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger’s understanding of the Holy Grail is just a stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shaking his head, Su Ge recovered his thoughts from the seemingly meaningless philosophical thinking, only to find that Andrew and Randall are I looked at myself with a strange look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's wrong?" Su Ge slightly moved some sour feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You just got into the same position and stood still for half an hour," Andrew said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge squinted and then sighed and said, "Let's go and teach these monsters."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, three people walked out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just two steps away, Su Ge suddenly said: "And Andrew, there is one thing I need to talk to you in advance."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Andrew looked at him with doubts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Karl's skull, you can't take it away," Suge said earnestly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andre has indicated no change, asks: "Give me a reason to convince me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I want to get the Holy Grail of the Soul, and I need this skull as a skeleton to stabilize the shape of the Holy Grail." Su Ge did not lie, very straightforward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrew’s eyes tightened and it was clearly shocked by the idea of ​​Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Silence for a full ten seconds, his face was extremely dignified and asked: "Do you know how crazy you are doing now? I am though I don't know what the essence of the Holy Grail is, but I still know that human beings can't touch and master the Holy Grail. All the people who sacred the Holy Grail are very dead. Byron the Great, Carl is a forerunner."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge is sincere and seriously replies: "I have my method, I only hope that you do not stop, and understand me."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrew is silent again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he said, he is only a warrior. In addition to fighting, he has a lot of thinking in his mind, even awkward, he can’t understand The method of the grid, even more can not understand the purpose of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know what to ask, so he asked, "If you can get the Holy Grail, what are you going to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give the world salvation." Su Ge did not say too much, directly and succinctly answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrew brows tightly, he can't understand what salvation in this sentence means, but he faintly feels that Su Ge is not malicious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beast's perception is very keen, he bears the wolf blood, and is more convinced of his own perception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you violate what you said today, I will kill you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrew Said, the eyes are full of milky light: "At all costs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge grinned: "I hate the feeling of betrayal, especially betrayal. Own people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ande nodded slightly and resumed silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The side of Randall looked at this somewhat clumsy and simple warrior, patted him on the shoulder and whispered, "Mr., you should feel lucky." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrew understood the meaning of this, and smiled and nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, it’s a normal person who meets Su Ge’s three views. If you meet other people, maybe the hooded man who has been cheated will turn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge, who walked in front of him, smiled: "Randall, don't underestimate the wolf's perception. Things are grouped together to group, if I am such a person, Andrew Instinct will not give me the chance to approach him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Randall listened to his thoughts and suddenly looked blank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three people in the conversation went out from the passage and looked at it. This is a huge oval underground cavity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The height is at least thirty meters and the diameter is about two hundred meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part of the surrounding stone is a raised stalactite, and some stones are filled with honeycomb-like hollows, as if there were any bugs inhabited inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are seven or eight giant stalactites protruding from the ground in front of them. The diameter is generally about three meters, and the height directly leads to the top of the space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ground is fairly flat, with many small otters to indicate the humid environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Around the huge stalactite column, stood as a guardian of more than a dozen people as Andrew said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most conspicuous is the ten-meter-high, black-haired body with a deformed robotic arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some clergy around him, as if the monsters in the game are constantly wandering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side not far away, stood five people wearing worn clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They wore ordinary linen clothes, their hair was a little messy, with a broad sword in one hand and an old flintlock in one hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that there is no difference between ordinary people and ordinary people, but because of the shabby burlap on his eyes, Su Ge is full of vigilance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This special outfit, he only saw it in the sunken Byron City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "These five people are very dangerous." Su Ge said seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andu nodded in agreement: "Yes, my eyes and fingers are cut off by them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge squeezed his cane and said: "Randall, help Andrew to deal with the five people, these clerics handed me over."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Andr turned to look at Randall, his face said with a little weirdness: "I was fighting for the first time with a high vampire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lan Del snorted: "I was also the first to fight with the Wolf Warrior."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the perspective of two people, the higher vampire seems to be with the wolf blood The warrior has some holidays. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge thinks that the night is called the shadow of the abyss, and as the overlord of the night, the Hearst family will certainly have some conflict with the Wolf Legion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three people are separated from each other, two people follow the wall, choose the farthest distance from these clergy, go straight to the few blindfolders . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪叽! Hey! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black leather boots stepped on the otters, and the crisp sound echoed in such a large space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug has a steady walking towards the fully controlled clerics with a cane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the approach, the Holy Sword and the scepter first discovered Su Ge and turned to see Su Ge for a moment, without saying anything, pulling out the weapon The rapid rushed over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thick bell rang out of Su Ge’s body and quickly spread around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five clergymen were momentarily stiff in the moment they heard the bell, and then the whole body began to tremble fiercely, seemingly trapped in some kind of struggle. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s body is a forehead, and the master’s voice blade flashes past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, the heads of five people were instantly cut off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five clerics, like humans, have no scales and equipment to defend against the sharp edges. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head was cut off, accompanied by a gushing blood column, five bodies slowly fell, and then five dark mental parasites from their bodies Gradually appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With previous experience, Su Ge is now very skilled and calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cane becomes a long sword, waving a few times and directly killing these monsters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrew, who had just walked a few steps away, looked back and immediately saw a ghost-like expression: "What?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
