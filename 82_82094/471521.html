			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going to the City, Guinness Palace, 12:00 midnight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas in a dark black dress sat behind a large desk with two people in front of her, one at a time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a middle-aged man with a gray hair and a look of fifty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wore a black suit, his white hair was neatly combed, and the gray beard of his chin made him look elegant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was wearing white gloves, and there was a silver-gray box on the left side of the body with the logo of the Church of the Holy Blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside him is a cold young man in a black trench coat with no expression, standing like a statue standing next to a middle-aged person, motionless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas looked at two people, with an elegant and calm smile asked: "The Archbishop of the ruling station quietly came to my study, I don’t know What's the matter?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged smile: "How does the Queen know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vana Sis raised the index finger coated with black nail polish to refer to the white gloves of the middle-aged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the edge of the glove, there is a very inconspicuous gold pattern, it is a cross with a long sword and a big axe on it, this is The sign of the Church of the Holy Blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold, is the iconic color of the Archbishop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have a good eye, it is a descendant of General Guinness." After the middle-aged man finished, he introduced himself: "My name is Laurie Burton. Under the ruling, in order to implement the Archbishop, this is my assistant, you can call him a dark star."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas nodded: "You Come here, are you going to arrest me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Laurie smiled: "Your wife is joking, the Guinness family has proved it for thousands of years. Loyalty to the church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If it weren't for me, should that be the investigation of Soge Sotos?" Vanas asked again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Laurie nodded: "Exactly, we received some information confirming that Sog Sotos joined a cult and violated March. The goddess' faith."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas said directly: "There is indeed a thing, he joined an organization called the Church of the Night Bell."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Laurie has some surprises: "Since you know, why not report to the church?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Why should I report?" Vanas directly responded strongly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't let go!" The dark star suddenly sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas's eyes turned into a darkness, and a strange black breath permeated through her skirt, like countless tentacles in the dark. Swing, waiting for an opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who told you to talk!?" Vanas was like a person, his voice was low and solemn, with a burst of solemn echo, giving An inexplicable sense of oppression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark star instantly took a book from under the robes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's relax." Laurie's voice sounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark star hurriedly put away the book and bowed his head and did not dare to speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lauri turned his head and said with apologetic: "Sorry, Your Majesty. Please don't mind."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The rich death temper gradually gathered, Vanas returned to normal: "The Archbishop Burton, you have to position the church. You know how much we paid for this, now we are the Guinness family. The soul is still in this palace, and I was cursed into this appearance, the Church of the Holy Blood seems to have not made any compensation for our family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lauri Naturally knowing the secret, I apologized and said, "I am very sorry, Her Majesty. This is indeed a mistake of the church. When I came out this time, His Majesty the Pope deliberately asked me to ask your opinion, the church here. Will cooperate vigorously."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas faintly snorted: "The Archbishop of Emilia and I have guaranteed the absolute autonomy of Guinness. The Church of the Holy Blood has only missionary rights in the country and is not qualified to interfere with the kingship. Although Sogo Sotos Do some small moves in the dark, but this has no harm for our royal family, and even beneficial to our rule. If there are benefits, why should I report it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Laurie said bluntly: "The cult is a cult after all. There is no problem for the time being, but for a long time, let Sog Sotos confuse the people in the name of the church and win the believers. This is not good for His Majesty's rule. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas's ruddy mouth has a slightly ironic smile: "Does Archbishop Burton really think that this emperor is an idiot?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course not, don't misunderstand." Laurie shook his head again and again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas raised his chin slightly, confidently and proudly said: "Sug Sotos is indeed a means of adventure, but he is just a joiner. The civilians at the bottom of the church, the political means of which are very naive and ridiculous. I now take the curse of the Great God of Death and inherit some of the power. I now have absolute control over the entire city. His secret means Everything is under my watch, and it can even be said that I allowed him to carry out, and he can carry it out. The few believers he has developed today are my subjects."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lauri heard this, a glimmer of light in the deep eyes, praised: "Your knee is really a good means."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was the original If you want to make Suge Sotos the bishop here, it means that I have absolute confidence to control him. I don't want the Church of the Holy Blood to intervene in my rule. Do you understand?" Vanas seems to be in the dark eyes. There is some kind of black light flowing slowly, which is very strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lauri nodded: "Know. But this time I hope that you can cooperate with us, because today's Suger Sotos is involved in a very important case. I need to bring back the ruling for interrogation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He is leaving, I have no opinion, but if you take him away, I don't want You insert a nail into me," Vanas said faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lauri tempted: "What do you mean..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After Su Ge Sotos left, I am the bishop here, you don't have to send someone to come."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This..." Laurie fell into meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This matter is very important. I need to discuss it with the central authorities." Laurie said truthfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas did not kill this thing: "This is your problem, I care about my interests and the authority of the royal family."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can rest assured that this church will give you a satisfactory answer." Laurie vowed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas nodded: "When do you start?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not an emergency We need to conduct a detailed investigation of him and then need him to perform a mission." Laurie seems to be ready. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wanasien said: "Is there anything else?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lauri For a moment, the tester asked: "The one is still here, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas sneered: "I hope he is not here. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Laurie smiled and picked up the box and said, "I’m disturbing today, thank you for your cooperation and support. Please rest assured, Guinness. The kingship will not be subject to any infringement."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the two men respected the ceremony, the body stepped back two steps and disappeared into the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When two people left, Vanas leaned back in the chair, his mouth smirked with a ribbon of irony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the palace, with the dark mist, Laurie appeared on the street with a dark star. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Archbishop, is she credible?" asked the Dark Star. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Laurie touched his chin: "There is no problem in terms of logic and motivation. Sogo Sotos does not know that we suddenly came to investigate him. This kind of unilateral inquiry is very credible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But this is not absolute. Sogo Sotos can reach Guinness tomorrow. At that time we will monitor it." Laurie said, with a glimpse of it, a lot of black things like a paper crane disappeared. In the dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark star said with a slight disappointment: "This small thing actually allows you to personally take the shot, is the church a little fuss?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sug Sotos is leveled by the level of the expert and the master of the Nell, even if Nell has reservations at the time, but this powerful profession and knowledge is enough People were shocked. Emilia intends to use Su Ge’s foreign card as her own card, but she did not expect to be lured by Nell in advance.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The law, the bells and the sound waves, is it really the descendant of that one?" The dark star said, his expression was slightly shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one, the many legends left in the world, the god of death, the sinner, the sinner, the lord of the valley, the mourner of God, etc. Wait, too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Laurie looked at the sky: "So the great saints let me come. If there is an accident, you must kill him in advance and preserve the integrity of the soul." In order to refine the complete knowledge and professional structure."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark star whispered: "Let your lord-level shadow hunter deal with one Expert-level little people, always feel..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Less less blame, more action." Laurie said, not speaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark star shrinks his head, and his face is behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the border of the kingdom, in a brand new lord castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug sat in a chair and drank a cup of coffee with a satisfied face: "This is life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; In front of the castle owner, a 40-year-old lord of the Viscount bowed and respectfully said: "Your Majesty, the two churches of the Holy Blood did not pass through the normal level, but through the other side of the mountain road. Come over, but the wolf's nose is very good, smelling that unique bloody smell."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
