			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first two women who were shocked and undecided, then threw the bodies of the two Krakens back into the sea to complete the destruction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge said: "The bugs should find everyone in the Cthulhu Order. The Krakens who come to the ship will attack all who see them. Ordinary people's vision is completely incapable of reaching 28 points, so all those who suffer from them are mysterious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After all, the vision is not Will deceive people." Su Ge analyzed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley looked at the waves in front and said, "It seems to be arriving at their destination tonight."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg heard this close his eyes and carefully sensed it, at this time he clearly felt an invisible fluctuation linked to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on the other side of the link, there was a constant impact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Son of God has begun to hit my seal." Su Ge opened his eyes and said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl asked: "What are your plans?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now all The worms were all crushed, and then Drake was transformed into a person I needed." Suge said confidently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl asked: "Who?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nature is a hero, a Kill all the cultists and save the heroes of everyone.” Sug’s mouth with a malicious smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After that he will be smug, self-respecting. After arriving at Huicheng City He will become a big hero through the promotion of journalists and police, temporarily into the upper class, see many big people, and become celebrities."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snow Lill did not use the brain that was much smarter than Su Ge. He continued to ask: "After?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge took out a dilapidated pocket watch and looked back at the sea behind him: "The sand will push him to the top and heroically die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley The corner of the mouth is full of satisfaction with a wicked smile: "I like this feeling of acting as a behind-the-scenes black hand and playing with other people in the palm of my hand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug followed by the correct color: " You don't have to act, you are a black hand!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the conversation, a voice suddenly remembered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Assassin! Mr. Assassin!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug turned to look I saw a young man in a beige robe and glasses wearing a pale face and ran to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't seem to know you?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man took a breath and quickly introduced himself: "You want Mr. Assassin, my name is Duke Hausman, an antique lover. And the collector. I saw your heroic performance in the theater the day before yesterday and I have some understanding of you. I know that you are a psychiatrist, can you help me see my servant? He suddenly went crazy this morning, now I was tied in the room."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hausman?" Hearing this surname, Su Ge felt a move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If my memory is not wrong, is the world's second-largest asset valuation company, Hausmann?" asked Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The youth listened to some embarrassment: "Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge did not ask much The young man in this big family status calmly said: "You can get a medical treatment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke immediately patted his own thin chest. "You can rest assured that others don't dare to say that I have a lot of confidence in the tariff."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug said with a smile: "Let's go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then Duke cautiously glanced at Shirley next to Suge, no more questions, no more to say, turned and took the lead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley turned to look at Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug has some surprises, because Shirley actually thinks this little bug has some wisdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can make Shirley feel a little wise, and in humans it can be said that people are dragons and phoenixes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looked at Duke’s back, and he began to move some other thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few minutes, two people came to a room on the northeast side of the third floor of the cruise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a house at the corner of the hull wall, which is very large, three times as large as the room in the Soviet Union. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the two walls on the outside of the house are made of the special unilateral transparent glass. Standing in the bedroom, the scenery is magnificent. The sea is very spectacular. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...This is the real rich man." Su Ge sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley seems to be very happy with this room, but she knows how much money she has in her wallet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past year and a half, all the expenses and money were responsible for her. Vanas gave Su Ge’s money completely without Su Ge’s hand. In the hands of Sherry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Shirley’s budgetary ability is indeed not Suger’s. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A year and a half, Vanas gave Suger a budget of 10,000 francs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you let Su Ge come to spend, this Wanlangke is estimated to have spent almost the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But under Sherry’s control, the two people used six thousand francs under the very high level of comfort, and now there are four Thousands of surpluses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compared with Su Ge, Sherry is more aware of what is called "price/performance". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people walked in, first to the living room paved with mahogany floors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The living room is elegant and luxurious, and the surrounding furniture, furnishings and paintings are full of classical charm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle circle of the sofa is empty at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the side, two great men dressed in a sleek black loose suit, next to them, was a tied man with a scorpion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a middle-aged man in his forties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the clothing of middle-aged people, it is a well-dressed gentleman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he was tied to a wooden board at this time, his body was constantly struggling, his eyes were spreading, and his mouth was constantly screaming, it seems Got crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master." After Duke returned, the two great men nodded respectfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke looked at the middle-aged man with some uneasiness and said to Su Ge: "Mr. Assassin, this is my personal butler, but Suddenly going crazy this morning, can you see what the problem is? Is there any hope for cure?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug came over and looked down, in my heart As you know, this housekeeper should see something that he can't understand because of his high vision, which leads to the skyrocketing and madness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger has no way for people who are crazy because of their vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Su Ge did not rush to speak, but looked at Shirley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl clenched his fist and gestured to Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug immediately understood that he turned to look at Duke and said, "100 lang."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Can it be cured?" Duke asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge calmly said: "It’s not cured, but I can let him completely quiet until you return to your family."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear this, Duke is very refreshing and makes a look at the bodyguards on the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listening to the bodyguard, he took out a completely pure gold from his arms and handed it to Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug took over the banknotes and looked satisfied, and checked his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two body-building bodyguards look badly at Su Ge, if they find this young guy is a liar, they don’t mind letting him eat some suffering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two minutes later, Su Ge asked questions to the butler, and opened his eyes, and after hitting his head, stood up calmly and said: "Hao Mr. Sman, first of all, let me tell you why the butler is going crazy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please, please." Duke asked seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge said: "He was mad because he saw something that should not be seen, causing the rise of the visual acuity. According to my calculations, before, Your steward's vision has long since surpassed the normal person's ten-point vision, around fifteen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear this, Duke The look of disappointment said: "You are right, his vision is indeed fifteen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two bodyguards on the side heard this too I was shocked. I didn't expect this young man to have two sons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug continued: "You know very well that there is no turning back in the abyss of the soul. This kind of madness so far has only a few The method can be cured. But this requires the power of the church in March."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke nodded, then tempted and asked: "Do you know what he saw? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge calmly said: "This requires an additional fee."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Ke Sisuo for a second, did not continue to ask: "Please let the butler calm down first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded, bent down, with black gloves The hand was placed on the butler's face, and then whispered in the butler's ear and whispered some incomprehensible words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gradually, the steward’s struggling body gradually subsided, the sly expression returned to normal, the big eyes slowly closed, slightly old face , actually gives a feeling of peace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two bodyguards saw the incredible look of these big eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Duke’s amazed gaze, Su Ge stood up and said, “I gave a psychological hint to his subconscious mind and let him fall into deep sleep. This state lasts for about five days, enough to stick to the Port of Tedu, and as for his nutritional problems, it will be handed over to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke nodded immediately: "No problem, I brought a lot of high-energy and nutritious blood wine this time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing a lot, Su Ge once again lamented the young man’s money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a by-product of blood therapy, blood wine has many characteristics similar to blood therapy, and the core is to produce different effects depending on the blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can even be understood that blood wine is the product of weakening of blood therapy, the general structure and effect are the same, but the effect and speed of play are much slower than blood therapy. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those rich in the upper class, there are even many people who use blood wine as food, and can take blood wine three times a day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adding energy while avoiding excessive intake of energy and debris, maintaining a perfect body shape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for the blood wine, Su Ge and Shili have no interest, because they obviously feel that these blood wine is not a good thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because there are countless symptoms of blood alcohol addiction throughout the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even at the top of the three empire, the shackles and pale faces caused by blood alcohol addiction have become the representative of the nobility and decadent culture of the nobility, even Gradually formed the mainstream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, if there is nothing else, I will leave first, Mr. Hausmann." Su Ge said, turned and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please wait a moment." Duke suddenly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge stopped and looked at him slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
