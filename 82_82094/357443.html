			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While Oliver stopped, Su Ge took a deep breath, and his cane supported his body and slowly stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second time I took the inferior shark potion, Su Ge felt completely different from the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was some pain in this moment of drinking, but it was not as fatal as it was last time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no previous burning sensation in the throat and stomach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, it may be because of the reason for complete adaptation, this time the effect of the shark potion played very fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last 30 seconds before the official effect, and this time only three seconds, the effectiveness is fully played. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, his feelings are similar to the previous ones. He feels that his spirit is unprecedentedly powerful, and the spirit that has just been lost is fully recovered. The spirit of attack has also been obtained. Temporary supplement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the moonlight, the face full of black blood vessels slowly lifted up, a pair of burning flames staring at Oliver, confidently said: "You don't Let me drink this bottle of syrup."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Speaking of ignorance, or are you stupid?" Oliver looked at Su Ge at this time. Look, with a trace of shock, he can of course see what Su Ge had just drank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Drinking the potion in the body of an ordinary person is estimated to be the suggestion that Mill will not die for you?" Oliver asked with a sneer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This stupid thing seems so proud, although I can wait for half an hour for you to die from the potion, but the Lord of the Moon has already gone back. With me, I have disappointed him once and can't let him down for the second time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge took out the ice skull and smirked: " An inferior Yi can be called He? Oliver, your ignorance has opened my eyes today."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shut up! You I don’t know the deep wisdom of the Lord of the Moon at all!” Oliver screamed, and the claws of the great ghost once again caught the body of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hula la la! The sorcerer's psionics can be entered, the cold flames are burning, and the two cold flame elves appear again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of this fierce spiritual attack, the cold cold flame suddenly spread and blocked in front of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嘶嘶嘶...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment the paw hits the flame, it suddenly appears like a bug The sound of the call was extinguished by the burning of the flame in almost a second. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this ghost thing?" Oliver frowned, thinking about a second, his hands slammed two pages on the book of Necromancer. The lips squeaked a few times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next five human ghosts with various weapons appear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the appearance of the five ghosts, the pale eyes instantly locked the Su Ge, then opened his mouth and waved the sword in his hand and rushed toward it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five ghosts floated in the air under the control of Oliver, surrounded Su Ge in five directions, and then rushed forward and launched an attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, the huge ghost who lost a paw quickly collapsed back into Oliver's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And here, Oliver closed the book and whispered a long spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of these five ghosts, Su Ge took the lead in propping up a night clock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ripples spread out, and the sharp night blade sharply spreads into a hemispherical shape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啊呜呜呜......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in a crying voice, five ghosts The body was cut off instantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not waiting for Sugson's tone, the next second will quickly recover, and instantly came to Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the attack of the five ghosts, the night bell is instantly broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nailed his cane to the ground, and the skull in his left hand blew a one-meter flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This soul seems to be very afraid of this kind of flame, actually hiding in two meters, afraid to come forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug saw an effect, and turned around to use flames to defend other souls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the turn of Su Ge, the two souls immediately rushed up like a mad dog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, at this time two cold flame elves quickly rushed over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the body is small, but it can be instantly turned into two huge ice flames, directly igniting the two rushing ghosts and burning them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The skull of Su Ge’s left hand blocks the two ghosts on the left, facing the ghost on the right, the hand with the black glove suddenly squeezes the fist, the body is skilled After sneaking away from the ghost's big knife attack, he slammed his fist on his head and used his fist to fly out the ghost without physical. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the characteristics of black leather gloves is that they can be exposed to things that normal people cannot reach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the two flames of the cold flame elves flew back, like a mad bee, quickly rushed to the other two souls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In silence, the five souls are burned by the flames of ice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Su Ge has just solved these five souls, turning his head just to see Oliver open his eyes and sneer: "You don't need this kind of person." I personally shot and shred you by these most important nobles!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, accompanied by a mess of wolverine, dozens of whole body The dark werewolf rushed out of the banquet hall and ran towards it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this, Su Ge glanced slightly at Vanas and said calmly to Oliver: "You can't see it, you are really smart." ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas saw this, holding his brother's hand was very bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These nobles are very important to her for this country. They are the key wealth class and the assistant and tool of her ruler. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without these core aristocrats, the entire empire will instantly become a mess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Vanas has a qualified lord in his hands, and the qualified finance minister can’t find it, let alone the elite soldiers hired by these nobles. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kill or not kill! ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s dangerous not to kill yourself, killing the whole country will fall apart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sister!" Jean was flustered at the moment and looked at Vanas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The side of Hills said casually: "Reassure me to Mr., there is him, your country will certainly be safe."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas immediately listened to his heart and said with ease: "Yes! There is also the Pope!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, she has no intention of concealing her relationship with Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The werewolves who became more than fifty nobles came to Oliver’s side, glaring at scarlet eyes, licking their fangs and drooling. The mouth, like a dog, squatted on the ground, staring at Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, my children, shred this guy!" Oliver shouted, his attitude full of confidence and irony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, more than fifty werewolves made a horrible roar, crazy towards Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s graceful open arms, smiled and said: “Sorry, Mr. Lord, I may have to make you angry again.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thick bell sounded again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
