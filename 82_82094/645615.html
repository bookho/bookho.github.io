			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When everyone swung around Drake, Su Ge quietly left the crowd, releasing the night bell to find Mary's trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Su Ge is also with Bart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two years have not seen, Bart is very curious about Su Ge's current means, ready to observe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug did not refuse, Bart’s meaning to him is extraordinary, and many of his own knowledge about the mysterious world can be said to be told by Bart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he has a good impression and gratitude for Bart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about your lover?" Bart asked casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge whispered: "Are you a noble drink of blood, a brain full of sperm?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart laughs: "Life always needs to find something interesting, and women are a very important part of it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He reached out and hugged Su Ge's shoulder: "Occasionally, it is very exciting to play, and I don't even say that I am actually married."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Gee had already seen the ring in his hand, and put his hand down: "If this is to let my family know that you are now being flattened."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Su Ge bent over and picked up a stone and put it on the palm of his hand. The vibration came and the stone was instantly flattened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's not a joke, it's a real sense of flatness, like this stone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Bart listened to his eyes wide open: "She is stronger than you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge spread his hands and did not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people in silence walked along the edge of the path to the dark corner near the west side of the manor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait, your fiancee, willn't you be the one you protect in the ancient city?" Barth suddenly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled: "You are not stupid."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough cough ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this answer, Battton was picked up and began to cough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug saw his wolverine look and laughed, and the night clock released was also given back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the left corner of the huge manor, two people are now pulling Mary's arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that Mary has been tied, and the constant struggle has no effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the bush near the warehouse, there is a third person, who is standing there and motionless, seems to be waiting for something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s nose moved and he said, “I’m getting a bad taste.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What smell?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The taste of blood."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the end, the two men stepped up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the calm, steady pace, self-confident Su Ge, Bart is a bit embarrassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he returned to the museum with Su Ge to pursue the staff of the Green Flame Brotherhood, then Su Ge was still trembled, ignorant, nothing I know, I almost lost my life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, after two years of meeting, he clearly felt that he had left himself behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, he is leading himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart is not in conflict with this feeling, he is only marveling at his original vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The investment at that time is now a huge return. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Mary has been brought to the innermost hidden position by two expressionless attendants, surrounded by thick bushes, left on the outside It is the courtyard wall, and the rear is the back wall of the house warehouse. There is only one small road in the middle, which is very concealed and quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A look is a good place for secret retreats and field battles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two attendants randomly left Mary on the ground, then stood still and motionless, like a zombie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You...who are you? I am an ordinary person, I don't know anything..." Mary said palely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man came out of the shadows, and by Moonlight Mary found that the person himself did not know at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face is a little pale, wearing gray-white clothes on his body, his body is thin, and his cheeks are like a mole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The collapsed eye sockets have deep eye bags, with a pair of eyes shining with scarlet rays in the middle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked out quietly, sticking out his tongue and pouting, "The great Lord likes your blood."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Mary suddenly trembled fiercely, and opened his mouth and shouted out, but in the moment of opening his mouth, he suddenly found that he could not make any sound anyway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man took out a weird scimitar from his arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This knife is about thirty centimeters long, dark and sharp, with a scary bloodletting groove on the back of the knife, which makes people look very chilly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This kind of slightly contaminated mysterious blood, and this faint divinity, is simply the best blood, no wonder my Lord has brought me here." The man said With obsessive on the face, step by step, sticking out the scarlet slender tongue and licking the blade, very abnormal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary was completely scared at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Help me! Who will save me!" Mary struggled desperately, but it did not help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as she was about to be overwhelmed by fear and the spirit collapsed, the familiar late bell sound came again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, her fearful heart was calmed by this sacred bell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The perverted man who came to his body stopped now and looked at the direction behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary has been completely relieved at this time, she is very clear what this bell represents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her true hero, is coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This disgusting bell, and the eager psionic power, finally found you, heresy." Young pinches the scimitar, binocular Staring at Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge walked behind Mary unhurriedly, responding to the man’s question: "You bloodstakers ran here, are they a bit too arrogant?" "?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hunter? Gemini Alliance?" The side of Bart is somewhat unexpected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main force of the Twin Alliance is in the Storm Plateau, which believes in the blood of the twins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge has dealt with the organization several times, and overall it is a good relationship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man lifted his knife and opened his mouth: "Your blood, the great goddess will like it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, the youth raised their arms with enthusiasm, and the body disappeared into the darkness for a moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart immediately said: "Expert-level thieves, be careful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug mouth A sneer sneer, suddenly raised his hand as he watched Bart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
