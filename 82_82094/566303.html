			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of Su Ge, the middle-aged man hurriedly apologized and said, "I am sorry, I am too excited."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly: "There is something to say slowly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The side of Shirley looked at the middle-aged man and suddenly said: "I remember that you are the people of the four colleges?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger heard that the heart had an understanding of the expression of the middle-aged man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man nodded hard, stepped back and put his hand behind him. He said, "Let me introduce, my name is Albert." Laris is the co-teaching director of the College Alliance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl said to Su Ge: "That day, he led the team."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Suge, he was not surprised and nervous. In the past year and a half, the two of them did not deliberately hide their identity because he was very clear about himself. The strength, even if they know that they are still alive, but they do not dare to rush. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Laurie said, the March goddess is never wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since they said that Su Ge died, Su Ge died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter how alive is alive, the name Suger Sotos is already the name of the dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert tempted and asked: "Excuse me, you are now called..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge smiled: "The name is just a code name. You call me Mr. Black Mist."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert immediately nodded after listening: "I am honored. I saw you, Mr. Black Mist."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My companion and I have been hungry. If you have anything, we can talk at the table." I have already felt that Shirley is a little impatient. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert saw that Sug did not directly reject himself and hurriedly said, "Okay! Please come here, we have just prepared a box." ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saying, use your eyes to the companions around you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man immediately comprehended, smiled and turned and ran out, estimated to be preparing for the "already prepared box." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Five minutes later, sitting in a delicate and elegant box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The servant came up with three delicious appetizing fish soups and then went down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge took a sip and took a sigh of relief: "It’s so comfortable, it’s good to eat in the city.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sherry at the side of this time squinted and enjoyed, very satisfied with the soup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opposite Albert did not drink soup, at this time he looked nervously and looked at Su Ge: "Please forgive my offense, Mr. Black Mist, I Just... some are too excited."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug took the silk scarf and wiped his mouth and said, "I can feel your courtesy, so we can now I have dinner together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert listened and nodded, then sighed with a sigh: "Actually, I have been looking for you for a year and a half. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Looking for me? A year and a half?" Su Ge stunned, some accidents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert smiled and said that he and the students’ promises were very good. Su Ge’s face was very wonderful. He didn’t know when he was more. So many fans and sisters? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl has now fallen into his own world, savoring the fish soup, and is completely uninterested in what two people say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert tempted and asked: "Do you think so?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What can I do? Go to teach?" Su Ge eyebrows pick one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alber features nod. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge puts his hand on the wave: "This is not a play, I am not a class. I was just a regular college graduate about two years ago. People. Although it has been smooth all the way, but my own mysterious knowledge, I know very well that some things I don’t want to understand, let alone teach.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Albert hurriedly said: "You should not rush to refuse, you may have misunderstood the concept of this teaching."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is interested in asking: "say Say it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert looked seriously at Su Ge and explained: "The teaching here is not to let you talk about some basics and textbooks. The people in that city were the top students of the four colleges. They have a very good foundation. What they really need is the social knowledge related to life and actual combat in mystery. I have been admiring your legendary experience for a long time. You can say that you are dealing with those horrible and dangerous cultists."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As you said, you may not be perfect in terms of foundation, but in society On the sexual side, your knowledge is very important for those students who are not deeply involved."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge was mired in listening to his chin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert is not talking, waiting quietly. After half a minute, Su Ge looked up and said, "You should be very clear about my current identity. Although the face is dead, the three churches actually know." I am still alive, and I am very comfortable. If there is an opportunity, they will not give up. Accept me, this means that you have violated the interests of the church in March."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Albert listened to his heart and let out a sigh of relief. He was afraid that Su Ge had no image at all. He was the kind of person who did not enter the oil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing that Su Ge did not directly refuse, he hurriedly explained: "This is your peace of mind, the four colleges as the cornerstone of the whole mysterious world, independent of the church system In addition, even if the church really finds you, we are absolutely confident to ensure your safety."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge did not agree to listen, quietly drinking soup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point the waiter walked in to bring the rest of the dishes up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ocean City's signature large lobsters, sea turtles, etc., are expensive cuisines that are not available elsewhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嘎嘣嘎嘣......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley picked up the big lobster and even put the big lobster's cheek into the mouth and started chewing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole room was quiet and only heard the harsh chewing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge has no interest in seafood. He doesn’t like the seafood taste of seafood and is still drinking soup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert took a sip of soup and volunteered to say: "In fact, if you can become a teacher of the college league, there are many benefits."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When mentioning the benefits, Su Ge’s heart moved, but did not say, continue to drink soup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The source of the four colleges is actually from the Kabatos Academy, and each college’s central library contains many ancient secrets, including From the ancient gods to the fourth dynasty, there are many detailed records." Albert continued to test. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing the ancient gods, Su Ge was very happy, but his expression was very calm, calmly asked: "I have a problem."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You please speak."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know the phone?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley, who is eating shrimp, pauses and continues to eat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert heard the vocabulary and suddenly fell into a deep contemplation. About two minutes later, Albert hesitated and said: "I seem to have heard that this phone seems to be a tool for people to communicate in ancient times, and now The telegraph is somewhat like."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge was shocked. He didn't expect Albert to actually know the word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where do you know?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert said casually: "It was recorded in Dr. Apollo’s handwriting, and I saw it by accident."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Archaeologist, Apollo!?" Su Ge asked unexpectedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arber features nodded: "Yes, he was born in the Sanctuary of the Secret Law. He once worked as an extracurricular teacher in the college league. Later he died because he had no future generations. He entrusted him to the college league to help him manage his affairs. The handwritten notes were placed. In the central library of the Sanctuary of the Sanctuary."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, I suddenly got a huge interest in Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In this case, your proposal is indeed worth considering." Su Ge nodded slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert’s heart is full of joy: “Then you...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Urgently, we have been running in the world for more than a year, ready to rest here, your proposal will answer you four days later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert immediately Nodded: "Okay! No problem, I am waiting for your good news."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After dinner, two people dressed in casual clothes walked in the lively streets on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a first-tier city, the evening in Ocean City is very lively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lot of people coming in and out of theaters, circuses, bars, and hotels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still a beautiful fireworks on the central square in the distance, adding a bustling coat to the city that never sleeps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you really want to teach?" Shelly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly: "Well, our news is too occluded, we need to open more channels for getting news. The College Alliance leads the four colleges, it can be said that the whole mystery The cornerstone of the world, where it is absolutely neutral, not only can you see the church people, but you can also see many cults. Of course, the latest ones that attract me are the four libraries that are treasure houses."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley looked up at the sky and suddenly asked: "Do you think so much every day, not tired?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s not tired, I’m used to it.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge first replied, then sighed: "From the day I listened to an old man, the greater the ability, The greater the responsibility. I thought he was farting. At that time, I was thinking that I had the ability to fly high, and what about your life and death?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
