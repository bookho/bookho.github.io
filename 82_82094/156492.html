			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sen's Black Goat..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this name, two people muttered Whispering, my mind is running fast, I want to find the corresponding vocabulary from my own knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, they have never heard of this name despite their contemplation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge interrupted their thoughts and explained: "You should not go too far into this name, the existence of that one, its status is even far The one who surpassed the faith of the Green Flame Brotherhood. The existence of that one is more than the limit you can imagine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, the two hearts A glimpse, rushing to converce the mind is not thinking much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black man’s affairs can’t be solved for a while, and Su Ge put the matter down and watched the two people say: “I passed the last night with my main ditch. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hearing this, the two people are in a tight heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the current results, the results achieved by the two people are very bad, and it can even be said that they have not reached the requirements of the Lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are afraid of causing the Lord’s wrath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug can see the tension between the two people, and said to the gods: "My master knows the result and is very dissatisfied with the result."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pump! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart of two people jumped at the same time, almost jumping out of the eyes of the blind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a turn of Su Ge’s words: "Although the results are not good, my Lord has seen your piety and loyalty. Therefore, the merciful Lord does not intend "Falled to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, the two men suddenly sighed and said in unison: "Thank you for the kindness and magnanimity of my Lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge changed his tone and looked at the two calmly: "Your piety has been approved by my lord, so my lord agrees that you will join our church and become my The believer of the Lord accepts the refuge of my Lord. But because this matter is too badly handled, you will not be able to receive any gift from my Lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people are very happy to hear this. How dare they pray for gifts now? I have the opportunity to join this new church and hold on to the reality that the thigh of that one is more than what the gift is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you for the gift of my Lord, thank you for the greatness of my Lord!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge raised his hand and stopped: "My lord hates these clichés and hypocritical rituals, and cares more about inner worship and piety."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the completion, Su Ge’s face was inscrutable and said: “Do you really think that the gods will care about these hypocritical actions? These actions are just the vanity of those who believe in the false believers!” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing the two men’s feelings of nod and nod. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two are old monsters that have lived for many years, and they are very familiar with the hypocrisy of people, so the two people agree with Su Ge’s words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question Sugue asked: "How is Hills and Heines?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "The two of them were directly affected by the aftermath of the explosion, and the injuries were heavy, but the problem was not big," said Randall, a doctor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, Randall had a weird addition on his face: "There are some weird things, a rupture in their two internal organs. But my child When I saw it, I found that the ruptured visceral wound had obvious fogging. I looked at it this morning and found that the broken internal organs had completely recovered. I have never seen the witch have such ability."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s face with admiration: “This is the gift of my Lord. Both of them accepted the gift of my Lord, and thus gained a glimpse of the power of my Lord. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adeline heard this suddenly thought that Su Ge had said that the sarcoma problem that cured the witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Randall heard this more firmly believe that his new faith can save himself from the curse of the blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is Bart??" Su Ge suddenly thought that Bart’s situation was very bad last night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Randall shook his head: "Not quite sure, he seems to have his own method, he hasn't seen it overnight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turned to look out the window, the sun Has risen high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have to go to the police station to get to know the follow-up of things. You are here to take care of Hills, and we will see you later."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people nodded and promised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Su Ge came out of the room, the first thing he saw was the Church of the Holy Blood, not far from here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The direction seems to be in the wealthy area south of the city." Looked at the exquisite villas, new street lights, the snow on the ground has not yet had time. Cleaned, the white horses pulled the metal-built four-wheeled carriages and walked through the streets briskly and elegantly to the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge slaps the dust on his hat and wears it on his head and trots all the way to the police station not far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Su Ge came to the police station, he found that the police station is now full of people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are not only a lot of police, but also a large number of well-dressed middle-class people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost all policemen are like the full-stitched gears, squeezing their feet to appease the elites of these cities<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My God! You can come!" Jack hurried from the outside and gasped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg asked: "What happened? I chased two ghouls far away yesterday, and suddenly I heard a huge explosion. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Su Ge said that he was not at the scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack went to the table and took a sip of water and said, "Nature is the aftereffect of last night. Although the action to annihilate the cult was very successful, the terrorist attack of the cult The plan is still realized. Now the north side of the farm is a mess. I heard that more than 60 people died in the explosion and fire. Although they are all tramps and foreigners, they still make these elites self-defeating. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
