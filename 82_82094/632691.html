			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the home of Bernice, Su Ge stood by the window and looked at the sunny sky outside, and a burst of warm heat rushed through the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the breath of summer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you going to do? Do you still stay?" Shelly asked, not far behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s eyes looked at the carriage on the street and said, “Well, I still have something to deal with.”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not afraid that they will find you? If there is no accident, they should be found through the things on board."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su The grid turned slightly and looked to somewhere in the northeast. The tone responded calmly: "They should be the news from the confession of the people. After all, instinctively, some inspirational people can hear my words at the time. "The bells."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As for Drake, Iyeta, Macock, these people did not say anything that should not be said."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So sure?" Shelly had some surprises. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug regained his gaze and turned and smiled: "Because if they say something, their people have blocked us here, not through astrology." To determine my location."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley gave a sigh and agreed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your hero has no movement yet, are you sure that the dirty bug can fulfill your expectations of him?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge put his hands behind his back and said, "I don't know how to play when he is working. How to end it, I still need to discuss with Green."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then two people are not talking, quietly enjoying the peace of mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half an hour, Su Ge opened his eyes and closed his eyes, and his mouth said with an accident: "How did he come?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ancient?" Shirley felt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug stood up: "There is that female warlock."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;叮叮......< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doorbell has rang during the conversation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Betty, who pruned flowers and plants in the corridor, ran to the front of the door: "Who are you looking for?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ancient feelings outside the door saw Betty glimpse, looked down at Betty's feet and said, "I am looking for Mr. Odin Assass."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Which one are you?" Betty asked with a hint of vigilance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Sug came over and said with a smile: "Let them come in, Gu Ju is my good friend."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh!" Betty squinted and squinted and handed two pairs of slippers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ancient look at Betty’s look and sigh: “It’s a little girl full of aura.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "What I said in my family, you have a good vision." Su Ge said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gu Jue said with pleasure: "It is my pleasure to have a similar vision with the Supreme."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "I am not a sage, you admit the wrong person." Shirley said faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ancient glimpse, then laughed: "The Sayādaw will really laugh, I saw you on a desert island more than a month ago, and taught." Hundreds of pirates."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Shirley’s brow furrowed and his tone gradually chilled. “I ended up saying it, it’s not me.” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge already knows who Guzhi was seeing at the time, so he whispered: "That is really not my fiancee."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ancient meditation for a moment, not talking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley glanced at Su Ge's face and turned to say to Yeta. "Bug, come upstairs with me. Since you are ready to admire under my hand, there are some things you need to know in advance." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iyeta, who was in a side battle, did not dare to violate, respectfully nodded with Sherry to go upstairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looked at the back of Shirley’s departure, and his heart was warm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shelly knows that he cares about Ada, which is an opportunity to ask him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the two ladies left, Su Ge and Gu Ju sat down and said seriously: "What you see is not my fiancée, but her Sister, Ada."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No?" Guju still has some unbelief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge sighed: "They are exactly the same, but you didn't feel the opposite temperament and style of the two of them?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"temperament and style? A person would have different temperament and style. They are obviously one person, benevolent, cold, dark, bright, evil, holy. They are all respected." Guyu insisted on his own ideas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug knows that this is different from some of his explanations, so he no longer struggles with this question and asks: "You said I saw Ada a month ago? A pirate on a desert island?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ancient sense nodded: "I just crossed the ocean and passed a distant island, ready to go up and find something to eat. I saw some pirate ships around, and a sacred atmosphere echoed throughout the island."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In my curiosity, I looked at it and found that the sages were dressed in white. The robes sit on the stone and there are hundreds of pirates in front of them. At this time, the pirates are pious and face-to-face, and they have been awakened by the sages to true goodness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Speaking, Gu Jue sighed: "The Sayādaw is the most beautiful person in the world, even more beautiful than the fairy I have ever seen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su After listening to my heart, at least Ada’s situation is very safe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In this case, should you be very clear? The kind and sacred sage and the savage and cruel existence of my family are completely opposite."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ancient sense of eccentricity Said: "The cruelty is also a sacred person, you are not mistaken?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What am I wrong?" Su Ge was mad laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gu Jue said: "The nature of the sacredness is sorrow and cruelty. I saw it very clearly, and the sages taught them to leave and leave. There is no human feelings in the middle, only the high indifference."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And with the departure of the sage, the abandoned pirates fell into a violent loss and Crazy, after hundreds of people committed suicide on the beach."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;! ! ! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Sugton’s eyes widened and his face was incredible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gu Jue continued: "The situation and the consequences of the Sacred are very clear, but she is still unmoved, even if the pirates cry and tragic pleading, she responded It’s just indifference. Isn’t this just haze and cruelty? After giving hope, letting it fall into despair, this is the most vicious and cruel way I have ever seen.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge calmed down the inner shock and asked Gu Jue: "You should have the ability to see through the essence, what do you see, and what do you see?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The ancient sense of reverence said: "A perfect and innocent saint."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "These things, is the saint to do?" Asked seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gu Jue corrected: "The saints are the existence of great achievements. They care about greatness, their own fruit, and have nothing to do with human beings. In their eyes No good, no evil, no black, no white, no life, no death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After hearing this, Su Ge was lost in thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is completely different from the sage he imagined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
