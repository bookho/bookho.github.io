			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The square in front of the Church of the Holy Blood, at this time, has been crowded with people, and a tall three-story platform has been set up in the middle of the place. There are seven women in white dresses dancing on them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arms swing, the waist and limbs sway, giving a very comfortable feeling from far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people stood by the crowd and looked at the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a beautiful dance! Although it’s so far away, it gives me a feeling of romance and beauty.” Su Ge said with amazement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ada smiled and his face was a little excited: "Right! She can be famous!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp This is the language of a series of alliance empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Ms. Elisa is an expert-rated dancer, her dance has the ability to appease people and evoke the magical power of good memories. It has a very obvious effect on appease those suffering and war sequelae."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear the language of this empire, Sug does not have to look back. Who is it: "Listen to the sound, you responded well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ada turned to look at it, just to see a white hair, with a black top hat, wearing The coat of the coat smiled and walked over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Long time no see, Mr. Bart. Your appearance has become more mature." Ada smiled and said hello. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart here’s acting with a blunt Beran language, and turned to look at Su Ge: “It’s not easy to see you.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge has no choice but to spread his hand: "No way, I am busy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the previous Fighting, the relationship between the two is already strong enough, and Bart does not talk nonsense directly to the topic: "I will leave tomorrow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So fast?" The eyebrows are picked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart smirked: "If it weren't for this injury, I'm afraid I would go back early, and the headquarters is mad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded, though Things are solved, but the ending is not complete. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s good to go back later. This time I owe you a big favor. Now I’m coming back.” Bart looked serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? How are you going to return?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remember the two years ago mentioned What about it?" Bart asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s face changed slightly and he laughed: “I found you more and more cute, Mr. Bart.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When two people chat, two mature women enthusiastically walked over to hold Ada in the middle, a happy smile, talking about each other's new clothes today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ada turned and said: "The three of us went on a stroll, you should have something to say to Mr. Bart, we will meet at home at noon." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good!" Su Ge nodded happily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ada is always intimate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After separation, two people left the crowd and walked on a quiet street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today's collective holiday, the road to Financial Street is surprisingly quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two walked side by side on a street full of snow, and Su Ge asked calmly: "Let's say! What happened two years ago." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart did not directly say, carefully look at Su Ge’s current dress and temperament, and admire: "However, in ten days, this change almost made me feel changed. Just like a person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge smiled slightly: "There is an old saying in the distant East, and the priests should be treated with enthusiasm for three days. I have been here for ten days. Is it not too much?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remote ancient country of the East? You know!?" Bart heard the face faintly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Su Ge’s heart jumped: “My day, this is a mouthful to say, is this world really there?”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the heart is very panicked, but Su Ge’s current acting skills have been in full swing, and he nodded lightly: “Slightly know one or two.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; After four words, Su Ge does not intend to say more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart did not ask much, whispered: "There is a rumor that there is an ancient country living in the mountains and clouds in the distant fog of the East, but from ancient times No one has found it yet, but instead has made the legend of the "Cloud Heaven" of the Glorious Church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough, this topic ends here, talk about two Years ago," Su Ge immediately said the topic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart returns to God, and the shock of converging his heart begins to start from the beginning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The things two years ago are more complicated, and the things involved are particularly wide. You have to be mentally prepared, don't be fooled."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassured, I am not the same today." Su Ge looked confident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bar features nodded and said: "The source of this matter should start from the bloody maze."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Cough, the bloody maze is 啥?" Su Ge feels hot face. Bart looked at him and explained: "The bloody maze is no secret in today's high-end mystery. The three churches are born out of Kabator. The Academy, but what really made them happen is because of the three dungeon labyrinths. The legendary three dungeon labyrinths contain ancient knowledge. After mastering the three labyrinths, the three churches began to rise rapidly. They were controlled by the Church of the Holy Blood. The maze is called the Holy Blood Maze."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge heard a blank face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart continues: "At the time, the Assassin Alliance sent a message that a maze guard escaped from the maze and fled to Bain City after being chased by many forces." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For a time, Bain City has become the focus of the mysterious world. The Cold Church, the Institute of Polar Studies, the Sisters of the Warlocks, the Assassin League, I don’t know in detail, and there are also plateaus The Twin Alliances of the Land; the Glorious Church from the Western Continent; the Ghost Fleet from Vikula; the Longyan Believers in the North Winds; the Wolf Blood Legion on the Abyss Boundary; the Vampire in the Bloody Sanctuary; The eternal bereaved; the knight of the nameless old king in the land of sorrow and evil; the law enforcer who does not fall to the fortress; the descendant of the god of the skull of the ancient god; even the hunter of the horror of the legendary city of disasters appears here."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s eyes kept moving and his head could not turn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just Bart said a total of ten new forces. He only knows four: the Twin Alliance, the Glorious Church, the Bloody Holy Pool, the Wolf Blood Legion. Others have never heard of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart looked at the sturdy Su Ge smiled: "I guess you should have done a lot of work in the past few days to read a lot of books. But there are relatively basic contents. I said that these organizations are not well known to the public and belong to the more secretive high-end organizations."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Coughing and chopping, the topic of conversion: Q: "So many organizations are gathered here, the church is not in control?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart continues: "Of course, You have to be clear that the relationship between the three churches is not as good as it seems on the surface. They want to steal the opposite knowledge and technology from each other, and even smash each other and dig the opposite corner. So the night eagle and the cure two In fact, the church is secretly chasing the guard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge said with a strange look: "So many people gathered here did not blow up the entire city. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart sighed: "It almost fell flat, when the Church of the Holy Blood was here." The mysterious man who almost completely destroyed, people killed or injured other organizations also many "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;".? That was how calm the "Scottish asked, curious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart’s face solemnly said: “This incident completely angered the Church of the Holy Blood and sent a veteran with a sickle. After coming here, one night Most of the foreigners were slaughtered between them, and only a few survivors fled."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
