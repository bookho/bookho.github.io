The dark couples were even more shocked at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The form of the secret treasure is diverse, mostly formed by innate, with mysterious power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the weapon in Su Ge’s hand is obviously not like a traditional secret treasure, but more like a mysterious costume that is considered to be processed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the weapon is too magical and powerful compared to the mysterious costume. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Umbrella, long sword, chain sword, this form of change has gone far beyond the change of mechanical properties, the kind of change, like silky The slippery deformation is so smooth, without any mechanical sensation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is that weapon?" Many people, including Albert, have been deeply curious about this weapon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moss hurriedly wrote down the morphological function of the entire weapon, and carefully wrote his own comment: "From the situation, this is a powerful The mystery of the means of attack and the ability to fight, the four colleges invited him to make up for the problem of the level of combat in the college. This equipment and body are very horrible, and must not be close,"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attitude of the class at this time is a bit crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Too great! This...this is completely out of the hierarchy with the mystery I know!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp The mysterious person he knows does not have many means of direct attack. He can only sneak through the mysterious knowledge, curse, and carry out a very complicated and dangerous game. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in the face of the monsters of the Kraken, it is rarely a physical collision, mostly using his own less aggressive knowledge, difficult resistance . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in March, the church’s gods and hunters, who are known for their physical battles, rely on mysterious attacks, materials and means to make them cumbersome and complicated. The means to fight with the monsters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one has ever had such a clean and sinister means, even an art-like sword, to slaughter those powerful monsters with a horrible efficiency! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, Su Ge’s action has refreshed his perception of the mystery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is the weapon of that weapon?" Macock couldn't see the monster, but he clearly saw the weapon of Sugna. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whip with hundreds of sharp edges is wrapped around the body, which is comparable to putting a person into a meat grinder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just seeing the swaying weapon, Macock’s heart was a little trembling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because this weapon is really scary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ban mutter said: "I can't see it, I don't even know if this weapon is a secret treasure, or a mysterious costume."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side, Iyeta said with a sigh of uneasiness: "I would like to thank these Krakens. This guy is actually a master swordsman. He doesn't even show himself now. Any knowledge of it is so easy to kill five Krakens with its own swordsmanship and control over the body. This is simply incredible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The mysterious profession of physical combat, including the fighters, swordsmen, etc., these occupations are not only able to improve by their own body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every professional will be exposed to a great deal of knowledge. After fully mastering the body, these people will find their own knowledge through their powerful body. Incorporate into your own system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Occupation is just a tool to keep people focused, not a shackle that hinders people's vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert saw that the wrist was a little trembling, because the strength and horror of Su Ge was far beyond his imagination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge can now say that it has completely broken the conventional mysterious career system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because his knowledge system is completely beyond the standards of all mysterious professions, he now has a lot of knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This person will definitely be an opportunity for us to thoroughly ask the church in March." Albert is very excited inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When people are still stunned in shock, Su Ge holds a long sword, like a peerless swordsman in the novel, with Shirley walking from the stern The bow of the ship killed more than a dozen Krakens in a row. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The styles of these pirates are very similar, there are almost no wounds on the body, and a sword breaks his head and dies completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, all the dead Krakens did not make any sound, and almost one face was directly killed by Su Ge’s horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the rain, Sug licked his arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All the way to his arm is a bit sour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, the high-intensity sniper is very heavy on the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, he changed his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Human body is still too weak." Shirley said faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge has a wrist: "If it’s Andrew, it should be very easy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snow Lill did not answer and continued: "You didn't find out, your spirit is breaking through the limits of humanity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is silent, nodding his head and agreeing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After drinking the occupational pharmacy, Su Ge used the Great God's Declaration to pierce those restrictions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result is that he has access to a wider range of knowledge without any restrictions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The danger is that you can go crazy at any time because you are exposed to too much incomprehensible knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Sug has a body of God, and the knowledge that has been solved through the body of God is as instinct for Su Ge, and it can be fully integrated overnight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But this has little effect." Su Ge said, went to the bow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, he saw the last twelve remaining Krakens. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These Krakens all have simple weapons, strong and scary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leading Kraken is a giant with a three-meter-high, sacral spine on his back and a skull helmet on his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Kraken is like a mountain king sitting in the bow, just like this ship is theirs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Human, you are infected with the blood of many of our people." The Kraken leader actually made a human voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although some are blunt, Su Ge still understands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug came out with an umbrella, and a lot of rain fell down the umbrella, like a water curtain that would block Su Ge’s face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The iron umbrella lifted up slightly, and the dark eyes of Suge looked at the Kraken leader through the water curtain: "This ship is my toy, I will give it to you." A suggestion, leave now, so that you can save your life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear this, the Kraken leader stands up and is full of fangs. The mouth is open: "Human, you are looking for death. The next race is really arrogant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, stand up completely and the body disappears instantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge certainly knows that he is not disappearing, his body is only integrated into the rain, the speed is extremely fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly a muffled sound came from behind Su Ge, the body of the Kraken’s head condensed in the back of Su Ge, and the punch of the Soviet Union’s master clock The protection is broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at the same time, he was stepped back by the high-frequency shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment when Su Ge had just turned back, his big body was once again integrated into the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second appears directly in front of Su Ge five meters away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faint can feel that its big left fist is a little trembling at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter how strong your defense is, how strong armor can't defend against the transmission of vibration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As long as the vibration can be transmitted, Suger’s attack will follow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you feel?" Su Ge asked with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Kraken leader is naturally not stupid, immediately waved his hand: "kill him!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp He needs the younger brother to come and explore the details of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well! Two or three simultaneous attacks are OK, and these dozens of attacks at the same time, this degree of danger is a geometric increase!" This is anxious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others are very calm compared to the class, and others are looking forward to what Su Ge’s knowledge is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This side Su Ge faces more than a dozen sirens at the same time attack, with a wave of hands, the sword will be back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The little bugs seem to be waiting to see what my knowledge of being a swordsman is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Shirley said faintly: "I remember that your setting is a hypnotist."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s body is stretched and arched, smirking: "Of course, but I would like to show some false information to the bugs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, the sword of the counter-grip slammed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗡嗡嗡嗡...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The harsh swordsman sounded abruptly, and then some subsided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
