			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the banquet hall, Oliver took Jean and the two nobles with higher status, and walked calmly, first to the Vanas. Then I said seriously: "Your Majesty, I just heard you say that we have collusion between the Duke of the Mountain and the sect of death, and also controlled the Prince of Jean with witchcraft. I think this is a great humiliation for the Duke of our mountains."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he finished, he looked around and raised his voice and said loudly: "We didn't really want to announce this thing. After all, it would affect the reputation of the Guinness royal family. But I heard that His Majesty is so upside down, we can’t continue to let it go.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, the surrounding nobles suddenly raised their ears and they could hear it. Oliver holds very good evidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The plague of the werewolf was spread out by Jean. This is what we all know, so let our Prince Prince personally say the reason for this!" Oliver said to let go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, everyone’s eyes fell on Prince Jean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prince of Jean, who stepped forward, made some hoarse and low voices: "In fact, the whole story of this matter is my sister, Vanas Guinness. Instructing me to do this, she wants to inherit the throne, and let me become like this to kill my father, then I am afraid to escape, she sent a werewolf to attack me, I was attacked by the werewolf and became a werewolf, after the introduction Things, and when I was about to be killed, Mr. Finn and the Duke of the Mountain saved me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哗! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, everyone was shocked, his face was full of horror, and he turned his head and locked Vanas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment Vanas is still calm, but deep sorrow and anger can be seen in the depths of his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty! Is this true??" All the nobles stared at Vanas, and some people were pale and questioned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas took a deep breath and replied in a cold voice: "A nonsense."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;Oliver squinted after listening: "Then, for the testimony of the younger brother, please give evidence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanaston was in silence, now In the case of this allegation, she was unable to produce any valid evidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a time, the entire hall was suffocating to death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of those who have just shown their loyalty are getting paler over time and then getting angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as they were about to erupt, a voice suddenly sounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is the evidence? It’s just that I have it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear this voice, everyone’s The eyes looked down at the sound and locked in the body of Su Ge standing in the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I remember that you are the Queen's entourage? Do you have any evidence?" Although Su Ge's presence is not high, these people still barely have some impressions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oliver stared at Su Ge and said with a smile: "So what evidence can you come up with this entourage?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge came forward with a smile and said with open arms: "Please let me introduce myself, I am not a servant of Her Majesty."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, he took his own token from his arms: "I am the trainee bishop of the Church of the Holy Blood, Suger Sotos."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sacred Blood Church!? Trainee Bishop!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this identity, everyone suddenly glimpsed, then hurriedly fell in the eyes On the token in the hands of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exquisite blood-relief of the Holy Blood, the special craftsmanship, and the unique atmosphere of the Church of the Holy Blood, these well-known nobles recognize it at a glance This token is true. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Our Guinness Kingdom has always been inconsistent with the Church of the Holy Blood. What are you doing here?" The nobles around Oliver whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge smiled and looked at Oliver and said, "This is still asking Mr. Finn."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, everyone’s eyes fell on the Olympics. Lee Buddha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oliver’s face was a bit stiff at this time, squinting and asking: “What does it have to do with me?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp Su Ge stepped forward and replied: "About a few months ago, the city of Bain, the northeastern province of the Berant Empire, annihilated a cult group called the Death Sect, but the personnel were intricate, although the annihilation was very Quickly, but still let a small number of disabled parties escape. According to the confession of the arrested person, among the people who escaped, there is their leader."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge laughed: "And coincidentally, their lord is called Oliver Finn."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;! ! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aristocrats heard this head some reaction, but this series of flips is too fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oliver said faintly: "There are many people with the same name, what does it have to do with me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Suge said: "According to his students, Pamela said that Oliver Finn escaped to the Kingdom of Guinness. And while he fled to the Kingdom of Guinness, this side It caused civil strife. Although the church will not interfere in the internal affairs of the Guinness country, it is incumbent on the recovery of the cult embers, so I came here to conduct a profound investigation, and I have seized the bottom personnel of the death sect, John. He seized the bishop of the death sect, Hayden. According to these two confessions, they all pointed out that you are the leader of the death sect, and you intend to turn all the people of the whole country into werewolves through the plague of the werewolf!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear this, all the people present at the scene jump, even if they are standing on the side of the mountain duke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They don’t know the true identity and purpose of Oliver, they just think that he is a red man next to the Duke of the Mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John and Hayden all know each other, and these two people did disappear in these two days! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oliver said faintly: "Whoever says, can you come up with any evidence?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sughaha smiled: "The evidence is in front of you!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Su Ge came forward and came to Prince Jean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you doing!? Is the prince close to you?" Immediately, a mysterious man stepped forward and blocked him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge said faintly: "Let's go, I have something to confirm with His Royal Highness Prince."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "You don't have this qualification?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shut up! The low-lying man!" Vanas suddenly shouted loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Bishop Sotos is my guest, or a trainee bishop of the Church of the Holy Blood. Is there any qualification for him that you can decide!?" There is momentum and oppression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The explosiveness and oppression of this superiority made the professional mystery suddenly breathe and his face pale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let it go, let him ask." Oliver seems to be confident in his own means. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mystery listened to the respectful retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is solemn and asks loudly: "Prince Jean, now I can protect the safety of you and your sister, don't be afraid of any threats and Fear, tell me who is turning you into this sluggish appearance, who is secretly controlling you, who is turning you into a werewolf, letting you spread the plague!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the passage of the voice, Suger’s thick bells suddenly sounded and played on Jean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, Jean’s sluggish gaze restored some of the light, then suddenly turned back and pointed at Oliver’s aunt: “It’s him! He turned me into Monster! It is he who controls me to kill my father! It is him! Everything is him! This damn demon, Oliver Finn!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
