			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night wind blew gently, blowing the clothes of Su Ge and the smooth hair of Lobo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms. Mei did not give up, and the group had already dispersed to surround Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, these mysterious people each hold some silver metal balls in their hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These metal balls have a special connection with each other. At this time, there is a faint form of quirky rune that completely surrounds Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms. Mei’s posture is still elegant. She slowly put away her handkerchief and asked indifferently: “Do you really think that I have no other means? Su Ge Soto Si, if you are really coming, don't leave from here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug holding a cane, the eyes under the mask look around, calm "Do you think that you can stop me with these small shrimps?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can try." Ms. Mei said provocatively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A thick night clock spreads out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, Su Ge clearly felt that he was not around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a mysterious thread that is completely invisible between the metal balls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These threads have a strong mysterious cut that completely cuts through the complete mystery, making it impossible to do so. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment these threads have completely surrounded the circumference of Su Ge’s body, with these dozens of people as the central node, forming a cage for the suppression of Su Ge’s actions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The cage of silver shadow?" Su Ge brows a pick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a legendary bishop of the church, and I know a lot." Ms. Mei said slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cage of silver shadow is a special law array developed by the church through the blood of the Holy Blood to block the movement of the mysterious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the complete isolation of mysterious materials and the mysterious silver with a strong mysterious resonance, with the psionic power and knowledge of at least twelve mysteries, you can A cage of regular dodecahedrons of varying sizes was formed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a large number of cutting psionic threads in the cage that not only limit the action, but also isolate most of the mysterious spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This silver shadow cage has also become a mysterious person: dead cage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many years, the Church of the Holy Blood has dealt with this mystery by knowing how many mysteries are known. This spell has a very loud name throughout the mysterious world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's reach out and touch the air in front of one's chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inspiration of the soul clearly feels that there is a deadly thread here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the feedback that the night vibration was cut off, at this time three people were like being wrapped in the middle of countless spiders, and they could not move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silk lines that are devastating to mystery have been unconsciously placed within a distance of less than one meter from their body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you waiting for the support of the Church of the Holy Blood?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Su Ge’s voice is still stable, and it seems that he has not noticed that he is in a desperate situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms. Mei chuckled: "Of course, catch you, but you can do great things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Su Ge took a deep breath and said, "There is a weakness in all the tactics. The weakness of the silver shadow cage is in the twelve people who are nodes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "So, do you have the knowledge to attack them through this thread?" Ms. Mei was mocked in her tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calling...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Su Ge spit out a long breath: "The Holy Blood Church, did you tell me about my knowledge?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, calm and calm The lady’s heart leaps slightly and the tone is plain. “It’s just a knowledge of shock and death.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Blood Church did not give her too much about Su Ge Knowledge and means. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before this, Suger Sotos was a fan of her cognition, and even a mystery in the whole mystery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! Boom! Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, a burst of bells and bells from the body of Su Ge quickly spread around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Useless, any mystery can't break through the blockade of the silver shadow cage." Ms. Mei's tone is very firm, she knows that this is beyond the limits of human thinking. How powerful the spell has. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other mysterious people around him are smirking at this moment, as if they are watching a fool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not far from the roof, Black Pharaoh sat alone, his dark eyes looked at Su Ge, and finally his eyes fell on the side of the second ha . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is indeed his servant, but... is it He?" The black Pharaoh frowned at the moment and fell into deep meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the ground, the thick night clock spreads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the passage of the bell, these people did not feel anything special. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the bells that are delivered are just ordinary sounds, there is no mystery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bluffs!" A mysterious person with a rough face laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms. Mei stared at Su Ge cautiously, and her inspiration told herself that something seemed to be coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bells accompanied by Su Ge’s breath and spread. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, under the gaze of the crowd, countless blue mists rose in the body of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a moment, a huge robe, four huge wings, a low hood appeared on the body of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A death, coming to earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What the hell is this!" Seeing this scene, all mysterious people tightened their eyes and slammed, and the vision rose three points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pair of eyes burning with ghosts and ghosts slowly burn under the hood, can see, Su Ge's body of death is more real than before, More powerful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether it’s the robe on the body or the wings behind it, it’s like real existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, on the robes full of clouds, the clouds gradually receded, and the ghosts and cheekbones in the fog gradually became prominent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this existence, Ms. Mei’s body instinctively took a step back, and her eyes tightened like nails, full of incredible look at Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This... How is it possible? Humans... How can humans reach this level!?" Ms. Mei was full and her voice was full of shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large number of black feathers descend from the sky, and the horrible death of the horrible sweeps across the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clerics and mysters around them face this situation, and their faces are instantly pale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feathers in the sky, each piece is a condensation of death knowledge, and each piece represents death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These feathers have gone beyond the ordinary mystical concept, for some reason they can't understand, have a trace of divinity! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can clearly see that the understatement of the feathers in the process of cutting off the silver shadow cage they are proud of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
