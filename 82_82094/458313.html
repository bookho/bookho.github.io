			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, there are six mysteries including Moore and Serena, and twelve ordinary people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time everyone’s eyes are gathered on Su Ge, and they are not afraid to breathe, watching quietly like a statue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge helped his black dome hat, exposed the silver badge that crossed the long gun and the night bell, and took the cane and walked calmly In the middle of the hall, the calm voice is like a chilly night wind: "A group of mysterious people have no waste!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four mysteries are very Calm, temperament is arrogant. I looked at Su Ge deeply and didn't speak, but I didn't mean to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moore said to the middle-aged man near his side: "Mr. Morris."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Mr. Morris, who has a white beard and looks ordinary, took a look at the red metal ball in the hands of Su Ge and nodded slightly: "Find it, you can discuss it later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Then, the last four remaining people left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone can come out! Mystery has left! Everyone is safe now!" At this time, Serena softly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can see that she is still very concerned about ordinary people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this voice, the rest of the ordinary people gathered in a sluggish manner, and the line of sight still fell on Su Ge, and could not move for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you..." Judy walked over and whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge turned slightly and glanced at her, calmly saying: "After all, classmates."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp After that, he turned and walked over to Moore: "I am here to give you, there are some fish that slip through the net. It seems that there are still some cultists who are going to rob the fire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Moore tempted to ask: "Can the spirit keep up?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge smiled lightly: "The legendary word, not everyone can afford it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, leave everyone with a tall and elegant back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judy looked at the back, stepped forward several times, but couldn’t speak, and looked down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this the legendary bishop, Suger Sotos?" A surviving old man heard this stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, everyone suddenly returned to God and whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selina whispered, "How is the captain?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moore is silent : "Master below, invincible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"!!?" Serena's eyes wide open, incredible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moore’s eyes flashed with radiance: “He bears some kind of sacred mark and has far more psionic power than you and me. From the knowledge of the past, It can be confirmed that this guy holds a secret profession, and it is a very rare high-grade goods. The bells, the offense and defense, and the death knowledge, also carry the death knowledge, you say?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selina slowly squeezed her palms, and her mind was full of complexity and she couldn’t speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I have determined one thing from this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He stayed in the Church of the Holy Blood for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why can you see it?" Serena One shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moore whispered: "When he puts on his hat, he reveals that special sign, which should symbolize his current strength field. Since it is declared here This sign means that he has no interest in his position in the church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is..." Serena eyes lit up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, there is the possibility of cooperation!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Outside the manor, the wind in the late autumn is very cold, with a floating yellow leaf full of sorrow and loneliness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge calmly came out, his dark eyes swept around, a sneer in his mouth, and he took out a small bottle and poured it into his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the night, there are more than a dozen mysterious people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These people are all kinds of clothes, including even ghouls, demon spirits and servants of the genius and monsters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Leave the blood sacrifices, let us spare you!" A baker wearing a bib was standing in the middle of the road, threatening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪嗒! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg didn’t seem to hear that the dark leather shoes stepped on the slate and took a step forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Invisible to see, Su Ge skin began to creep slowly, there seems to be something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are jealous!?" The baker frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, the second step. Su Ge's dark pupil was first contracted, then enlarged, and after a few times it became a dragon-like erect, with a heavy sense of oppression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I really thought you were a bishop, I wouldn’t dare to kill you!?" The baker was on the verge of a pale human hand, and a burst of mysterious waves erupted. It should be a secret treasure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third step, the dark blood vessels climbed into the white face of Su Ge's neck like a tentacle, and looked very strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inferior dragon potion, the body and the psionics simultaneously doubled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, Yuehua illuminates Su Ge’s weird side face, because the potion turns into dark lips with white teeth, making this smile look unspeakable Surprising. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have too many words." Su Ge heard some hoarse voices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another cold night wind blew, and a yellow leaf fell on Su Ge's brim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with the yellow leaves falling, it is the dark feathers that are hard to see in the night sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you heard it? The late bell is calling for the name of the 汝."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......... ...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is still quiet, in the grass, the mysterious people who are hidden in it are wide-eyed, and the body is constantly shaking, as if they have seen the most horrible things in this life. The stiff body does not even have the courage to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several mysterious people can’t stand it, completely abandoning reason, praying to forget the indescribable fear in this way, screaming in his mouth, running out crazy . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In silence, these mysterious people are either shot through their heads, or are suspended by a lasso on a tree, or directly by a thin line. Live your neck and die directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss, who was holding the pipe, walked out calmly and threw the bodies into the ditch not far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are eight cult corpses, four ghouls, three demon spirits, and twelve human face rats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The combat power of the Demon Hunter can only be considered moderate among all mysteries, but no one can compare you to the efficiency of killing and killing monsters." Emilia did not know when it appeared, calmly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss is still cold, with the unique hoarse voice saying: "There is a specialization in the industry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Stop and ask: "How?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emilia turned to look at the road not far away and didn’t know what died because of what A dozen mysterious people, as well as the black feathers still falling, with a shock in the depths: "It is far beyond my expectations."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are your plans?" Gerlos slammed his fingers and Mars lit the pipe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emilia smiled a little: "Wait."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerousus spits out Smoke: "Well, wait."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Emilia glanced at Gerlos and asked: "I am curious, why are you not being affected? The influence of the Holy Grail of the Soul?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Possibly, their blood level is not enough." Gerlos spit out a cigarette and said slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Emilia nodded slightly, the ethereal voice with a hint of exclamation: "Yeah, who can think of the most pure blood of Byron the Great, not going Be an emperor, hiding in the church as a demon hunter?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerousus’s golden erect glanced at Emilia and asked: "That Who knows that the blood of the pure Aries is not the blood of the sheep, but the blood of the dragon?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, the two people looked at each other in a tit-for-tat manner After a while, I will stop talking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other side, Su Ge’s wrist slammed, blood was sprayed in the night sky, and the chain sword hanged a very confident fighter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the blood and minced meat above, Su Ge stood in the middle of the intersection, looking around like a mountain, where at least twenty mysterious bodies had fallen. on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strength of these mysterious people is not too strong, generally a profession, and the experts are less pitiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for why? These people thought that Su Geling could be exhausted and ready to come and leak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, they are faced with a more horrible Su Ge than in the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug knows that there are people who are crouching in the dark, and the attraction of the five-level secret treasure cannot be described. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Su Ge didn't care about it. He looked up slightly and looked at the darkness with pride. He was full of confidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Finally, I can stand here and stand out from the crowd! Finally, I can also take the prestige and start the knife! Finally, I am no longer a life like a thin paper."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Taking a deep breath, holding the cane in front of his hands and looking at the body that walked all the way to him, the heart was stirring, and the darkness of the scorpion sparkled like a star. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, he has a proud capital. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not far away, Julie paled and clenched her fists, watching the tall and mighty figure under the moonlight, and could not help but tremble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The performance of Su Ge has gone far beyond her imagination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sug Sotos, must re-rate! Either hold it in your hand, or don't provoke it!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, she quickly left her face, and she didn't even dare to imagine killing him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dark night, a black robes, dark, waterfall-like long hair fluttering in the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stood in the air in the air, as if she was with the night, could not see the appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes! Good! Keep this momentum and go to the ancient city!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The body turned into a darkness and disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge’s gaze is like a dragon, like a dragon looking at a shadow of black, calmly saying: "Come out."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within a radius of 50 meters, the mysterious people of the cats and dogs have now feared the strength of Su Ge and quickly fled, leaving only a few people still standing there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bishop Sotos!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the shadow, out of four men and women in dresses, It was just four people in the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
