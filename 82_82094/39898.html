			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s line of sight did not stay too much on this, but quickly found the soul that was completely shivering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This soul has even shown signs of dissipating for some reason, very weak and unstable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an experience of Su Ge light car familiar road to lead the soul into his arms, through the nourishment of his own psionic, soothing, let it open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My child, who bullied you? Will you be imprisoned here?" Su Ge asked softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul trembled and replied: "It is my teacher, the sect of the death sect, Oliver Finn."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He...he said that the death church has been unable to develop here, he needs to change a place. But let those police Paying the price. He said that he will return, let me wait for him here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul is the same as the previous Chuck, completely unconscious that he has been Kill your own mentor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where are the rest of the death church going?" Su Ge continued to ask softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul whispered: "They have left here under the leadership of my teacher, we have found a new partner. The teacher said that after he saved enough power, he I will once again come to this city and give me the supreme glory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Su Ge slowly squeezed his fist: "You know where they are going." "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know." The soul swayed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If he wants revenge, why not directly detonate? Instead, guide us here?" Su Ge continued to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul whispers: "The teacher said that direct explosion is a rude act of terrorists. We are purifying the world, even if it is revenge." ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...this old thing has a pit in his head!" Su Ge snorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After asking some core questions, Su Ge sent his superb prayers to his own ice warship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Su Ge did not cry because he learned to restrain and adapt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just getting ready to stand up from the ground, but found a folded letter in the crack of the closet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After confirming that there is no mysterious effect, Su Ge will take the letter and open it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is not much content. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dear Gerlos, hello. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope this note will be found in the ruins and contaminated with the blood of those policemen. Otherwise, the plan to use the body of my lovely student to attract the police can be wasted. However, it is not excluded that you will see this letter in this crack. If you see it, congratulations, you will win this contest. But you have to be careful! One day in the future, death will come again – your old friend, Oliver. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See, Su Ge did not know what to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the letter out of the room, Su Ge handed the letter to Gerlos, and also said the dialogue of the soul in detail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can actually communicate with the soul!?" Marx and Bobby were a little surprised when they heard what Sug said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge stunned and said: "Communication with the soul is not the most basic ability of the priest?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp On the side, Rogan looked at Jellos with a strange look: "How did you teach this child?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss will read the letter Put it out: "He has just become a priest for three days, and he has already done two big cases. I am very busy here and have no time to teach him. Now you know the situation in Bain."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge asked with some guilty conscience: "Is there any problem?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogen said with a sigh of relief: "The priest can indeed appease the soul and purify the grievances. The salvation is free. But among them, the gods and the soul are unable to communicate anyway. This is not a question of realm. But the profession of the priest is not involved in this knowledge and ability."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge listened to a glimpse, then suddenly remembered, there is really no such ability in the official. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ability is extracted from the night clock at the top of the temple, and it is already in existence before becoming a priest! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marx explained: "A profession that can generally hear the ability of the soul is a psychic, or a necromancer, or a musician."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge scratched his head and asked, "What am I supposed to be?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's a gift! There are a lot of people who can see something that shouldn't be seen, and hear the sound that shouldn't be heard. This is nothing special. You don't have any psychological burden," Gerlos explained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded and did not ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jeros’s statement he agrees. After all, in the myth of Cthulhu, there are often musicians, painters and the like who can hear the evil spirits. Whisper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerlos said here: "I have had several hands with Oliver Finn, at least the master-level hunter, a very tricky The madman. But he doesn't seem to know that we have the thing of Su Ge. The letter and the words of the soul are worthy of believing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogen nodded: "I also In this way, although some are not reconciled, at least the death sects are temporarily coming to an end in Bain City."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerousus nodded and picked up his pocket watch Looked, I found that the time is almost eleven o'clock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sug, you performed very well this time, then you can go home and rest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Su Ge, who was already very hungry and exhausted, was stunned and did not have any resignation. He readily agreed to leave after the ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Su Ge returned home, she found that the living room was still lit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Winnie and Black wore cotton pajamas sitting on the sofa by the fireplace and looking at the book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I saw Sug’s tired face, I rushed over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Brother, are you okay?" Black asked with concern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge waved his hand and said, "Nothing, it’s that the head is too expensive, plus no dinner, some dizzy."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I warm up my dinner!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scene at this time is like the scene that Su Ge just returned a few days ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this Su Ge is a bit embarrassing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last time such a scene, his entire life is still shrouded in the shadow of fear and worry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, the death sect has been evacuated from the city, at least it is safe for himself and his family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In this time, I want to become stronger as soon as possible and save my strength." Su Ge made up his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dinner is ready soon, today in bread and mashed potatoes, Su Ge also saw sausages and bacon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What day is it today?" Su Ge was surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wennie held her chin and said with a hint of pride on her face: "You are really handsome today. To celebrate, we decided to add meals privately. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black smiled and said, "Come on, it will be bad if it cools."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is very clear about the conditions at home now, this sausage and bacon is estimated to be the private money saved by two people working. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
