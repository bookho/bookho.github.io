			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then can't be a gentleman, then I have a mysterious culture of children since childhood?" Su Ge remembered what three-year-old refining body in the novels he saw. At the age of six, I can raise a few hundred pounds like a ten-year-old, and I will be a small genius in my teens. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To gain a strong power, cultivation from an early age is the foundation of the foundation. This is the perception of Su Ge instinct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mill sneered: "If you want your child to go crazy, let him go into mystery as soon as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge heard a glimpse, then remembered that the world has a spiritual presence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The mentality of the juvenile is not mature, even if the growth of a little vision can make the child fall into the madness of forever, can’t come back. Some people even think they are When the child is still in the child, he introduces the mystery and lets him see all kinds of distorted monsters, hoping to make the children think that these distorted monsters are the normal state, thus increasing the inner tolerance and will."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mill said with a sneer: "Do you know what the result is?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug shakes his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The result is that when the child is one and a half years old, the spirit is greatly distorted and becomes a monster form. Then in the dream, the parents' soul is eaten. It’s gone.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Su Ge couldn’t help but tremble. This kind of thing is scary when you think about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So you will find that the vast majority of people who are really in mysterious and in contact with those monsters are above the age of twenty."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg recalls that the mysterious people he met all the way were older than themselves, and the age of 30 was almost the average age. There was no such thing as the novel mentioned in the novel. genius. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It may also be for this reason that the more powerful people are, the more they are eager for their own children." Mil pulled the topic back at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge indulged and asked: "Is this the reason why the first child of each generation of the Guinness family will marry early?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know!?" Mill stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just told me to tell me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mill sighed and nodded: "Yes This is the price. At the time, under the auspices of the Church of the Holy Blood, the Guinness family and the god of death signed a contract, and their death curse was removed, or covered. Because of a stronger curse, from death The curse of God has appeared."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This curse is also a contract, deeply fixed in the blood of this family. The Guinness family is going to offer the birth of each generation. A child treats the god of death as a “child.” The curse of the child’s body will completely erupt, and through the connection of the curse, the power of the god of death will be transmitted to the baby. However, for many years, all failed.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the baby unbearable?" Su Ge asked curiously.米尔 shakes his head and shook his head: "No, the baby has withstood it, and even has some deified features. It can be said that the Son of God has been born successfully, but in the end it is Inexplicable death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge heard this brow lock, in the face of this situation, he could not figure out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the concept of this god of death? The Lord of my faith also has the relevant power of death. What is the relationship between the two?" Ask curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mill explained: "There are many kinds of gods. You should have heard about the legend of the god of death. He was evolved from human beings and died. The relevant knowledge is the channel, witnessing the source of knowledge, and the existence of the roots of the world. This god, our mysterious person calls it the great god, He is the target of all mysterious people, and is the proof of the limits of humanity."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is also a kind of god known as the ancient god, who are the original gods born in this world, the present and source of the original rules of the whole world. For example, the goddess of March "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The other is called the god. These gods can be understood as invading the world from outside the astrology, more typical It is the king of the ghoul who cherishes the church belief: Mordikian."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The last one is a false god. They are not real gods. They are powerful things that people have made through certain rituals. Although they are not gods, they have the incomparable power and the four principles of the gods. One of the beliefs of the Institute of Polar Studies is the artificial god known as the “recoverer.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing this Sugerton, I learned some knowledge. A deeper understanding of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mill leans on the chair: "The god of death in this land is not a true deity, but a dislike, mind, and the like. Things can't be seen, can't be condensed, can't be invisible, but they are invisible, but they exist. I guess the true purpose of the death sects is to replace the curse of the god of death by the replacement of the curse, and to present his power for capture. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The curse can be replaced?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, but there must be enough media and power. The curse of replacing the gods is more of a conceptual shift, which is what you mentioned before. The reason they want to plant the werewolf here. Covering the curse of the werewolf in the entire country, through the concept of the state on the blood of the royal family, this is a conceptual coverage. Finally through the key media, such as Vanas With a sacrificial ritual, you can put the curse of the werewolf into the blood of the royal family, and let the curse of the gods be attached by some suitable attachment objects. It is fine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Su Ge sighed and said: "It seems that I can't rely on the power of this god of death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You should better think about this kind of thing. "Mir is a warning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To reach that level, their logic of thinking is completely different from ours. What we like may be what they hate, and we fear and fear." Of course, it may be the most common for them. Often the mysterious people who try to summon and use the power of the gods are very miserable, and they all die before their enemies."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug recalls the logic of thinking in his body and sighs: "Understand, I have a deep understanding."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"?! Have you tried it??" Mill heard a look of surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
