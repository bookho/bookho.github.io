			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are waiting here," said Hills, standing on the edge of a wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vignia on the side asked curiously: "What did you hear? The blood axe lord is still waiting for our treatment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hiss mysterious smile: "Nature is our savior, the Pope is down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just, Hill When she heard the special bell of the Pope, she relied on her own storm to mark the moment, and she immediately sensed the position of the Pope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope gave her some orders through the bell, let her wait here, and then let Vigania play. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vignia still wants to talk, but he is stunned by Hills: "Listen!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the other side of the wall came a conversation between Su Ge and John. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s the Pope’s sorrow, this acting is almost making me feel real!” Hills’s heart was admired, and he secretly record. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because this kind of acting is a good umbrella for playing pigs and tigers in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Virginia is not very clear, he whispered in the ear of Hills: "This bag is your Pope's majesty? Impossible. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hills glanced at her and whispered: "The Pope’s knowledge and ability are beyond your imagination. He is acting, showing the enemy. Let the other party take it lightly. When the Pope screams, you directly break the wall and drive the two people away. The Pope wants to catch the big man behind them."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Virginia was surprised to hear the look and muttered: "This is acting? Deceptive!?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that moment, there was a sudden scream of Su Ge’s panic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hills took a shot of Vigania’s armor, and said: “The noble gods and wandering messengers, it’s time to show the majesty of the Holy Sword!” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon hearing this, Vegginia immediately became refreshed and pulled out the sword behind her sword to break the wall...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fat middle-aged and John cautious Looking at the whole body covered with armor, Vegginia, the last eye fell on the big sword that can easily break half a wall, cautiously back two steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are the person of the Glorious Church!?" The middle-aged people were very knowledgeable and saw the style of Vegniya's clothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard the glorious church, Vegginia was silent, and the eyes blocked by the triangular mask were gloomy, and the big sword in her hand was waved like a hemp. Staring at the middle-aged humanity: "Fat pig, you should not mention this name in front of me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, Vegniya’s body rushed to two personal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is very fast, and John is not responding quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the fat middle-aged man has some skills, pulls John's back collar back, and picks up a bright red thing to throw forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A closer look, it is actually a whole body red blood, the heart of some animal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vignia saw a whisper: "The damn necromancer!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Immediately, the body turned away from the sacred god, and the lightly grabbed Su Ge quickly left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man did not throw out the still beating heart, his face was rather ugly: "Damn, how come this madman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time John returned: "Is she a brilliant church?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not counting The people of the Glorious Church are more weird, and many strangers who have betrayed the church for various reasons have been born."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man said to take the heart back In the direction of Vegniya’s disappearance, “These people call themselves exiles. Each of them has a weird self-principle and runs rampant on the mainland.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Tsu Sog..." John was not reconciled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There will be opportunities in the future. Exiles are generally seen as saving, and then continuing their wandering, with little ongoing protection." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the only way, as long as he is still in the city, he will fall into my hands sooner or later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Someone in the depths of the roadway goes to the basement of the empty house, three people stand by the bed and watch Connor, who is so weak in bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge reached out and examined him: "The situation is not very good, it must be treated immediately. His effusion in the chest and abdomen has affected the normal operation of the organs." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What should we do? We are now isolated, don't talk about doctors, drugs can't be found." Hills was anxious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge turned and asked: "Are you sure he is related to this plague?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Yes! When we met, the soldiers who were chasing him said that he had sneaked into a research institute and knew what he should not know," Hills said firmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Virginia nodded: "The late bell Pope, your followers are not wrong, I swear by my holy sword and the glory of my heart, we all said It’s true.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“What is the ghost of the late bell pope?” Su Ge said in his heart and turned and said: “Get two simple stretchers and put him on Going up, we leave here immediately, I know where to go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two immediately got two sticks and tore off the canvas on the ceiling to make a stretcher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Su Ge quickly left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When two people carefully carried Connor up, Su Ge had returned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go, the carriage is in front," Su Ge said calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Sears was happy, and Vigny was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She did not expect the energy of the Pope to be so great. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He only came for a day or two? Can you get this kind of thing? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After coming out, two people saw a four-wheeled closed carriage that was at least four meters long on the main road not far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a fully armed soldier waiting for everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you actually able to mobilize the army?" Vegginia was even more surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge arbitrarily said: "Basic operation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hills's look She glanced at it as if she had called the carriage herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This guy, the network is not generally wide."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This soldier was last sent to the Soviet Union The soldier of Gee and Elena. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the way, Su Ge has already said it briefly. After the four people got on the bus, the soldiers did not say anything and drove. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the carriage, the lips are chapped, his face is pale, and Connor, who is constantly shaking because of high fever, is temporarily awakened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vague eyes looked at the two familiar women first, and then fell on Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are you?" The incomprehensible voice came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hills said: "This is our leader, you can call him a clockman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Watch the clock?" Connor listened and thought, hoarsely asked: "What do you want to do to me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You should Say what I want to do for you!" Su Ge's tone was a tough answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
