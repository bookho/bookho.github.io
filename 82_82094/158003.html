			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Church of the Holy Blood, in the purification pool on the back side of a small lecture hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shu’s sly squatting in the milky white pool, his hands embracing the body, the whole body is soaked in it, only one head is exposed outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three priests around Su Ge, two of which are familiar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One is Father Anthony, one is Father Hank, and the last one is a senior priest wearing a white gold silk robe that seems to be higher than the priest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three people wrap around the edge of the pool, holding a scented petal in their hands, constantly throwing on Su Ge’s head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After three people are three distinct goddess statues representing the March goddess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a nun under each statue, holding a ceramic jar full of clear water in their hands, and bowing their heads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking around this, Su Ge’s heart is still awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two hours ago he readily accepted the invitation of Father Anthony, and was happy to come here to prepare for a promotion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a series of prayers, vowed to sign a new contract and registration, Suge squatted here, ready to baptize. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The baptism before the church, the name of the body, let the body and spirit be sublimated, in fact, is to test whether the body and spirit of this person is a problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gradually, the pool water rises, the milky white liquid is still cold, but it emits a lot of fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fog accompanied by the fragrance created an eccentric atmosphere, and Sugerton felt a little embarrassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is similar to hypnosis? You can't let your spirits fall into instinct."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Su Ge used his own voice to simulate the bell on the battleship to remind himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is your name?" asked Father Anthony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge whispered in a vague saying: "Sug Sotos."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Have you joined other religions?” The senior priest was questioned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the answer, Su Ge’s heart said: "Want to set it? Too Tender. I have not joined any religion, um... my own established religion is not counted."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have an intersection with other cult personnel? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course not, the Green Flame Brotherhood is not a cult." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you admire other gods?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, this is really not."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s approach to instinctive answers is true However, there is a lot of vague ambiguity in this real bottom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the three priests asked a lot of detailed questions. And Su Ge answered the answer of the seven-point truth and the three-point fake in various angles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all the inquiries, the three men looked at each other and nodded after no problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the three nuns stood up and held the jars and poured the water from the jar into the pool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole pool began to violently boil, and Su Ge felt a lot of weird things rushing into his body along his pores. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This feeling is terrible and disgusting, as if countless worms are getting into the pores and crawling in your body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s still good that Su Ge has experienced great winds and is ready to face this situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The senior priest outside sees and sighs: "I am a man who has drunk the masterpiece of Jerouss, and the will is really firm. I remember that I was baptized." When I was scared, I almost cried out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hank smiled and said: "I am very optimistic about him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; These mysterious substances wandered around the body of Su Ge, with a sour sting and bitterness filling the entire mouth of Su Ge with his throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vomiting and vomiting......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Su Ge began a severe retching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vomiting things are mostly black and green weird viscous liquids with a pungent smell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These things quickly merged into the pool, disappeared completely, and even the smell dissipated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, there is no curse in the body, and there are no other mysterious substances and organs in the accident." Three people nodded at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After everything was determined, the three men looked up in front of each other and raised their hands and said loudly: "Sug Sotos. You have accepted the goddess now. The essence of the goddess in the piety and purity is reborn."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the three men waved their arms together in a bright light, it symbolized The end of the baptism. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge sighed and got up and stood up from the pool and headed for the edge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A hanger with a beautifully crafted, soft and smooth ice blue priest's robe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This robes are very similar to Father Anthony’s robes, but with a few differences. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tight-fitting windbreaker has a longer hem and extends to the calf. The shoulders are silver-gray shawls instead of black, and the lower body is decent black trousers. The solemnity also gives a mystery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"" Put it on, from now on you will become a formal cleric serving the March goddess." Anthony said, a group of six people went straight out . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, it’s rude to watch clothes with others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge wiped his body with a bath towel and found his body lighter after taking the pool, and there was an unspeakable refreshment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this the flesh in the novel? I spit out the impurities in my body!?" Su Ge is a light body. The look is full of happiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put a white shirt and panties, then put on a cool robe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tighten the belt, remember the laces, fix the shawl on the shoulder, and Sug turned to look at the slender priest in the mirror, satisfied with his face. Nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't say, this equipment is a bit like Gonzs in the King of Fighters 96." Su Ge snorted and picked up his cane and went out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vestibule of the church, the three priests and the three nuns were happy to stand under the image of God waiting for Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, it looks a lot more handsome." When Sug came out, Anthony said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hank introduced and said: "Suge, tell you about it. This is our deputy bishop, Laurie Kenan."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello! Deputy Bishop, thank you for participating in my baptism." Su Ge bowed his head and said with respect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laurion said with a sly smile: "This is okay, I have heard about your deeds. At this critical point, you can Standing bravely, even even drinking the potion to save the soul of the believer, I have longed for a long time. And this time the annihilation of the cult is also thanks to your intelligence, if not you tell the Jerome Master Green Flame Brotherhood We will not be so prepared in advance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
