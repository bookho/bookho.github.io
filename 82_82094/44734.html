			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, when Su Ge arrived at the police station, he entered a five-hour meeting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the meeting, Su Ge knew that the days of leisure had gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the bomb problem has caused great concern throughout the city of Bain, Bishop Ron and Mayor of Arnold of the Church of the Holy Blood in Bain have jointly conducted the entire city. Thorough investigation to ensure that there are no more hidden bombs and to determine if there are other embers in the death sect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demon lord’s Jeros took the lead, along with the five hunters, the exorcist, the night patrol and the city police, to carry out a thorough cleaning By the way, confirm the situation of two witches hidden in the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the martial law is very strong, during the day everyone goes to the Church of the Holy Blood to conduct lie detection, through the portrait to identify. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Su Ge also took advantage of the situation, saw the portraits of Hills and Bernice, two young and innocent girls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly conduct a carpet search of the entire city to ensure that there is no mysterious energy anywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third entire city is blocked, can not be out, can not enter, the identity of all people, including the tramp must be verified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last curfew, except for the relevant personnel after 6 o'clock, no one can leave the house, and all night shifts in the factory are temporarily suspended. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the whole city is full of winds and sorrows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But what surprised Su Ge was that the public and the factory, and even the merchants whose goods were blocked, did not have any dissatisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because they are very clear, their lives are more important than their interests. The harm of cults is obvious to all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the martial law began, Su Ge was very hard and very hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the only priest in the city of Bain today, he is involved in almost all cases involving the dead, in order to determine the circumstances of the deceased and the confirmation of intelligence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of the investigation, Su Ge was still scared and worried about the witch’s leakage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the subsequent investigation, Su Ge was relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the limited staff, they are only able to investigate densely populated urban areas, and the densely populated areas such as villages and wilderness are not scrupulous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In seven days, Su Ge started working at 7:00 every day and was busy until late at night to go home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although very tired, but Sugqan is very strong. Because he got a good return. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seven days, Su Ge has surpassed fifteen dead souls, detected five ordinary murders, and found three mysterious anomalies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability to be so efficient has given Suger a high degree of recognition in the police station and has successfully reached a good friend with the police. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, Su Ge, who is constantly surpassing the soul, condensing the spirit, and using the ability frequently, has greatly enhanced the control and use of the psionic power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the advantage of the priest in this position is highlighted. By surpassing the soul, Su Ge spirit can be sublimated and baptized, so that his very unstable spirit becomes stable. Calm, my mind and my thoughts have been greatly improved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time in the work and departmental collaboration, Su Ge finally came into contact with the mysterious organization of the other two churches: the sinner and the exorcist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are five people in the city of Bain, who are priests of the church. But they are not praying for people, listening to the confessed priest, but the priest who holds the gun and holds the sword to master all kinds of battles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a total of seven exorcism nuns, which happens to be an exorcist squad. The exorcist and the sorcerer are similar. They used to be ordinary people. Later they joined the church and became exorcist after hard work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the scepter and the exorcist are inferior to the demon and the night stalker in battle. But the status between the four is flat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike the killing machine, the demon slayer and the exorcist are all very devout church believers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seven days of intense hardship, the city gradually returned to normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seven-day martial law has been very successful, not only caught more than a dozen criminals who have been absconding for many years, but also found six other cult organizations that are hidden, and Three kidnapped hostages were rescued. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The six people are mainly from two organizations, the Green Flame Brotherhood, and the cold-hearted church that Suge heard several times before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, the keen Hunter once again found seven hidden sects of the dead sect, two of whom mastered mystery and the other five were normal . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the cost of bombing is high and they are not discovering other bombs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, two conclusions were confirmed through the analysis of Logan and Gerlos:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1: Death sect The city of Bain has been completely withdrawn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2: Two witches have left Bain City to escape to other cities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former has been confirmed through the intelligence of the soul and the arrested personnel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter is based on the witch's habits and actual situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The witches themselves will not spend too much time in one place, they are more than seeking destruction, but escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a thorough cleaning, the city of Bain seems to be much fresher, giving a feeling of renewal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, the martial law ended, the citizens resumed normal work and life, the factory started, and people’s nightlife returned to normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;March calendar December 5, 12557, Sunday, Xiaoxue, the temperature is minus 15 degrees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At ten in the morning, Su Ge blurted and squinted out of the bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shuger, who had been busy for seven days, got three days of paid vacation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I came out, I saw Black wearing a gray loose dress and walking in with a leather hat. His side was a lively second. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This seven days, Su Ge is too busy, and the work of walking the dog every day is handed over to Black and Winnie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sug, you should shave." Black took off his hat and said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today is the weekend, Winnie and Black are both resting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Winnie went out to a literary salon and left at eight o'clock in the morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge scratched his head and went into the bathroom to look at himself in the mirror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The work of seven days in a row, day and night, Su Ge hair is unkempt, cheeks and chin are full of yellow beard, this time looks like Jack and Man The head of the head looks a little like it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am almost a yellow-haired orangutan." Su Ge began to wash and shave with a wry smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black stood at the door and sighed: "I didn't expect the police detective to be so busy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge spit and said: "It's all a matter of death sect. The bomb can give the church and the police a huge stimulus, and martial law is normal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Head, then a proud face said: "Hey, I can have a face now at school. When you took the team to check a few days ago, when my classmates heard that you were my brother, they all looked envious." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge puts the bubble on his beard and picks up the razor and warns: "It is good to have a face, but don't make anything bad. Things, we are the underlying civilians, and we are deeply aware of the pain of being oppressed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
