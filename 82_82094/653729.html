			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After telling Mei’s true identity, Su Ge once again said the message he got from Green. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it was finished, Vanas frowned and said: "If this is the case, in the capacity of Merris, she can pass the permission of the church. Directly arrested Niya. The relationship between the Steam Guild and the March Church is not good. In this way, the church can also get the knowledge that Niya has mastered and push things to the female warlock."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this Su Ge spirit, I slammed my head: "Not good!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finished, he was facing Ai Deline and Gerlos said: "Without my orders, don't move!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the body disappears directly from the pilgrimage hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas turned to face the Frost Witch and others, and said: "Then we will discuss the issue of the cold cup of the North Wind." ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wake up from the bed, Sug turned over and quickly put on the line of his late church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong?" asked Shirley, who was reading the novel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug brought a mask and said in a tone: "All this is a bureau."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Need me to shoot?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You stay here, after I leave, it is estimated that someone will attack here, you protect Bernice and Betty. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge finished, the body flew out of the window like a big bird. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While flying out, the aftermath of Su Ge’s late bell began to extend greatly, and the radius directly covered a distance of more than one hundred meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this moment, he discovered three mysterious people hidden in the dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he doesn’t care so much, these people are handed over to Shirley for treatment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adding a soul cognitive disorder to himself, none of these low-skilled spies saw Su Ge leave the apartment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, located on the west side of the city, close to an apartment in Imperial Central College. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Niya, wearing a black bachelor’s suit, looked at the students who passed out on the floor, and the blue eyes gradually rose into a glimmer of light, which was so glaring in the dark. And mysterious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just now, the two female warlocks sneaked into the room and fainted all of her students and accompanying staff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the most restrained Pioneer, at this time stood in front of themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;噼里啪啦......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A burst of glare current flashing on her hands, deep and intellectual The eyes looked at the two female warlocks in front of me: "You actually betrayed the female warlock."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can be so bright and standing here to attack her, ordinary female warlocks dare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that dares to get the acquiescence of the Church of the Holy Blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two female warlocks on the opposite side did not speak and seemed to be waiting for something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current is getting richer, just as Niya is ready to shoot, the female warlock on the left suddenly shot, actually stunned her companion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"??"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Niya sees this state of mind suddenly unexpected, but does not relax alert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female warlock took off the hood and showed her way: "Hello, Ms. Tesla, my name is Yeta, it is Odin Asa. Mr. Xin’s loyal servant.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Odin Assassin?” Hearing this Nija’s heart, he is just in his student’s mouth today. I heard the name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iyeta added: "He is the cousin of Miss Bernice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, Niya seemed to figure out what she was going through, and she relaxed her inner nervousness. Road: "What is going on?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am leaving here soon, Ms. Mei’s person is here soon, she is going to take you back." Iyeta said seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Niya did not act rashly and asked: "The whole city is a person of the Church of the Holy Blood. Where can we escape? It is easy to meet the night watchers when going out "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In order to facilitate our actions, the nearby night watchman has been temporarily transferred by Archbishop Saru, and we will now meet with Mr. Assassin as soon as possible. He has very strong strength and can protect us!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, Niya silently agreed for one second, then two people quickly ran out of the apartment , disappeared in the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those unconscious colleagues and students, she is not worried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mystery has no interest in unsuspecting ordinary people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And since it is already faint, it means that the Church of the Holy Blood does not allow them to move too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Running quickly on the street, Niya asked: "How can you be his servant? You should be very fanatical about these resurrection female warlocks." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iyeta sighed: "Speaking long, I intended to lurk for a while, but I already feel that Ms. Mei is not trusting me." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, a cold voice came: "Ieta, I heard your words, I really feel deep about you. Disappointment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this voice, Iyeta was stiff in the moment, like an ice sculpture frozen by the cold wind, the horrible chill from her Out of the soul, it freezes everything about her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the sound coming out, a lady wearing a light gray robes and a white mask with a cross came out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a dozen mysterious people who came out with her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among these mysterious people, only three are female warlocks, the rest have free mysteries, and even the clergy of the Church of the Holy Blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Niya looked at the whole body with a strong atmosphere, Ms. Mei, with a cold expression: "I have no interest in your invitation, regardless of the country of the female warlock." Or give the Holy Blood Church a running dog."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has received Ms. Mei’s invitation more than once, after all, the name of the Electric Queen is really in the whole world. It’s too loud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has even been called the incarnation of electricity, with the steam guild personnel, to the palaces of dozens of countries to complete the evolution from gas to electricity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in the Royal Palace of the Belland Empire, she personally designed and implemented it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Mei has long been a master of this knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms. Ms. Ms. calmly answered: "However, it is a pity that you have no room for refusal and no other options. If you don't want to die, or if you don't want to die, So, you can only join my majesty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Niya slowly clenched his fists, and the glare of the current gradually rose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, just as she was about to work hard, Ms. Mei took out a piece of white, handkerchief without any lines and stains, waving at random. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next second, Niya suddenly pale, and the body immediately sat on the ground, as if the body lost all power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms. Mei turned her head slowly, and her eyes looked like a goblin in the cold, looking at the stiff Iyer: "You know how to betray my end." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Iyeta trembled and gritted his teeth and said, "I know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "The courage is really not small." Ms. Mei did not answer slowly, with a chilly and vicious chill in her tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
