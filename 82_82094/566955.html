			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A leisurely walk through the city, two people sitting on the beach by the sea, watching the rough seas in the dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since ability becomes a bondage, why do humans want to be eager?" Shirley's white hand gently moved in the night, as if caressing Same as your own pet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug knows that she caressed her pet, and this pet, named Dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, the greater the ability, the greater the responsibility, I also realized another truth." Su Ge casually said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The greater the ability, the more girls." Very serious answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl faintly understands what this sentence means, and casually says: "It is a matter of course for the superior to have a beautiful lower person."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded: "Yeah! So now, knowing that mystery is very dangerous, you have to plung it in, just to get the ability to make others look at each other while climbing up "There are people below."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that humans and animals are no different."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Human itself is an animal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of dialogue full of life philosophy has happened many times in the past two years, Su Ge hopes Shirley Through these reasons, we can better integrate into this society. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Shirley seems to forget when he is finished, still doing his own thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At nine o'clock in the evening, two people returned to the hotel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I just went back, Su Ge suddenly felt a slight nuance of volatility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The direction of the wave is coming from the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the volatility flashed past, and Su Ge didn't care too much, and the two left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When two people left for a while, a skin was pale, and the young man in a silk suit climbed up from the waves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looks very embarrassed, but his right hand has seized a very worn pocket watch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gasped, and then the shape of the wolverine quickly returned to normal, and there seemed to be invisible power in the asylum of his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was kneeling on the yellow sand and looked down at the bottom of the dilapidated pocket watch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a special mark on it, it is a circular pattern with three petals, two of which seem to be some sort of hook, the remaining one The main line is slightly curved and seems to be a sharp claw of some kind of creature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The root link of the three people is at a point, extending equidistantly around, just looking like an indescribable mysterious magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Everyone, die!" The youth's demeanor is somewhat distorted, and his mouth is as big as a zombie to eat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the moonlight, it is faintly seen that his shadow has changed, and his hands seem to have become some kind of inhuman tentacles...<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, Su Ge had two breakfasts and put on two tailor-made clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is still a habitual black suit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley clothes are a black tight-fitting, lotus leaf dress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This style of clothing is tailor-made for her, she does not like the waist of this era, and does not like the support of the skirt inside, she pursues It is comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s okay, her body is too perfect, and even if she wears a tramp dress, she can show a beautiful and beautiful man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plan for two people today is to visit the famous statue of the city during the day: Haiwangyan, and attend the concert of star Elisa in the evening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just coming out, Albert went out with a mysterious look: "Mr. Black Mist, please be careful these days."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's wrong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert whispered: "I received a message last night, somewhere in the ancient forest A tomb was stolen from the tomb thief, and the demon spirit hidden inside and the soul of an ancient emperor were released. Two villages have been slaughtered in the night. The healing church has initiated the martial law procedure."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you heard this, Su Ge browed and looked at Xue Lier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Look at what I did, I didn't touch the pyramid!" Xue Lier gave him a white look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pyramid?" Albert glimpsed, then suddenly his eyes widened: "Don't..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Su Ge put his hand on the wave: "The place has indeed been there, but I knew the things inside in advance, and we left immediately after we were not sure."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;He said that he touched his chin: "If there is no accident, it should be caused by some other people who do not understand the rules."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unruly People generally refer to those who rob the tomb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people are ordinary people. I don’t know about mystery. If I haven’t met the place, it’s fried. So I often blow up some time-honored characters and release them. Some troublesome things come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert bitterly said: "In the past few years, there have been a pair of male and female scorpions, often with tombs and dangers from all over the world, and kept in succession. Where are you going to go, where is the record of the accident, what are you two?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough cough!" Su Ge coughs Again, I waved my hand: "It's all rumors, don't care too much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley's mouth showed a smile and smiled very happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She likes to watch Su Ge’s expression of being awkward, and she wants to laugh when she sees it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert smiled slightly and asked: "What are the two plans now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If this is the case, it is better to leave here as soon as possible." Although Su Ge is not too afraid of the March church, their influence in the world is indeed too great. If they are found, they will escape. It can also cause a lot of trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He, afraid of trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley is a bit uncomfortable: "What about my musical?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Too easy to cause Trouble, don't you want to put your favorite skirt on the plasma?" Su Ge directly poked the soft underbelly of Sherry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl bites his teeth and wants to slap Su Ge, but it is against Albert, no hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the two are leaving, the port just happens to have a storm-class cruise ship that will sail in an hour and a half. More coincidentally, I have just more Two tickets," Albert said, with a hint of smirk on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge smiled a little: "Where is the destination?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Belle Empire, Empire port," Albert said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled: "Exactly, I have not been to the capital of the motherland. It has been good in the past."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afterwards, two people returned to the hotel to pick up their luggage and followed Albert to the port. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just out of the hotel to get on the carriage, Su Ge suddenly felt a stinking smell coming over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, a black shadow swooped at Sherry with a heavy gasp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night bell protects the black shadow directly, Su Ge is not good at turning his head: "This is not a golden city, there must be a sperm on the brain." Limit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man who was popped three meters away and the skin was pale, slowly stood up, with a madness, staring at Shirley, with eagerness and obsession in his eyes: "The Virgin! The Virgin! For my Lord Let's go to the child!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, like the estrus of the male dog rushed up again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shirley frowned, his fists slowly tightened, and he was very upset about this young man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't make trouble." Su Ge said, send her to the carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I’m leaving here right away, and Su Ge doesn’t want this festival to keep the church or the police eyeing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the central part of a civilized society. It is a first-tier city. Even if it is drunk, it will be caught by the police for a few days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Shirley’s punch smashed the youth into a mud, it would be a big problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man who just rushed over was once again bombed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug had just turned to the carriage and suddenly felt a violent mysterious wave coming from behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After suddenly looking back, it was just that the young man’s eyes became miserable, and a strange mark appeared on his forehead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At this time..." Su Ge suddenly shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a few big men rushed out of the hotel to overwhelm them, then a mysterious person came over and gently touched the young forehead, this youth suddenly dizzy The past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;叮! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the fainting, the dilapidated pocket watch with no chains in the hands of the youth fell and rolled to the foot of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge picked up the watch and hid the watch when the big men didn’t respond. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am sorry! Mr. Black Mist." The expert hypnotist came over and apologized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the site of the Traveller’s House, where guests are attacked on their own site, which is a big problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug shook his head and said: "Be careful later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am sorry, I I am sorry to give you a one-week discount." The hypnotist once again apologized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled a little: "Well, busy with you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, Take the carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The departure of two dark carriages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hypnotist said coldly: "Carry in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!"< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the carriage, Su Ge looked at the silence of his pocket watch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl came over and took a look: "A disgusting breath."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge looked at the special symbol on the pocket watch and sighed: "It’s a wave of unrest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You mean to say that I am The same trouble as this yellow waste!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speaker is unintentional, the listener is interested. When she was snowy, she had a stunned look and a look of discomfort and anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger smiled and waved his hand: "I didn't say you, I thank you for the things in the ancient city. I just didn't expect it to suddenly come across." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A yellow print only." Xue Lier said freely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger wants more: "The cause and effect of this thing, it really can't hide."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
