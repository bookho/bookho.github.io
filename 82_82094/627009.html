			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to the two people, Su Ge’s mouth was very big, and he was very rude. He said, “I am my cousin, thank you Mr. Hausmann. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people look very thorough, Su Ge is not short of money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the two people know more clearly that Bernice is definitely not the cousin of Su Ge, and it is likely to be similar to the existence of subordinates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That means, to Bernice, is to give Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, they also investigated that the Bernice store wanted to expand and was caught in the bottleneck due to the venue problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Duke personally took the opportunity to take a cup of 120 square meters in just one afternoon tea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This store is quite expensive in the city of Jinhui Yao. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the price on the market, this commercial store is priced at around 10,000 francs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ten thousand francs, even for Su Ge, is not a small amount. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, Duke expressed not only gratitude, but more to show and draw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug knows what he means, and he is very willing to make this huge consortium. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When are we going to drink blood wine?" At this time, the already dressed up Shirley stood on the second floor, like a tall queen, condescending Asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke didn’t feel the slightest discomfort, his eyes lit up and said: “Do you want to drink blood wine? That’s really good, my family just came here yesterday. The latest blood wine developed by the church has been heard to be made from the blood of a unicorn. It has the effect of strengthening the kidney and strengthening the body for men, and has the effect of whitening and moisturizing the skin for women."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing the kidney and strengthening the yuan, Su Ge immediately came to the interest, said with a smile: "If this is the case, then it is best. Wait a moment, after we have finished packing, we will show you your uncle. Situation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half an hour later, under Betty’s amazed gaze, two people left Beth Street in the carriage of the Hausmann family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s really amazing to have an adult." Betty saw this and was even more happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We will come back to eat at night." At this time, the sound of Shirley came from the faraway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Betty looked at the ingredients in his hand and was happy to return home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half an hour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Su Ge walked down the carriage and looked around, he saw a dark red, four-storey villa with a battlefield area of ​​about three hundred meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke said: "This is not the family's main house, it is my home."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" A single-family house assigned to you in adulthood?" Read a question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke nodded and walked in with Sug. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The villa is large in size, with a square full of flowers and trees in front, with wide yards on both sides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other side of the villa looks like this is not a small area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While walking, Duke introduced the situation: "My uncle drank too much yesterday, so I stayed at my house for the time being, I was planning to go to the Lion Empire today, but Suddenly found this situation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Does your father know?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke nodded: "Know, please come, I also proposed to my father and get permission."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the speech, the attendant opened the door of the villa, and two people walked into the wide hall of the main entrance of the villa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But due to the urgency, the two did not stop here, turned and walked down the stairs to the left to a bedroom on the third floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the door of the bedroom, there was a faint snoring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two brawny guards at the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Duke coming, the two respectfully let go and open the door to let a few people in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no mess in the sixty square meter bedroom, it seems that it has been cleaned up again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it smells like a stink in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In bed, a middle-aged man who was somewhat obese and dressed in dark blue pajamas was tied to the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The limbs were firmly fixed and the mouth was slammed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can see that he is soaked in sweat all over the body, but he is still struggling constantly, with a confused fear in his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirle said faintly: "It’s disgusting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The face is disgusted and stands in the distance, just like seeing an ugly bug. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug went to the middle-aged person and looked down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man struggled even more when he saw Su Ge’s approach, his forehead was blue and his face was red, his mouth was constantly embarrassing. The voice seems to want to say something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing here, Su Ge’s faint feeling is a bit cold after his neck, and there seems to be a chill that is blowing from somewhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This suddenly caused Su Ge’s vigilance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, Su Ge expands his arms and hands together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of blue horror cold flames appeared in the hands of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the whisper of Su Ge, the cold flame was swallowed up by some invisible existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, the flame was swallowed up, and the coolness behind Su Ge’s neck disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So close to seeing this scene, Duke two people with wide eyes, a look of surprise and curiosity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge then reached out and casually photographed on the body of a middle-aged man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;刺刺......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like countless knives flashing, middle-aged pajamas Broken, revealing a bloated inside, full of golden chest hair upper body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My God, what is this spell?" The two saw this, and suddenly they were shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing here, that should be on the back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug said, Take a shot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Invisible sharp edges instantly cut the rope around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be careful!" Duke hurriedly reminded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice is not falling, the middle-aged man is struggling, just like crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s calm and calm grasp of his neck, faintly said: “Honest.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;With these three words coming, the violent middle-aged people seem to be afraid of what they are, and they suddenly return to silence and do not move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My God! This kind of means is simply... unbelievable." Duke looked very good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ming Ming Jing has grown by two points, but he still can't extricate himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug turned over the middle-aged man’s body, his eyes swept twice, and reached out and took a gray object from his purse. Said: "The reason was found, come and see."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people rushed over and looked down, Duketon looked shocked: "What is this? Something!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
