			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to Father Sini’s story, Su Ge looked down at the book on the waist and found that the book contained a lot of secrets he could not understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Myra can read this book, right?" Su Ge asked. Father Cini nodded slightly: "She told me that she felt that she had linked this book with some aspect. This book allowed her to peep." The contents of it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looked at the night ahead, and asked deeply: "You got this book back, how are you going to do it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to save Myra through this book." Father Cagnes first said something human. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge heard some surprises, and did not expect Father Cagnes to say such things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am still alone." Father Sini has a hint of shrewd light in his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After saving Myra? This book continues to keep her safe?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I will look for an opportunity to send this book back to where it belongs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The fishing village?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Father Cagne did not answer: "This has nothing to do with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge chuckled: "I did not care about it before, but now this book In my hands, it is naturally related to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You really want to fight with me for your life!?" Father Sini’s eyes are like an eagle eye. sharp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge patted him on the shoulder: "Don't be so hostile. First, Myra will definitely save it. Because this is my responsibility, this is me." Commitment to Emilia. Secondly, if you want to get the best out of this book, then in the world today, it is the most reassuring in my hands."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't know the power of its horror at all." Father Cagnere said seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know, but He knows." Su Ge's eyes slammed into the ice-blue ghosts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this pair of inhuman eyes, Father Sini immediately thought of the horrible inhuman form of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a time, Father Sini was in silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people marched silently along the street, as if they were two good friends who came home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who are you!" Father Sini was still unwilling to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence has been met for the first time since the two people met. Now he has asked Su Ge four times, although the content of the sentence is exactly the same, but the meaning of each inquiry Not the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Su Ge did not have a clear answer, and this time, Su Ge did not sell off, the expression looked very calm and casually said: "My will Incarnation, the apostle who preached the gods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pump! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Father Sini trembled in his heart, and he was not a so-called person for being an incarnation and an apostle! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has seen two people who claim to be apostles, and both of them are beyond the limits of his imagination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third place you see today is still the case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has no doubts about Su Ge’s words, because the gesture that has just changed his body can make his vision grow, and it has already indicated the extraordinaryness of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Afterwards, Father Cagne did not continue to ask for a book, smoking a cigarette in silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two people are not shunning now, so they are walking brightly on the street like a church patrolman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, what surprised Su Ge was that Su Ge did not see a night watchman and clergy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The arrival of the king of yellow clothes disturbed the entire city's defense system." Su Ge looked up at the three moons in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the faint, he saw an indescribable shadow. It seems that the shadow is composed of the wind, constantly floating in the air, and even obscuring the light of the three rounds of the moon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French Sini spit out the smoke circle and said: "The influence of the king of yellow clothes is comprehensive, not biased. The intersection of old dreams and the real world, only It will have an impact on mysterious people who have more than twenty sights. It has no effect on ordinary people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge heard it: "How do you know? So detailed?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“This is the information shared within the church. Don’t look too small at the church’s data collection ability. This information is half an hour after the incident. I got it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have never looked down on any power of the church. I am just curious as to why they told you this information." Ge said with a cane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French Sini is a bit stiff and does not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corner of Su Ge’s mouth showed a smile, and it seemed that he was right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I asked other people." After a dozen seconds, Father Sini said with great effort in a calm tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;haha! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Su Ge didn’t hold back and laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French Sini was somewhat dissatisfied, and while still talking, the two heard a whistle at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the wind, two people blurryly seeing a shadow flying through the sky with huge wings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, on the southwest side of the two people, there was a shrill scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The church was attacked.” Father Sini heard this, his body was tense and his body rushed out like a bullet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The side of Su Ge looked at the back of Father Sini, hesitating, and then followed the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there are doubts about the teachings and policies of the Church of the Holy Blood, he still has a friendly attitude towards some dedicated clergy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, he also wants to see what is going on in this church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The church that was attacked is not far from the two, and the straight line is only about one kilometer away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black robe fluttered up, with Su Ge’s body moving quickly between buildings, less than five minutes, Sug’s side was slightly In some office buildings, look down. First, Su Ge saw a group of church members who were grouped together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are about fifty people in these churches, half of whom are ordinary church members and half are clergy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clergyman is dominated by the scepter and the exorcist, with three patrolmen and two hunters in the middle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These clergy are maintenance personnel who are used daily to maintain safety and deal with ordinary mysterious events. The overall combat effectiveness is not strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a group of Yi people surrounded by these people, and a group of the most important Yi people: crawlers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crawler, also known as the locust, the lower servant of the Yi, needs twenty-nine points to see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The creeper is the most disgusting Dai, it is made up of thousands of locusts, which are normally bound by invisible forces and are held together. The shape of a human body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But among them, each locust survives independently and moves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People still don’t know where the Yi people came from, and some scholars say they are monsters crawling out of the abyss. Some scholars also say that every crawler is a human being. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those locusts are produced by the decay of the human body, and the invisible force that binds the type of locust formation is the soul that lingers in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the principles of its formation are not verified, it is certain that the creeper was in the third dynasty of the sandstorm, which appeared during the Calding Dynasty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and there are indications that the creeper and the great king of yellow clothes are inextricably linked, and may even be the servants of the king of yellow clothes. One. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crawler is not very strong, and its main role is disgusting. The creeper does not speak but can write, and can use most of the cold weapons like normal humans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main means of attack is close combat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body is very flexible and full of elasticity, and the damage caused by ordinary weapons and bullets is very subtle, which can achieve great advantages in close combat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also note that the mites on the crawler's body have special human toxins that can paralyze the human nerves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If caught by a creeper, a large area of ​​contact with mites, suffering from paralysis of the body is only a minor problem, once the respiratory system is paralyzed, it is likely to suffocate And die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be seen here that for some reason, these locusts actually broke the system of vision, the clergy were okay, and ordinary church personnel saw it. He groaned on the ground constantly, sneezing a tear, his face pale, and his appearance was very miserable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The state of the clergy is not good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are ordinary clergy who deal with everyday mysterious events. Many of the Yi people have only seen it in books. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden seeing of the most disgusting Yi people in the legend. These people were not good at all, and even a few of them started to vomit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The few relatively calm are the three night hunters and two hunters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, about thirty disgusting crawlers surrounded them and continually attacked them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The creepers were holding rusted spears, holding big knives, and madly waving with a hammer. The power was actually bigger than the clergy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These clergymen are constantly defending and attacking through the hunting of magic bullets and various spells, techniques, and mysterious materials, while resisting hard and waiting with hope. Rescue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg still hasn’t shot, it’s not that he has become cold-blooded again, just because Father Sini is here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is more focused on these church members. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although these church members are embarrassed and scared, they are not messy and crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast, their eyes are full of firmness, and their inner defense is very stable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have a strong belief that they will be fearless as long as the faith does not collapse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priests around the tacit cooperation, calm and calm battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The internal church staff, monks, priests, nuns, etc. close their eyes and pull this hand, the voice is firm and steady, singing melodious, magnificent, inspiring The hymn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although they are all ordinary people, this hymn itself has a special mysterious effect, plus the singing and firm religious beliefs of this group of people, actually let This song has a small increase in inner and spiritual power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The line of defense that was about to collapse was temporarily reluctantly stabilized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, it is only temporary, and the fighting power between the two sides is huge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Su Ge’s analysis, these people will die in the hands of these creepers in less than five minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, Su Ge is not prepared to witness the tragedy again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
