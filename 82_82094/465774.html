			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green looked at the confident and generous Su Ge, quietly asked: "Do you know how dangerous it is to sneak into other people's dreams?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How dangerous is it!?" Su Ge asked calmly, seemingly well-informed, knowing everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, he doesn't know how dangerous it is. After all, this is his first time in life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green looks at the world of blood and says: "The dream world is a very fragile world. However, the fragility is ultimately the world. This world will follow people's The state of sleep becomes stable and fragile. When the dreamer suddenly wakes up, the world of dreams is broken, and the spirit you sneak into in the world will be completely smashed and killed."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have seen many dreamers, many of whom are masters, but most of them have died in the dreams of others. For them, enter unfamiliar strangers In dreams, it is the most dangerous behavior."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although the general thief can control the situation of some invaders' dreams, this kind of control will follow The distance is weakened and weakened. The distance from Bain City to the capital makes you have no control over my dreams."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green icy Look at him: "You are in my dream now, and my dream is over, I can wake up at any time. I can say that I am in control of your life now!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge heard thoughtfully: "There was so much to say, I was worried. "It's not superfluous."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I admire your courage, and dare to sneak into my dreams across thousands of miles when I hear the words of the subordinate. But courage It’s just a relatively good vocabulary. I like to call your current behavior a reckless.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge listened carefully and nodded: “The Marquis’s action for me. The evaluation is really the precision of the ghosts and crying gods. It is really reckless for me to come directly here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green continues: "So we have no possibility of cooperation." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't like to deal with people who are reckless. This kind of person works only with the heart, is irrational, has a strong personality, and is easy to be bad. I admire your achievements and consciousness, but this does not mean that you and I have the possibility of cooperation. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sugg looked at Green unexpectedly, and then his face showed a hint of exclamation: "It is an imperial general, the logic of thinking is extraordinary."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then leave quickly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green is silent watching the blood around: "I don't like it I want to wake up in this scenery."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, a statement The voice came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green Brow looked at Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The reason why the Marquis was not happy is that this scenery is wrong?" Su Ge looked awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The green eyebrows wrinkled together and did not speak. After <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, he saw the most horrible thing he had fought for decades. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge calmly raised his hand and made a finger: "Then change the world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, Green found a new world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a sunny seaside, blue sky and blue sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sunlight shines on the white sand, like countless gems sparkling very beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing on the street not far from the beach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The streets are wide and tidy, two willows, soft breeze blowing, people can not help but sigh the beauty of this world, this beautiful scenery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is...this is..." Green trembled fiercely at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sit!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s voice came again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smelled and saw a brown bench behind him, and Su Ge made it easy to do it and sent an invitation to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instinctively, he sat down and silenced for half a minute. The voice asked with shock and hoarseness: "This is my dream, how can you reach it?" This is the place?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the point?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green Binoculars staring at him: "How can you have the ability to take full control of my dreams!?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this not a very simple thing?" Su Ge raised his hand and made a finger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, there are many pedestrians in the open world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These pedestrians talk and laugh, or walk alone, or two or three, some people hold children, some couples sit together...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green’s eyes wide open, his eyes stunned and looked at the incomparable real pedestrians. The clear laughter passed into his ears and made him feel the world. Just like real. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, Green felt his heart tremble constantly, his hands creaking, staring at Su Ge and asking: "Who are you?" ?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge relaxed on the bench, leaning against the legs: "Isn't you already introduced it? It's really expensive for you!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green is stiff and motionless: "You know what I mean."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "I know what you mean, but that's what it means. It's enough to introduce it once, and it's boring to introduce it again," Su Ge said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green listened to silence, the corner of his eyes looked at the bright world, watching the passing pedestrians, his heart burst into cold: "You know that you now represent What?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Talk about it!" said Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green voice hoarsely said: "This control of dreams has exceeded the conventional four levels and entered the lord level."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it just the lord? I don’t think the lord can reach me." Su Ge said, there were two goblets with drinks in his hand. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Handing Green a cup, Suge took a sip of a pity: "There is no taste in the dream, but unfortunately this wine is good."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green's body stiffened and pinched the cup, feeling the true touch and coolness, he suddenly had a feeling of suffocation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was scared in his heart, he wanted to wake up from this dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, the situation that made him desperate appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s voice suddenly came out: “Don’t go in a hurry, our business has not been finished yet.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear this, Green knows that if it is not the other party's consent, he can't get out of this dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, he is a master mysterious person who has experienced countless big winds and waves, taking a deep breath, calming down just shocked, and the sound has recovered from the very beginning of stability: "Please say. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The glass of Su Ge’s hand squirmed and became a bright red blood sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Just your evaluation of me is reckless, not enough to work with you, then now, how do you rate me?" Su Ge puts the player metal ball, Ask casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green Silence for a few seconds: "Confidence is strong and unpredictable. It is my pleasure to work with people like you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled and threw the blood sacrifices into the sea in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Things are for you, you want a favor, but don't you?" Su Ge asked softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green's eyes turned and found that the wine glass in his hand had become a horrible blood sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The nature is not too much, but it depends on what kind of human feelings. I can't repay your favor." Although Green was scared, but Does not mean that he was scared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge looked at him with great satisfaction: "The temperament is firm, not humble, swearing, well-founded. It is a legendary admiral, indeed qualified to use with me." This legendary word."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green looked at him calmly, did not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug continued: "I don't have any good feelings for the church because of the witch. I will leave the church soon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this Green’s heart: “Would you like to leave the Church of the Holy Blood?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“How? Not happy?” Su Ge asked with a smile. Green shook his head: "This is not, it is just a little shocked. With your means and mind, you can reach the position of the central archbishop in a few years, even In the future, I hope to become a pope. Why should I leave the church?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge looked up at the sky: "It is too small."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;! ! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green looked at Su Ge with a stunned expression and felt incredible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a loyal and determined anti-church member, he has heard countless negative comments about the church, cold-blooded, dirty, disgusted, disdainful... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no matter how insulting anyone, evaluating the church, everyone has a common understanding, that is a behemoth that cannot be easily shaken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many years, no one has ever evaluated the Church of the Holy Blood too small! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The afterglow of Su Ge’s eyes saw Green’s appearance, reaching out to the sky, and the dark eyes with clear and brilliant brilliance said: “The future, When you see the four words in the evening clock, I hope that you can give them a convenience."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, Su Ge added: "Of course, it will not be discovered by others."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stop, Su Ge added: "But you Don't worry, people who can find you will not be easily found."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green silence for a few seconds, seriously: "Good!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't you ask a few times?" Su Ge had some surprises. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green demeanor with calmness and self-confidence: "Without paying, there is no return. I have a high evaluation of you, then my investment cost will be higher, more What's more..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shook his metal red ball in his hand: "I have received a reward in advance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge heard the grin and smiled very happy: "I like to deal with people like you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green truthfully responded: "I don't like to deal with people like you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" Su Ge is not angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green pinches his fist: "Because I prefer to lead the conversation, I don't like being led by others."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Ha ha ha! I really care about you more and more, Marquis adults!" Su Ge is really happy, as if to make a good friend's child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compared with Su Ge’s pleasure, Green’s heart is a little heavier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he said, he likes to lead others rather than being dominated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug, too strong, strong enough to make him feel fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg seems to see through his mind, calmly said: "Don't think too much, you are my partner, not a subordinate. I don't think To lead you, just hope that through this good relationship, you can give us some help in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course, help is mutual. If you have If you are not convenient, you can also find us to do it. We have a lot of talents in the evening church and should be able to meet most of your needs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
