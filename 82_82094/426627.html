			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe because of today’s Sunday, this group of Playboys have gone out of the way, and two people have come across all the way without encountering an unopened little cockroach. Provocation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slightly regretted to come to the side of the villa in front of the side, just to see a light blue short robe, white long pants, short white shoes The women came out and seemed to be going out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman is about one meter six, almost forty years old, looks quite ordinary, but has an eye-catching golden curl and a very beautiful light blue eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the good maintenance, the skin is fair and delicate, the golden curls naturally fall down, with the rimless glasses on the nose and the intellectual and steady body of mature women, Gives a very sexy temperament. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the woman came out, she seemed to be thinking about something. When I opened the door, I seemed to feel people. I looked up and saw that I just saw Su Gezheng. Smiling at myself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At first glance, the woman feels the special and extraordinary of this young man, and then the thought turns, the temptation asks: "You are Su Ge. Bishop Sotos?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge smiled and nodded: "You are Adeline's student, Niya Tesla?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Niya nodded in response, light blue eyes carefully looked at the young man, and his heart was a little surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to what the teacher said to herself, her evaluation of the young man is very high, she can clearly feel the teacher's respect and attention to this friend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Su Ge’s age is not public, she thought that Su Ge was a middle-aged man in his 40s and 50s, but he didn’t expect to be one. Young youth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't expect you to take the initiative to find me, thank you very much. Actually, I am going out to visit you." Niya is not a little girl without the market. Although I was surprised, I did not despise the meaning of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled: "I just have time to come and see, Ms. Adeline has helped me when I need help the most, she The thing is my business, and to be honest, I am very curious about where the famous electric queen on the mainland is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listening to the courtesy, Niya shook her head and smiled. "What kind of electric queen is all other people. It is not easy to let go of the church. The electrical revolution of the whole continent is bound to be impossible."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thunderbolt represents the sacred attribute, the two pillars that cure the church today, and the goddess' recognition of the church. The world has not entered the electrical age for many years, mostly because of the healing of the church and the technical blockade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The group of the entire female warlock was listed as a heresy, and the reason for being chased is also because they have the power of lightning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Niya was just finished, he saw Evan, who was admired by the side, and immediately shut up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She knows she has lost her word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is close to the teacher, she can vomit to the bishop, but this student is an outsider, it is not good to pass it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh! Right, Bishop Sotos, please come in, I’m sorry!" Niya looked apologetic and turned her face into her own Apartment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After walking to the living room on the first floor, three people sat on the sofa near the south side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The purpose of your visit this time is to conduct annual steam quota screening?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Niya looked at Evan and nodded: "Yes, this school has a place every year."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Su Ge put his hand on his hand: "Don't get me wrong, I didn't come over the back door. This is Evan. I took him over and just wanted to tell the truth about this quota."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Niya listened very calmly, and grotesquely asked: "Is it the operation of schools and nobles?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Talk about the situation!" Niya said to Evan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan sorts out his thoughts, takes a deep breath, calms his voice, and begins to tell the whole story. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listening to Evan's remarks, Niya nodded and said: "I know the situation here, but in order to ensure fairness, I will listen to the words of Mike Lu and the principal for a comprehensive analysis. I can't believe this one-sided. Words."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, Niya turned to apologetic and looked at Su Ge: "Please understand that I can't let the guild be polluted. This guild is human. Hope is the backbone of technology."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded and said: "I understand, that..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Su Ge was ready to continue, there was a rush of knocking at the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bishop Su Ge, I am Father Harden." It was said that Father Harden’s rough voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug quickly walked over and opened the door, looking at the sturdy Harden asking, "What happened?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hardden's face is ugly, and the voice is short. "The father and son in the north of the city suddenly mutated. I just fled to the school. I heard that the bishop is here, I will come and seek help. The father and son have lost their minds, but they are still wise, very embarrassed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly and turned to look at the two men and said, "You continue to talk, I will go and deal with it first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Su Ge followed Harden and quickly left here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Suge left, Evan was a little nervous, and Niya smiled and waved: "Don’t be nervous, you just said something about the whole thing, now Have time, talk to me about your improvement process, and draw sketch drawings by the way. Is there any difficulty for you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan immediately spirit A shock, his face said with confidence: "Of course!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp In the university, a lot of police and clergymen came here, and they will completely martial law around them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What ability do two people have?" Su Ge asked as he walked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harden’s face is dignified: “Their voices have a special amount of temptation that can easily lead to fear in horror fantasy. At the same time their The body is full of filth, and if they are touched, not only will the body be injured, but even the psionics will be polluted. I already have two sinners, an exorcist, who was injured and sent to the Cathedral of the Holy Blood." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg listened slightly and nodded: "The main attack is spiritual, well, the problem is not big."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Two people in the conversation walked quickly and arrived in front of a teaching building near the northwest side of the campus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The front of the building has gathered more than a dozen clerics, including the scepter, the exorcist, the sacred priest. There are at least 30 police officers in the outer circle and a curious student outside the police. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bishop!" After Su Ge came, more than a dozen people were also saluting at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge took off his hat and handed it to a clergyman and asked, "Is this father and son here?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes! Bishop."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the bustling students look carefully towards this side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look! Look! The rumor is true, Bishop Soge Sotos is really back!" A freshman is excited to point Point inside, say aloud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current popularity of Su Ge among these students is very high and hot. Many of the college students enrolled in August this year are looking up to Su Ge. The name comes in, is to find a chance to witness the legendary bishop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And today, they have fulfilled their wishes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s so young, it doesn’t seem to be my brother," one student said in surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s so handsome! It’s much better than I thought.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few female students on the side looked at Su Ge and had some idiots. Although Su Ge is not very handsome, it is much more handsome than they think. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because in their cognition, the bishop is generally a middle-aged person over forty years old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The temperament is so good, an elegant gentleman's breath, you look at the action of the bowler hat, it is a legendary bishop."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Su Ge asked about the situation, then said: "Give it to me, you are responsible for alerting outside Don't let those students get close, and see something that shouldn't be seen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you finish, you walk into the school building alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Does the bishops go without problems?" asked an exorcist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hardden was also a little bit uncomfortable, but thought that Su Ge had flattened the things in Guinness, and said with a deep heart: "Do not worry, the church does not have The weak bishop."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug went to the lobby on the first floor of the teaching building, surrounded by empty spaces, the students had already ran out, and there was a lot of scattered on the ground. The textbooks of the land, I can see that I was in a hurry when I ran out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! The bells came out and spread rapidly around the center of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire building is a total of five floors, 20 meters high and 60 meters wide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge This evening clock Yu Lan will completely cover the entire half of the entire teaching building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, the wall structure of the entire building, the desks in each room, the podium, and the students who have not had time to run out are all clear. Chu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, I saw two strange monsters, looking at something in a classroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three students’ bodies around the two people, and the remaining one leaning against the corner seems to be shaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
