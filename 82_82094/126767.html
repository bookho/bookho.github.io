			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back in the city, after Suge licked Hills and Bernice, he left the carriage and went home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, Bart gave Suger 1 Langke very intimately to facilitate the explanation to Ada. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next time is very calm, while the two people who are sitting down are sitting in the warm living room, watching their own books, chatting and drinking coffee. Time is warm and cozy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night, Su Ge packed up and went to sleep, and suddenly he screamed, a black crow fell outside his window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crow that Su Ge saw was familiar. After thinking about it, he suddenly remembered that it seemed to be the rook of the night watchman Rogan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hurry open the window and find a letter on the crow's paw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Sugg took the letter, the crow flapped his wings and quickly left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Closed the window with a puzzled face, Su Ge ripped open the envelope and took out the stationery inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white stationery has a vigorous black font. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The letter of Master Gerald?" Su Ge first saw the letter of the letter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The format of the letter is very unique in the style of Gerlos, without the opening greetings, directly into the topic:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Sister Marlene and I said that you are recovering well, and the spirit seems to be better than before. I am very pleased. Having such a tenacious spirit will make you more stable on the road ahead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this letter sent to you by Rogan late at night is very simple. I am leaving. The Green Flame Brotherhood is now responsible for you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!?" Su Ge saw this, his eyes glimpsed, and his face continued to look down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The order from the Holy See at dusk, let me immediately return to the capital tomorrow to prepare for the ceremony of the Archbishop of Rongsheng. Being an archbishop is very important to me. This meaning is more important to me than the lives and deaths of thousands of people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to accept this order and will leave Bain City tomorrow morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have performed very well in the past two months, your bravery and rigor have proved your worth, and your integrity and kindness have saved your life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that you have an unusual identity and deliberately conceal a lot from me, but it doesn't matter, it's important that you are good at confidentiality, cautious, and It is worth believing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;! ! ! ! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that the hair of this Su Ge body was erected, his heart suddenly accelerated and trembled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I lied at that time... Master Geros knew it!" Sug's eyes widened, like Barth's original expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咕噜 swallowed his mouth, and Su Ge calmed himself down through meditation and continued to see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our hunters are not loyal to the church, they are only cooperative relationships. So I have not taken any measures against you, and even paved the way for you to advance, because in the future, I may need your help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cautacy and patience are the best qualities for accomplishing great things, and you have both of these things. What you lack is opportunities and experience. At the same time, your behavior under the church is similar to me, so I can only entrust you to this matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have investigated this whole thing and told a person I believe most in my life. You will take this letter to the Oak House tomorrow to find Michelle. Mrs. Er, she will tell you everything you need and will provide you with the necessary help in solving this problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You seem to be concerned about the witch, I suspect that you may have a relationship with the witch. I don't need to be nervous when I see this. I just want to tell you that if you can handle this thing and make me satisfied, I can tell you enough about the witch when I meet next time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, the little guy, it’s all said. Finally, give you a piece of advice, you can put all your enthusiasm and energy into the church, but don't give your faith and trust to it. Be careful with blood therapy and fear the blood of the ancient gods. ————Jerouss Byron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holding a letter, Su Ge sat on the bed and refused to return to God for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, Su Ge laughed at himself, because these days, his lie that he thought was perfect was actually seen by Gerlos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s really a squad! It’s like a jumping clown." Su Ge thought more and more funny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Self-deprecating a few words, Su Ge will take the letter and sleep in bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sitting on the throne, Su Ge will sort out the contents of the entire letter of Jerouss in detail and draw a lot of points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"First: Gerlos himself is not loyal to the church. He always seems to want to find something through the church, so even if there is a problem in the church. People, as long as they are not harmful to their own interests, will not be easily disclosed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Second: The trustworthy person of Jelos is likely to be church wanted The heresy, otherwise he will not use such a secret way to entrust himself to be a heresy to connect with that person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Third: The witch does exist The hidden truth, from the line between the words of Gerlos, he seems to know very well about the situation and hidden feelings of the witch."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fourth: There is indeed a problem with blood therapy, The red shadow that I saw in the hospital that day was probably the sequela of blood therapy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Last: Gerlos is alone in the church, he I really need to support my own forces to help myself. As long as I perform well enough, he will be very I helped to pave the way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the analysis, Su Ge thought of a possibility: "Does he want to restore his emotions?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The mood of the Demon Hunter was completely suppressed by taking the mutant potion, which is like the transformation of my brain consciousness and instinct. In the dream, I broke the organization of the place with a long gun and let me return to normal. If the magic potter's potion has a similar structure, I should be able to help him solve the emotional problem in his dreams."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
