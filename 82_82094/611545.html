			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The masked party stopped in a weird way. I don’t know how Albert and Macock worked, and the people present did not cause too much ripples. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there are no waves, it does not mean that they have forgotten those nightmares. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people know very well that there is no point in making trouble here, and that the cult has been expelled by the hero, then there is nothing to fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is more interesting is that as a hero of everyone, Drake seems to be in a coma because he is too weak, and has not recovered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The confidentiality of the incident was very good. Others who did not attend the ball only felt the hull of the ship violently shaking, and then did not think much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the loss is still huge, 14 people who participated in the evil ritual prayer, 12 people became flesh-and-blood monsters, and the rest are two Ms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One is Miss Mary, who was rescued by Su Ge, and the other is Miss Angie, who is the sexy woman in red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except these twelve people, and six brave young men died under the magic of Marchi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, seven passengers were missing, a total of eighteen people who went crazy because of the skyrocketing spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be said that the impact and loss of the event has been enormous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s okay, everyone knows, because of the status, they know exactly what position behind the cruise, so no one is threatening And actively leaked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Macock has requested assistance, and all problems can be resolved after arriving at the Imperial Capital. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is very satisfied with how Macock and Albert are handled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sixth day of sailing, ten o'clock in the morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the last day of sailing. At this time tomorrow, the cruise has arrived at the Port of Tedu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second floor cafe, elegant private room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge leaned on the chair, cocked his legs, and tasted the bitter high-concentration coffee. He said plainly: "I like coffee, because after bitterness, you can People find peace and quiet, which is very similar to life. If you want to get something, you have to pay something first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sitting opposite Su Ge Is an expert female warlock, Ms. Iyeta. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This mature female warlock is very nervous, and the delicate makeup reveals the old age brought by some ages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was sitting on the sofa and did not dare to move, the back was wet with sweat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coffee in front of it exudes a touch of steam, with a strong aroma, just knowing that it is a good coffee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, she did not dare to taste this cup of coffee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Su Ge’s remarks, Iyeta used all his experience for many years, trying to calm down the nervous inner heart, quietly taking a deep breath, she came out He said: "If you want to get it, you must first give up some things. This is very simple, but many people can't see it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stop, she is very Seriously looking at Su Ge: "Fortunately, I have already seen it when I was young."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge puts down the coffee, the dark eyes are full It is a deep god, like the infinite darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being stared at this pair of eyes, Iyeta’s body tightened instantly, and the inner feeling felt tremendous pressure, even temporarily breathing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three seconds later, Su Ge smiled slightly: "The way to be willing is to recognize your first step, the insatiable person is doomed to be a big event."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iytaton sighed and smiled and nodded and said, "You are right."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge went on to say: "On the whole boat, there were thirty-one mysterious people at the beginning, but now there are only five left. My original plan is to prepare the remaining four."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iyeta heard this moment of breathing, his face pale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She knows deeply who these five people are, and it is clear that the four people that Su Ge wants to stay are not themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you have been kneeling on the ground to make a tortoise until the end of the matter, then the people who are missing on the ship are not seven, but eight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iyeta listened to the fists under the sleeves and slowly squeezed, and the heart thumped and fluttered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is well aware that the seven missing people are mysterious, but seem to be some cult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people are not at the venue, but in their own rooms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, after the end of the matter, the seven people disappeared like a singularity, and no one knew where they went, it was life or death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Thank you for your kindness.” Ieta’s incomparable solemnity is full of respect and sincerity, and the tone is one word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge doesn’t care about her thanks: “The way to be willing is very interesting. Because willingness is not an equivalent exchange, something is doomed to be equivalent to exchange. For example, love."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, there are many things that can be exchanged for equivalence, such as life. The truth of killing people since ancient times is well known." Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Ieta’s forehead suddenly oozes a lot of fine sweat, and falls down the forehead and brows, and makes up the makeup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s words are awkward, but they are straightforward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I spared you a life, you have to give me the equivalent of your life now, otherwise I don't mind taking back my kindness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this naked threat, Ieta does not have any courage to resist, nor does it have any slickness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is very aware of the horror of the couple in front of her, and she is more aware of the viciousness of the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If she has any resistance now, she knows she can’t get out of this box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his "missing" will not cause any waves, even his body will be handled by the captain of the ship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, if there are still corpses at the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She thought, concealing the glamorous woman who sat down and sipped her milk tea and never talked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know who is fearless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the contrary, the more you know, the more you know how to fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her inspiration tells herself that this beautiful and fascinating woman is more dangerous and scarier than this man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inspiration of the mystery is on the one hand, more is the intuition of being a woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a female warlock who is unscrupulous for her goal, she deeply knows the phrase "the most poisonous woman". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A full meditation for a minute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the longest silence she has had for many years, because she has not been silent for so long as a mature and knowledgeable female warlock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, although she is still a female warlock, she is more of an ordinary person, she wants to live. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with your own life, the so-called restoration of the country goes to hell! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tick! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A drop of rouge sweat fell on the black skin of the sofa, leaving a flesh-colored stain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
