			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge still stood on the wall, but his eyes did not look down, but looked at the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sky, he is extra familiar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the darkness of the sky, there is a round of white, like a jade-like moon, with other twinkling stars around the moon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No clouds, no smog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looks at the sky a bit embarrassed because it is the night sky of the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clean moon, the splendid galaxy, the quiet night, the people who look inside are broad and calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you looking at?" A voice broke this quiet night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge didn’t think much, calmly replied: “This reminds me of my hometown.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Is there only one moon in your hometown?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, there..." Su Ge still wants to continue to answer, but his heart suddenly chills. , I will return to God in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the sound, just seeing wearing a black robe, Shirley with a mask is standing beside him, his dark eyes are interested Look at yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger fierce and then back two steps, the cloak instantly opened, with Su Ge floating in the air as warning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s not the first time I met, how so scared? I won’t eat you again.” Shelly said with some dissatisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug slowly fell back to the ground, his face cautiously replied: "Who knows if you will eat me, after all, you just put the whole The city has eaten."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is called eating? This is called gestation!" Xue Lier said with a sharp eyebrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge looked around and although the whole city had been shrouded in black, the intensity of the light stayed at dusk, not dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle below is still going on. It seems that neither side has invested too much energy because of the sudden changes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Randall?!" Su Ge suddenly found Randall missing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shelly pointed her finger at the wall and said: "It’s too much trouble, let me kick it down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Sug hurriedly turned around and saw that Randall was lying on the ground at this time, and it should be fainted.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, Higher vampires will not die like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Improved Randall was not eaten by this old monster. Su Ge looked at her and asked: "You have scrapped such a big week, what do you want to do?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge can feel that this huge egg does not seem to have any negative effect on the coalition, and there is not much attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the mask of Shirley came a chuckle: "There is a lot to do, and the core point is naturally to cut off someone's thoughts." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what only Su Ge knows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear that the core role of the black goat's egg is to prevent the descending of the Sog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge listened to his face: "The person who robbed Gerlos was really you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "It's me." Shirley generously admitted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s eyes burned with ice blue and said: “Then you should be very clear about my identity.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, even clearer than yourself." Sherry's natural answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she finished, she was somewhat upset: "When you put away your wolf fire, who is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge’s eyes twitched slightly, and it’s only when he thinks that Shirley is similar to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, the fire of Su Ge’s spirit is gradually extinguished, and a cough sighs to ease the embarrassing atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That...what do you want to do?" Su Ge asked some uncomfortable pinch of his cane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shelly took a look at Su Ge and said to the two sides fighting in the city: "Nature is the Holy Grail."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But the Holy Grail is impossible for humans to pick up," said Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley’s faint remark: “Am I human?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“...” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you human?" Sherry continued to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug just wants to open his mouth and talk, Xue Lier warned: "If you want to know your identity, say it is wrong, there will be punishment."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s lips squirmed and finally remained silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's we know before?" Silence for a few seconds, Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley sneered, didn't speak, seemed to be quite resentful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looked at Shirley’s side face and suddenly felt a feeling of deja vu on Shelly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You want the Holy Grail, I also want the Holy Grail. By the same token, you should kill me without hesitation, after all, there is only one Holy Grail." Su Ge said calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Shirley’s dark long hair is like a life, like a snake squirming on Su Ge’s cheek: “What? Want to die?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge spread his hand: “Of course I don’t want to, just want to figure out something.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you want to understand something, it will cost you." Shirley sat lightly on the edge of the city wall and patted the position beside him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looked at the black head that was still licking his face, sitting squatting, the two sitting on the wall less than ten centimeters from the back Looking at the past, it seems like a couple looking up at the stars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, this can't be a couple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Su Ge is full of strength, and his hand is pinching his cane, as if he is an enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley is very relaxed swinging his legs, looking at the two sides who killed and killed, faintly asked: "You are not curious who I am? ?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge calmly replied: "I will understand this matter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She glanced at Su Ge and didn't know what her expression was. She continued: "The shell of the Holy Grail has been fixed. Now it can be started with enough content. However, if the Holy Grail is really solid, it requires three conditions." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Which three?" Su Ge asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"First: The blood of the blood of Byron the Great."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Second: To have A skeleton that fits well is a support."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Third: Have the will to synchronize enough as the core."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge heard these three conditions, his brow was locked, and he fell into deep meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These three conditions, only the first one he can understand, the other two he does not understand what it means. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley seems to know that Su Ge doesn’t understand, so he continues: “The content is the soul and flesh of these people. The skeleton that is enough to pray is a certain A skull. The will to be synchronized is in front of your eyes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge listened to his expression, and suddenly thought about what this synchronization means. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So his eyes fell on the giant emperor who was fighting Laurie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are not stupid." Shelly nodded slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug turned to look at her: "Why tell me this? Don't you want to get the Holy Grail?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley nodded slightly: "I certainly want to get it, but there are many ways to get it. It doesn't have to be in the hands of the Holy Grail."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Su Ge listened to silence, he did not trust Shirley, and even faint hostility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But yesterday, Ada’s words were in his ear, so he now chooses to trust Shirley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he stood up and prepared to walk down the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl said: "As before, any intelligence comes at a price. In the near future, you will meet you in your life. The biggest trouble, even directly threatening your life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge looked down at Shirley and said confidently: "If you don't want to kill In my words, no one here can kill me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that, Su Ge flew directly down the wall to see Randall's situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shelly looked at Su Ge’s back and said with a smile: "I don't want to kill you, but when you get the Holy Grail, there are many people who want to To kill you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, the body turned into a black mist and disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the city wall, when Su Ge helped Randall, he found that the bones and internal organs of the old vampire had completely recovered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wake it up, Randall’s frightened said: "Adult, I just made a very scary dream."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled: "All passed, let's go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where?" asked Randall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looks forward and says: "The Royal Palace Dungeon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the battlefield, at this time The fighting was extremely fierce, and the reduction of the number of employees on both sides has exceeded more than half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coalition is now only alive with more than twenty people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Byron Dias, there is only one giant emperor left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the five-eyed hunter was dead at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Father is still calm at this time, and seems to have not experienced any battle, but there are many bloody patterns in the books in his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "End!" The Holy Father said calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time the Giant Emperor is still full of momentum, his four faces are full of calm and calm, said faintly: "Yes, it should be over."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he finished, his wings slammed open, his hands twitched a few words, and sighed: "Great ancestors, the source of humanity, the origin of wisdom, dreams The emperor, listen to the call of your son, receive the sacrifice of this soul!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Generate wisdom from the hybrid, birth will from the void, from the frenzy Birth form, the great holy grail of the soul, show it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boom rumble...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The giant emperor sang at the same time as the four heads, and the entire imperial city suddenly trembled violently. Then the entire imperial city was like an earthquake. The ground slammed open and the houses around it collapsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of the surrounding bodies flashed a burst of indescribable radiance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a huge void, the gradual rise from the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This shadow is huge and looks like a few hundred meters high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
