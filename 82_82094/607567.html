			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marki standing in the body of a flesh-and-blood monster stared at Su Ge and smiled: "Yes, it is a curse. Your combat power is really strong, killing people." It is also very efficient. If you join the church, you should be able to become a leader who will be afraid of bloody moons."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, if you are really strong enough If you can, you can kill all of these people, because at this moment, all of them will be my servants!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, Marchi The gods are proudly laughing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge is still calm at this time, not even looking at those crazy people, the eyes are still staring at Marchi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Marchi was relaxed and relaxed, and his face was winning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a burst of barking like a beast, the whole people suddenly had a huge riot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The totally crazy people have lost their senses, and their only goal now is to shred and kill all the things in front of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because in their worldview, the existence of themselves other than themselves has become a horrible monster to kill themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kill! Take out your knowledge and shake these people into flesh!" Marchi was very happy at this moment, and his body was light and hiding in the crowd. , arrogant and ridiculous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert took Mary and hurried to the side of Su Ge, pale, and asked with a sweat: "What should I do? Will die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge turned slightly and looked at the people who started to shake in the crowd, casually said: "Nothing, I am a Psychologist, I am very good at these people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hahaha! Psychologist? It’s really a big laugh." Marchi’s voice came again. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This fog will eventually dissipate, and then the servant of the true God will tear you up instantly. You! There is no way to live!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing aside Shirley’s hands clasped her chest and said, “Hurry and solve, this bug is too annoying.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Suge stepped forward and took a deep breath Tooth, he said aloud: "Everyone listens to me, I am a psychologist. Everyone has something to say, don't fight, don't be fooled by cultists!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Ha ha ha ha!" When he heard Su Ge, Malkiton laughed and laughed, as if he heard the world's best laughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't say that Albert is a ghost-like expression, even Mary, who is an ordinary person, feels that Su Ge is a bit ridiculous at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking reasonably with a group of totally crazy people? Was this man's head kicked by a horse? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Markey laughed at the tears at this moment, smirked and said: "I really overestimate you, you actually say such a ridiculous naive words? You Is it really a master mystery!? No beginners can say such ridiculous remarks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug did not speak, his mouth was a bit strange The smile looked at her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of this smile, Marki felt a little wrong inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afterwards, a special atmosphere made her heart tremble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because at this moment, she felt that the situation was a bit uncomfortable, and those with a madness gasping could not hear it at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An extremely unpleasant feeling spread in her heart, so she turned her own stiff neck and turned to look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, I just saw that a group of crazy beasts actually looked at themselves in clear eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What!????" Seeing this scene, Malki’s body jumped up like a wild-haired wild cat with a shocked face. And incredible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just the beasts that are completely crazy, the eyes are muddy and chaotic, have disappeared. At this time, these people have clear eyes. Although they have some doubts and weird faces on their faces, they feel that they just want to lose their memories, but they are really stunned. Has been restored to a normal person! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is impossible!" Marchie, the boss of his eyes, shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a relaxed expression of Su Ge: "Everyone is a cultural elite, it is easy to talk about the channel. You see, everyone has returned to normal. "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃呃呃..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aside from the mouth of Albert The chin is almost detached, and the people who are returning to normal in front of them are stupidly looking blank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know who is fearless, and Albert is showing how exaggerated it is because he knows how terrible the blame is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is familiar with history books, and there have been several times in the history of the scourge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time it was used by a cultist, directly swindled thousands of soldiers who went to crusade against them. The soldiers killed each other, one did not live, and left The legend of terror is underway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second scourge appeared in a colonial ship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When people found the colonial ship, the whole ship was full of blood and internal organs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the people on board are killing each other like wild animals, consuming the flesh and blood of each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the third and fourth time, each appearance caused huge casualties and terror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows a master of psychology who has been studying the scourge of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to his research results, the sorrowful language is to suppress the human reason completely by some kind of mimicking the language of the gods, and to greatly enlarge the animal nature and produce temperament. Flip. This flip is almost irreversible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
