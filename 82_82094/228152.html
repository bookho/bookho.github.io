			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At 11:10, two people rushed to the site of the incident, an abandoned cotton factory on the outskirts of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The factory has been abandoned for two years, due to the winter just passed, surrounded by snow outside the dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Roland, two people jumped in from the factory wall and came to the factory yard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The southeast side of the compound, Ishii, is where the dead jumped into the well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How did you find him at the beginning?" Su Ge had some surprises when he saw such a hidden self-killing method. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland explained: "It’s also quite a coincidence. When he came here sneaking, he was just seen by a patrolman. The patrolman thought he was coming. If he steals something, he secretly follows behind him. After seeing him, he seems to be whispering something to the side of the well, then jumps out with his arms."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge opened the vision and looked around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no mystery around, from the previous footprints, as Roland said, the two steps came in one after the other, from the footprints The distance and depth are very normal, there is no sign of coercion killing and corpse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, Suge spreads psionics, turns Looked at the well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wellhead is almost two meters wide and about 15 meters deep. The water below has melted a part, and it really drowns people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I heard that you have the ability to communicate with the soul, can you sense his soul?" Roland asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge feels it carefully, and does not feel the soul. What he can feel is just a touch of ease and joy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of feeling is very clear to him, it is the remnant of his time when the soul is freed after the soul is over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Roland, he really committed suicide. I can feel the joy and ease of the soul. He is similar to Macock, and he has obtained self-confidence and redemption through suicide." Su Ge got the conclusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, Roland’s eyes gradually widened: “How is this possible? Is it not tempted by other people or hypnotized by any mysterious person?”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge shook his head: "It’s not clear yet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland pinches his fist, she never believes Macock is suicide, this is the driving force she has been investigating, but now...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because suicide can also achieve self-salvation, this is very Strange." Su Ge touched his chin and suddenly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a matter of two times. From the current situation, so many people who have recently committed suicide may be like this. Who gave them What hints are implanted in the spirit?” Su Ge’s heart is constantly thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland is a little annoyed at this moment, and the adventure has brought in Su Ge and has not yet got effective information, which is quite different from what she expected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland fists squatting at the wellhead, biting his teeth: "How could this be!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This The boxing is very heavy, you can see the blood flowing down the fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug helped her shoulder and sighed: "Okay, don't worry. This thing will be checked sooner or later."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rolanden snorted and raised his hand and rubbed the blood on his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪嗒! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Roland raised her hand, she suddenly fell by a stone in her wellhead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The otherwise ordinary stone has caught the attention of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he found a gray line under the stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this line is not brand new, it is not too long, it seems to be painted for about two weeks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug immediately stepped forward with his cane to pry the other stones nearby. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A moment, a gray rune appeared in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is...Karding Rune." Seeing this rune, Su Ge immediately recognized it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Calder Rune is based on the advanced runes above thirty-three Keynes runes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty-three Keynes runes symbolize the elements of the foundation, and the Calder Rune symbolizes the composition of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Su Ge’s eccentric rune consisting of nine waves is the “river” in Calding’s runes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this, Su Ge’s eyes suddenly tightened and asked: "Roland, do you know the location of suicides by other suicides? Fast!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Know!" Roland feels that Su Ge has clues here and immediately tells the names of the past 13 suicides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge closed his eyes and marked the thirteen positions on the map in his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, the entire suicide incident is clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The calculated Macock, these fifteen points constitute a simple circle. This array is like two funnels that cross each other. In the middle of the city, the Maccock, which died in the Church of the Holy Blood, is the central node, which covers the entire city of Bain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is Luke's mention of the framework! It only takes a total of seventeen points to complete, and now it's two worse!" Su Ge's eyes sparkled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, you seem to know too much, little guy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, A low, hoarse voice came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg instantly regained his spirit and turned to look around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who!!" Roland pulled out the gun instantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know when, four people are coming around and are slowly approaching here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four men are dressed in neat black robes and can’t see it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will shoot again when I move again!" Roland warned nervously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the four people still have not stopped and move on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gunshot, a bullet shot directly at the chest of the black man in front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the next second, Roland widened his eyes and looked horrified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because I only saw that person raised his hand and easily blocked the bullet of the steel, it was like picking up a throwing stone, or throwing it at the child. That kind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪嗒! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing such a strange phenomenon, Roland’s discovery of his own vision suddenly grew two points, from three to five. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is ignorant humans still want to use this low-level thing to hurt our noble body?" The man said, the body gradually became transparent, in Roland's field of vision Disappear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge stepped forward and squeezed the cane: "Close your eyes, and then the 18th ban."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland heard this humorous words, and the heart that was just frightened by the growth of the vision gradually subsided, and spit out: "I am 28 years old this year."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, I still close my eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Little priest, you know what you shouldn't know." At this time, the four ghouls have faded away from intellectual camouflage and become four bodies. Strong, skin ulcerated, with sly claws and mouth full of big teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
