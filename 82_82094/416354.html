			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the church, Su Ge came to Ivan's chapel with Evan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time I saw Ivan’s fierce debate with several clergy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened?" Su Ge came over and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivan said with an angry look: "This group of superficial guys have to cut down on my research materials and funding, saying that my invention has no meaning, it is a waste. The property of the church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Sug turned to look at the face with a proud cleric: "This is the bishop of Nell. Command?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This clergyman is about 35 or 6 years old and is a professional-level priest. He looks like a normal body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This clergyman gave a slight salute and nodded: "Yes, the personal order of the Bishop of Nell."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;He is proud of his face, his expression is calm, his self-sustaining is very high, and he has the temperament of the uncle of Nell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking out, this guy has been completely brainwashed by Nell’s theory of “the high official is on the top”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are a polite guy!" Ivan continued to yell with dissatisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This clergyman said faintly: "Pay attention to your words, Ivan. Strictly speaking, you are not a normal cleric, you are only responsible for the internal affairs. Ordinary people, there is no difference between those who send letters."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivan listened to his face red, but also talked, but was stopped by Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned to look at the priest who is very consistent with Nell's temperament: "Know it, retire."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An understatement of a word with an unquestionable majesty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clergyman still wants to say something, but sees the pair of dark eyes looking at himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this dark and deep eyes like an abyss, the clerics’ mouths that have just opened are suddenly in the throat and can’t speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In silence, he bowed and took the person and turned away quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The side of Evan looked at Su Ge at this time, and his heart was full of surprise: "Sure enough, I and Su Ge are not a world person." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the ugly departure of the clergyman, Ivan seems to be a child who is a brother, and his expression is both excited and happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, Ivan, help me prepare a five-ring array, and gold, iron, secret silver, gas, birds, sheep... sixteen Cairns Rune." Su Ge took off his shirt and said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivan first nodded and then asked: "What is this going to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The basic sacrificial contract law, Evan has a worm that has not yet formed a blood curse, I will send it back." Su Ge said freely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan and Ivan are also old acquaintances, and at this time they roll up their sleeves to reveal the disgusting red blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivan looked at it and said: "This is not very easy? This thing seems to need plague flowers, dragon snake green grass, sacral flower as the core material. These materials are not cheap, I don't have them here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan listened to see some tangles to Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg picked up the chalk and said, "Don't worry, I'm ready for the material, first draw."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ivan did not hesitate to listen, followed by Su Ge to prepare for the squad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five-ring array is a lot more complicated, plus the correct sequence of sixteen runes, two people have been completed three hours later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the completion of the squad, Su Ge gestured to Evan to take off his shirt and lie in the center of the squad, then stretched his left arm up and remained still. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivan looked at the empty Su Ge and asked: "There is no material, this array is of no use."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know, although there is no such material, But I have enough substitutes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, Su Ge burned an ice blue flame on his right hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold flame is transformed from the green flame of the external god Turz, which has a very high purity of the original life energy, known as the original fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After being transformed, although the form presented changes, its essence still exists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This flame has the highest level of mysterious media, and can replace many mysterious materials in the array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is the situation with this flame?" Feeling a cold, Ivan asked unexpectedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug did not speak, the two cold flame elves flew out, and under the inspiration of Su Ge, they ordered a small group on the sixteen Keynes runes. Cold flames. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Evan, close your eyes, no matter what you hear, see what you feel, don't blink your eyes, don't respond." Su Ge stood Seriously said before the ruling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan was a little nervous at the moment, but still nodded hard: "Understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequent Close your eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s hands clasped together and whispered the relevant prayer spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he bends down and puts his hands on the edge of the rim, putting a lot of psionics into it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hula! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flames on the sixteen Keynes runes suddenly rose, as if they were blown by the wind, constantly dancing around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the midst of it, an indescribable shadow gradually enveloped the entire legal system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the bloody blood of Evan's hand squirmed, like the nausea of ​​the mouth of the shell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Send enough sacrifices to you, and return the things you ask for from ignorant ignorant people. Please lower your forgiveness and take back your greatness. Authoritative." Su Ge said loudly, the flames around him quickly evaporated, turning into a burst of steam into the bloody countless mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood then slowly separated from Evan’s arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be seen that during the process of detachment, a large number of slender red tentacles are drawn from the pores of Evan's arm and become bloody feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, a whisper that Su Ge couldn’t hear was ringing in the squad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inside of Evan seems to have heard something, the eyes under the eyes not only turn, but even the expression is still frightened, several times the mouth is to open, But fortunately, he remembered Su Ge’s advice. During the whole process, there was no blinking, no opening, no response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After about ten minutes, after all the bloody flames had eaten all the cold flames, it seemed to be very satisfying and lost interest in Evan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the shadow of the air, gradually squeezing out something invisible, entangled blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bloody sputum slowly fell into the top of the house, disappearing completely, and the shadow of the entire chapel disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge spit out a sigh of relief and used the psionics to check to make sure that the entire connection has completely disappeared. Stand up and say, "Okay, how is it?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan opened his eyes and looked up at his normal arm. He took a deep breath and said, "Comfortable, it seems that the heavy load that has been carried away has been removed. The whole body is a lot lighter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug went over and pulled him up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can see that the blood covered by the bloody arm is full of dark blood, the skin of the whole arm is somewhat ulcerated, and even some rancid taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go, go and deal with the arm first," Su Ge said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge said, taking Evan to find Father Hank in the medical district. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This time you are lucky, the source of your curse is not too strange. After you have eaten, you will leave with satisfaction. You may I don't know, there are a lot of people who will take away some of the user's organs and even the limbs as a punishment for him after taking away the best."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear this Evan There is a lingering fear in my face: "It’s okay to meet you, otherwise I’m afraid that the family will not know what it is because of the death.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You will rarely touch this aspect in the future. As your steam genius. I will try my best to help you with this quota."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Su Ge has a hint of suffocation on his face: "Dare to bully my brother's head, I see you are really tired!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing this, Evan’s heart suddenly warmed and shook his head: This is not..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing?" Su Ge’s eyes glimpsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it is academic, you lose to others, then you are convinced, and try hard to get in. What is this? Not only grabbed you The result, will you break your future, or use this despicable nepotism? Well! They want to use this method to get you, let us get back, I see who is powerful!" Su Ge looks confident, Said the tone of domineering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Evan, don't have any burden on the heart. Let's never bully people, don't bully people, don't do the tricks of stealing chickens and dogs. But who wants to be like this? The idea is to hit us, then don't blame us for being unkind!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge has suffered countless such insults and injustices on the earth, then he unable to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power is now in the grip and the status is high. Through the Evan, the anger and unhappiness that was buried in the heart have all been awakened and turned into raging anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
