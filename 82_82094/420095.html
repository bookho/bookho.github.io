			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the permission of Su Ge, Adeline’s heart suddenly fell to the ground and looked relaxed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the situation in the Imperial Capital?" Su Ge asked Bernice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, Bernice said with a positive look: "It’s more complicated. With the return of Guinness, many nobles are eager to move towards it. The father of one of my good sisters is a Marquis of the capital."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh?" Su Ge heard this look a little unexpected, in Berrant The capital of this great empire has the title of the Marquis, but it has enormous power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adeline introduced: "The Marquis name is Green Glass."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Glass? I seem to have some impressions." Su Ge’s memory faintly heard the name from the book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh! It’s the Admiral Grasse? The textbook says that twenty years ago, he led the fleet to sweep away all the pirates on the Pearl Sea next to the Empire. Empty, and even repelled the invading Vikula's Ghost Fleet, wounded the sea creatures that he summoned and brought back a tentacle of the sea monster."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Aideline smiled and said: "Yes, this is General Grasse. He is not only an outstanding military strategist and politician, but also a master captain. He uses his own Mysterious knowledge can make your own boat alive, like a creature's breathing and activities."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge looks at Bernice with an accident and approval: "This is a big man. How do you know his family's daughter?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bennie smiled at her lips: "His baby daughter is called Cui West Grasse. She admires her father’s identity as a mystery, but the Marquis is very concerned about her baby daughter, no She was in contact with mystery. About a few months ago, Tracy was induced by the cold-hearted church ghoul and almost became a sacrifice. It happened that I was secretly tracking the ghoul and saved her. It has gradually become a good sister."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His father doesn't know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Marquis knows, I have seen it twice, but it has not stopped. I also took the opportunity to formally enter a more advanced circle." Bernice said this, with a happy face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adeline praised: "Now, Bernice is a famous flower of the North in the young lady circle, and many noble boys are sharpened. The head is close to her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug immediately gave him a very satisfied applause: "Better done, Bernice, seeing you grow like this, I can feel the joy and satisfaction of the Lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;British is more happy after listening, and my heart is full of unprecedented satisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What information did you get there?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bennis nodded and said: "I occasionally listened to Cui Xi a few days ago, some nobles are ready to apply through the church, send people to stay there, fight for The market is on the one hand, they want to use it as a springboard to enter the night scene and the storm plateau. After all, those two places are treasures that the nobles can't reach for many years."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge brows one pick: "Oh!? This is not easy. The night is not only the high vampire family, but also the old king of the old king and the undead knight. The storm plateau is the twin league. Place, the blood of the twins covers the entire area."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh!" Speaking of this, Bernice’s eyes flashed and seemed to think of something. Immediately said: "The Pope, referring to the black blood, I suddenly thought of an important piece of information."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A trophy of the Marquis of Grasse was stolen, that It is a fifth-order secret treasure called "the sacrifice of blood." It absorbs the blood of human beings. Different powers, rumors can control the blood of human whole body. The clue is that the thief seems to have been attracted to some kind of "salted blood" to the city of Bain."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The fifth-order secret treasure!?" Su Ge heard some accidents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secret level is also based on the visual system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not that the spirit can’t see it, but the spirit can’t see it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secret treasure is similar to the Holy Grail file and may be anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oliver’s "The Book of the Undead", Ron's "The Praise of the Megaphage" is a secret treasure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Book of the Undead requires 30 points to see the content. The "praise of the giant worm" takes sixty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The skull of the Green Flame was a four-level secret treasure, which required at least 40 points to be used. And that black glove is a fifth-order secret treasure, which requires fifty points of vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But these two things have special characteristics, and they are bound by the cold heart of Su Ge, so they break the rigid demand of the vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gloves left by the Dark Son are already strong enough, and this "sacred sacrifice" is actually at the same level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benice said: "The Marquis's men have already departed to Bain City yesterday. If you can, you can help them and get their friendship. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded and said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adeline added: "Recently because of the problems of the witches, the mysterious world seems to have some strange fluctuations, according to my sister-in-law The news, Bain City seems to have gathered a lot of mysterious people, they seem to be looking for clues related to the witch."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Their goal is Bay Encheng?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“No, it’s a more northerly place, and I don’t know exactly which one.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded: "I know, the two performed very well. This information is very important to the church. The two did not expect the Lord."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your approval, Your Majesty!" said the two at the same time humbly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What else is there? If you don't have time, go to rest!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benny Silk shook his head and said that he did not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aideline thought about it, some hesitantly said: "Your Majesty, this is my personal business, I am not too embarrassed to say it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You and me are The believer of the Lord, your business is my business, but it does not matter." Su Geping said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adeline nodded: "One of my students, also a female warlock, is also a mechanical expert. She is the middle of the mechanical union. One year. The selection of a steam union started, she should go to Bain City tomorrow. But the situation in Bain City is a bit dangerous now, so I hope that you can take care of her a little, she is just a professional female warlock, and knowledge and Not in combat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge did not immediately agree, nor refused, and binocular Gujing had no wave of contemplation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aideline immediately added: "She has a lot of room for development in the steam union in the future, and can win many talents and benefits for the church."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Su Ge nodded slightly: "Although the Lord is kind, but his kindness is not everyone's qualification, I believe in your vision, believe in you. Loyalty to the Lord, Ms. Adeline.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Thank you for your trust in me, thank you for your kindness to the humble.” Adeline Seriously said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tell me her name and where she left."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is called Nepal Ya Tesla is a female warlock who is rare to master lightning. She will live in an independent apartment prepared by her at Bain University. Since she has not yet joined the church, I venture to say that you are mine. Friend."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s mouth showed a smile and nodded slightly: “Yes, take a break!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open your eyes, Sug sees Lobo's clumsy dog ​​planing in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to like playing with water, and the happy expression is full of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get out of the bath and wipe your body clean, and collect important information from Bernice and Adeline in Su Ge's mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Guinness needs to strengthen political management and hand it over to Vanas. Marquis Grasse is relatively important. He not only masters the navy, but also masters the mysterious power. He is seventy years old today. In the forty-five years of the Southern Expedition to the Northern War, the five-level secret treasure that made countless mysterious people are actually the trophies stored. Just relying on Bernice can not catch the big fish, if I really met, help one It’s not a problem.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;” Adeline said that this time it’s a mysterious change, so the scale is much larger than the last few organizations, and The scope is relatively scattered. It is very likely that many people are single-handed combat, and the Lone Ranger will go after the completion. This should pay attention to some."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The last is this Niya Tesla, just in time, can solve Evan's affairs through her hands, lest I go to make some very rude, threatening behaviors that are unfortunately gentle."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lying in bed, Su Ge is very satisfied with the work of these two: It’s true that the development was separate. I have time to find Randall and Hills to learn about the night scene!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Speaking from me It’s been a year since the first call has been made. How can no one else summon me again? I also intend to collect more believers from different regions and learn as much as possible about the truth of the world.”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No matter, let it be!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, Suge sat up for his own meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blessing of the lake's streaks has allowed Su Ge's spiritual power to grow tremendously. Every lingering growth will be turned into a fivefold effect through the expansion of the sacred mark, which makes Su Ge very eager for meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, psionics are not spiritual, certainly more and better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning breakfast, Prince Jean reported his results yesterday. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His task is to find those who have witnessed the soul of Su Ge, invite them to the development of Guinness through the church of the late bell, and formally join the evening clock. church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The whole process went smoothly. Thirteen of them visited yesterday. After hearing the war in Guinness, the church was filled with worship. After being invited, I was ecstatic and ready to transfer to the north." Jean said with pleasure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
