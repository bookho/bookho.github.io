			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stepping on the air standing in the air, Su Ge raised his hand slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The countless fogs and ghosts gathered to become a huge ghost throne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the adoration of countless people, Sug sat on the empty sky, and the eyes under the mask looked down at the many believers and said, "Chuck." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately, step out of a tall and majestic knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He strode to everyone and said in a loud voice: "According to the Pope, Suger Sotos’s words, and after receiving the Lord’s approval, The church structure of the late bell is as follows."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All of a sudden, everyone raised their ears and listened carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Vanas Guinness!" Chuck whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas got up lightly and squatted on the ground: "The servant is here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Check Kr. said: "Vanas self-understood some of the power of the Lord, and offered everything and high devoutness. According to Su Ge Sotos, from now on, you will become the new Pope of the Church of the Late Bell. The whole church, to help my people and people, spread my body to every corner of the world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this order, the people below were somewhat surprised. But there is no objection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of Gerald, Randall or Hills, at this moment, it’s instinctively think that Vanas is more effective than Sug The pope's gas field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge in the sky waved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A burst of darkness accompanied by countless golden radiance descended from the sky, wrapping the vagina of Vanas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the comments of the people, the two perfectly merged with the long skirts of Vanas, forming a royal robes of noble luxury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a black background, it is covered with delicate and perfect golden lines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The robes are perfectly attached to her body, extending two towering collars upwards and a pair of wing-like shoulders, and a slender skirt that extends underneath put. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The perfect royal robes given by God, perfectly show her perfect figure and the high cold and noble temperament. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The golden brilliance continues to condense, and finally a golden luxury four-corner crown is formed on the top of her thick hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you for the gift of my lord, even if the servant is broken, he will not disappoint the hope of my Lord!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Once again, Vanas put his hands on the abdomen and carefully backed back to his original position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chuck went on to say: "The Pope is the executor of my will. And the will to execute my Lord naturally requires the help of my apostles."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Pope is a apocalypse apostle who has inherited the four forces of my Lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Four Great Apocalypse The apostles ruled the four core structures of the Holy See, the two chambers, and the two chambers. They are: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Glen Valley: The distant valley symbolizes the endless wisdom and thoughts of the Lord. Responsible for the scientific research and development and logistics supply of the entire church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White Cream Court: The blazing hoarfrost represents the Lord’s cold and violent enthusiasm for the enemy, the military group responsible for the entire church, the annihilation of cults, and the expansion of the territory. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;晨钟庭: The gentle morning bell symbolizes the Lord's love and mercy, is responsible for spreading the love and glory of the Lord, is responsible for salvation, and is hostaged by persecution. There are few masters, including not limited to witches, female warlocks, werewolves, undead, vampires, hunters, and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaves of the Bell: The death knell that sounds when the dead occupies the Lord’s divine power and theocracy, is responsible for annihilating a major threat to the church, sneaking into the church, and provoking the Lord The enemy of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Appointed Gerlos Byron as the apostle of war for my master, in charge of the White Frost Court, with the power of my hunter, conquering the enemy, destroying the cult To open up the soil for the church!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Imported Mason Water to be the death apostle of my lord, in charge of the mourning bell, with the power of my lord to eliminate hidden dangers, kill the threat, and promote my lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two people, stepped forward."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are different forms, but the imposing priests Gerlos and Waterer come forward at the same time, 跪Under the throne of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge raised his hand and waved, and then the two people’s robes and armor showed a beautiful pattern of wildfire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attire and weapon become more real and more awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for the gift of my Lord, swear to live up to my expectations!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The development progress and the lack of suitable manpower, the Glen Valley and the morning bell are temporarily unsupervised, and the people of my masters can work hard to express themselves and strive to be my apocalyptic apostles!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything, everyone’s eyes are bright and full of hope<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Under the four apocalyptic apostles, there are eight storm archbishops, the storm archbishop A group of two people, directly led by the Apocalypse apostles, the main responsibility to assist the four apostles in managing the four core structures."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Randall Montgomery, Ai Delin Michel, who was put on the front."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, two people of similar shape, but different weapons, stepped forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Randall weapons are a pair of gloves, and Adeline takes a long scorpion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now appointed Randall, Adeline is the second of the Eight Great Storm Archbishops, Adeline is temporarily in charge of the Glendale, and Randall is in charge of the morning bell. Court.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chuck finished, Su Ge’s big hand waved, countless ghost flames fell, blended into the bodies of two people, forming a body on them The robes formed by the ghosts and ghosts are very handsome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you for the trust and gifts of my Lord! I will not let my Lord down!" the two men said in unison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Similar to the two apocalyptic apostles, the Archbishop of the Storm is now vacant six. My Lord is very generous, he likes good people, so everyone has a chance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Chuck simply induced and continued to introduce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Under the Eight Great Storm Archbishops are the twelve foggy bishops. The twelve foggy bishops are responsible for directly administering the region and the believers, monitoring the surrounding trends and dealing with the believers. The things that shelter the people of my Lord. Now that the bishop of the fog has seven, there are still five vacancies."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hills Barto Sis, Bernice Sagur, Carla, Alger, Nishizawa, Jean Guinness, Elena Sharin, was put on the front."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The next line of seven people came forward at the same time, and the heart was slamming down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chakram said: "Among the seven of you, Hills and Bernice have accepted the gift of my Lord. Now, five of you accept my Lord. The endless power!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sky, Su Ge waved, and the five valleys of fog and fog fell from the sky and merged into the bodies of these five people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, the five people’s bodies have undergone dramatic changes and have begun to be rapidly transformed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A moment, after several changes in human form and fog form, the look is shocked and grateful to return to normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My Lord is full of power and endless, I wish to give everything to my Lord!" Seven people sing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded slightly, and a mist of mist fell from the sky, shrouded in their bodies, making them look illusory and strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seven people retired, Chuck continued: "Under the fog bishop, a new mysterious career based on the four gods of my Lord, including The hoarfrost warrior, the foggy knight, the Guardian of the Hades, the Nightmare Warlock, who wants to get the new mysterious career in these four, needs to submit an application to the Pope through his own piety and merits."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pump! thump! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, everyone's heart began to accelerate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the weather apostle and the Archbishop of the Storm are too far away, then these four mysterious professions are not far away! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end, Chuck continued: "Finally, there is an appointment about the former Pope, Sogo Sotos."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sug Sotos is the first believer in this world and the only human who can bear the power of my Lord. If the Pope is the executor of my will. So Su Ge is the spokesperson of my will, and Su Ge has the most accurate understanding and execution of the will of my Lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For the church's development will not Deviation, contrary to the wishes of my lord, is hereby established to hold the position of Zhong Zhong, which means holding the alarm of warning, monitoring and controlling all the popes including the Pope, discovering our mistakes and correcting them in time." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, everyone has no meaning, bowing down and agreeing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, Chuck retired and Vanas, who benefited from Suge, stepped forward and turned around, putting his hands on his chest and making a clear, noble and arrogant the sound of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The people who stand here today will be the absolute core of the late bell church in the future! You are my people, the most precious asset of the church. The Lord is so generous, holding such a conference, and confessing to each other, let us witness the truth and embrace hope."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My Lord is glory and glory!" Daxie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice subsided, Vanas's tone gradually became cold, and loudly said: "My Lord always looks at each of us, I don't want anyone to reveal the church." Any secrets. Otherwise, even if the mercy of my Lord has spared you, I will chase you to the ends of the earth!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even if it is my parents! Even if It is my brother, my best friend, and I will never be soft-hearted!" The cold and majestic voice is full of decisiveness and coldness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One bell came out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bell seems to be in harmony with the voice of Vanas, and the bells of calmness are now with a kind of chill that can't be said, infiltrating the will and soul of everyone present. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with the spread of the bell, all the believers found themselves with an inexplicable sense of vagueness about the names of those who were just sealed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They know, but they are separated by a layer of fog, can’t say it, can’t remember. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas continues: "The formation of each church will be hostile. Today our church still does this, in order to prevent our believers from being certain People hypnotize and say some words that are contrary to their wishes. My Lord uses Shenwei to cover some important messages."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the kindness of my Lord. Asylum for the people! Because I will not let go of anyone who reveals important information about the church!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!" The powerful voice sounded neatly and in the tone. It is firm and decisive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire meeting arrived here and came to an end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge dispersed to the Ghost Throne and turned back to the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outside people are led by the Cavaliers and leave the Kingdom of God with hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The core staff of the church did not rush. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, the normal Suge walked out of the temple and asked Jeros: "What is the situation there?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just arrived in the Misty Mountains, the fog is more intense than before, and it seems to have mysterious fluctuations, I am not sure." Gerlos frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge stunned and turned to Randall and said, "You set off tonight, and helped in the past."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Randall nodded: "No problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adeline said: "My magic has been to Guinness to explain the situation. Pate will cooperate with you, her ability to sand is very effective for the fog, and there is a branch near the Misty Mountains."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
