			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two people coming, Laurie knows one of them, and the second one has seen it in the church about the heresy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lane, why are you coming here?" Laurie looked at the thin, triangular-eyed old man on the left of the two men, whispering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lyan, was the undead helper who was called in the morning of the ancient city of Ya, the godfather of the Holy Father. At first, he seemed to have at least the knowledge of the Lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the advent of the immortal dragon, his body was half-dead by the storm emperor Gewens, and then disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ryan sighed: "Nature is coming to redeem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While walking to the Soviet Union Beside the body, he said: "I have seen the clockman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled: "Gwens is good lately?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lyan respectfully nodded: "Drinking every day, sleeping, good, not good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "That's good, this trouble." Su Ge's tone is very polite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ryan pulled out the long sword at the waist and said to the other’s dominator: "You are polite. There is no chance to follow the emperor for more than a year, now At what point, I should also find someone to practice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be seen from the tone, he has studied in the hands of Gwens for more than a year. There are a lot of things, and the mysterious people at the dominator level are very confident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other undead person next to Ryan looked at Su Ge and smiled: "I haven’t seen you for more than two years, but your deeds have been widely circulated on the mainland. I heard that I am like a slap in the face."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The heresy of the cold-hearted church is also collusive with the church in the late bell!?" The bishop of the eye whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This second undead is the cook of the cold-hearted church in Bain City. When the dark child came, he and Luke touched the water. Fish's Clausen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the end of Bain City, he and Luke began to wander around the road, looking for Ada and some other traces of existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly and said, "I didn't expect you to find the North Wind continent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "This is naturally thanks to you, or I don't know that the Emperor's Majesty has already woken up." Clausen gratefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After more than a year ago, after hearing the news of the Emperor of the Storm, he separated directly from Luke, tracking the dragons left by the immortal dragons, and soon I found the storm emperor, Grace, who was scolding Ryan in the valley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the dead skin, it is also a classmate with Ryan, while serving Gwens. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the realm of these two people today, Su Ge is not clear, but he looks from the opposite of the two dominators, the two should be strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, Ge Wensi is a horrible existence that transcends immortality and contacts Shinto. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you just teach something in a year, you can make these two undead people endless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Suge’s chilling, Clausen turned to look at the Church of the Holy Blood: “I have nothing to do with the cold-blooded church, don’t take me and Those people are connected."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, take two daggers from your arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗖! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a stroke, the one-eyed archbishop did not respond, and a deep blood mark appeared on his cheek. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey! Don't be too much!" The airflow governor whispers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In general, they default to only the same level of people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clawson said casually: "Reassure, this is just a warning, not intended to kill him. Otherwise the wound will not cut on his face, and It is in his heart."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cyclops have touched the blood marks on their faces, and their faces are gloomy and look at the self-conscious Su Ge. The inner anger does not know. How to break out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is like playing a game, a dish is forced to stand there and ridiculously ridicule yourself, but you can’t hit this dish, and this dish doesn’t even use it. Shoot, you can call a bunch of top experts to hang yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This feeling of grievance is about to make the violent Cyclops autistic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sug Sotos!" The one-eyed archbishop gnawed his teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge spread his hand: "What does this have to do with me!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It looks like the most innocent in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame dominator in the sky is slowly falling, and everyone on both sides, the strongest force is already set. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, there is nothing left to look like on both sides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people in the pub saw this full-screen breathing, and the forehead slowly oozing sweat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The six dominators, the three lords, the dozens of masters! My God! I can't think of such a lineup." In the pub, the dragon flame believers The man muttered at this time, his face looked very funny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shock of others, there is no need for this one. At this time, these people seem to have forgotten to think, forgetting their own ridicule and disdain for the church in the late bell. , breathlessly watching this century war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have a win?" Serena whispered to Moore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moore whispered: "As far as the current situation is concerned, the church has a great win."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Lance followed with nod: "Really, now whether it is quality or quantity, the church in the late bells has a great advantage. If there is no accident, it should be no problem."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s not them who really decided to go." At this time, the petite woman who had never said anything suddenly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Learing her voice, Lance hurriedly said: "Please enlighten me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "This is..." Hills and Vigania were curious about this stern little girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moore looked at the petite woman with a squint and seemed to figure out some details and anomalies on her attire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, unfortunately, he couldn’t feel anything in this petite woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The petite woman took a sip of her hair, and her hair was paler and she showed more. "There is a higher level that really determines the outcome." Exist. Both sides are waiting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"More advanced existence?" Moore listened to his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lance tested: "Wait?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait for the first shot." The petite woman turned her head slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hills looked at it carefully: "This little girl is really good, and she looks very accurate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;噗! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Lance just squirted out of the drink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Little girl!?" Lance wandered his mouth and looked at Hills incredulously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The petite woman didn't seem to care. She turned her head and asked, and asked her voice in a lonely and cold voice. "I am a bit curious. How do your clock people deal with the church's backhand? I see that you have no other helpers. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hills did not speak, and did not seem to want to say more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vignia, who has been silent for a while, suddenly said: "I know who you are!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;A petite woman sighs, the voice asks with interest: "Talk about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You should be a pale ghost knight! Yes, it must be this name." Veginiya said in a soft tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pale Ghost Knight!?" Hearing this name, the people in the pub temporarily returned to God and instantly searched the brain for all the memories and found that It is a big person they don't know! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This idiot!!" Lance looked helplessly covering his face, his face faintly red, and he felt very embarrassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Pale ghost knight?" Petite woman savored, with a hint of joy and play in her tone: "This is a good name. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What I said! My vision is not wrong." Vegginia said with pleasure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Opening!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a person snorted and the entire pub fell into Dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle at this time has already had some appearances of war. The main battlefield is not the mysterious spell, but the most naked killing and hot weapon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All kinds of banned bombs, bullets, whistling past, all want to eliminate the mystery of the other side, melee solution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The six dominator-level amnesty did not take off, and the two sides lined up, facing each other while hoping for the largest range of asylum owners. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially the dominators of the Church of the Holy Blood, they know that one of Geros can swept their three archbishops, and this is even more precautionary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle between dominators is even more boring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The six people are motionless, even what they do, others don’t feel it, they are like six wood people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the discerning people know that they are carrying out the most horrific, most dangerous battles, the struggle and erosion of rules. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The losing party is hard to survive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Church of the Holy Blood is not afraid because they have sky marks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evening church is not afraid, because two of them are undead, and one is the ambassador sent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the six people are now fighting together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of several clerics who were half-dead was thrown into the middle of six people by the crazy werewolf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a scream, these clergymen disappeared directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It disappeared, and almost a moment he was completely disintegrated, turning into the naked eye and not seeing the dust, dissipating in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, the space between the six people is a turbulent flow of knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And here, Gerlos and Mill have started their killing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood splatters, the internal organs, the bloodiest and primitive battles begin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, no one can be spared in the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug stood on the battlefield of Hell, calmly watching the death of the enemy and the death of his compatriots. There is nothing in the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is just an ordinary person. He is very powerless at this time. He is far from mysterious. He has no fighting power. He can't hurt anyone and can't help anyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, he is an outsider, a spectator. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After everything is returned, one is everything..." Watching the soldiers who are fighting, watching the different blood blending together on the ground The bodies that looked at each other's rivals were only stuck together because of death, and even the messy internal organs had piled up together without each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now, who are you? Who is you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, Su Ge The eyes flashed through an indescribable light, and he suddenly looked up at the sky: "Who am I!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, I am Su Ge, I am Su Ge Sotos." Su Ge whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He squinted and found that the dark clouds were dissipating, and three huge moons appeared again in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the light that had just flashed in his eyes flashed again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I...when I saw the starry sky, I saw everything there." No one knew what Sug had seen, nor did he know that he had figured it out at this time. what. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Somewhere in the distance, Pharaoh sat on the roof of the church, next to him was a white body, like a baby, a monster with a strange pattern . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It floats in midair at this time, and countless black breaths emerge from the battlefield, and as the night wind comes here, it is fully absorbed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the absorption of these black gas, its pale eyes continue to squirm, seemingly to open the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Pharaoh’s sight is not here, at this time he is looking up at the dark night sky, not knowing what he saw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It turns out that this is the case, is this your plan? The little monster hiding behind the door? Are you eager to avoid the father's wake in this way?" It is a pity that this kind of reincarnation has been going on for countless years. You can't hide it before, but you still can't hide it this time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Pharaoh said, bowed his head, Just saw Su Ge also regained his gaze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, the eyes of two people crossed the distance and did not know how far the distance was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The viewer lasted for three seconds and the two laughed at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled very happy and seemed to see old friends who had not seen them for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Pharaoh laughed very refreshedly and seemed to see a playmate who grew up together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know that you are a conspiracy, but you succeeded in attracting my attention to you, Sotos. I want to see what you have. The two generations of the king of the gods have led countless gods have fallen, what kind of waves can you be an ordinary mortal in this innocent universe?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Speaking, he looked up again and looked at the south. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a relatively bright star visible at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is incredible in this world, but it does exist at this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Pioneer of Destruction, Judging the World, Come on."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge Recovered In sight, he touched it and took out the book he had seen from Myra. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
