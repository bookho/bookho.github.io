			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people stand in front of the pyramid and take a closer look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This pyramid is about twenty meters high, and the bottom is thirty meters square, which belongs to that kind of small pyramid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a lot of sands around the pyramid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but these sands are not gold, but ordinary metals processed by alchemists, with the color of gold, but in essence iron sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pyramid is made of ochre stone and looks like a whole, without any gaps and passages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Running again." Shirley is very calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year and a half, they have run a lot of white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go, what are you waiting for?" Xue Lier looked at Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge returned to God and said, "Since you have come, you can't go so naturally."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "I still want to go to the graveyard!?" Shelly eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled: "This is not a cemetery, it is a big house, it is very spacious inside."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley turned to look at the pyramid and sighed: "Give you an hour!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then two people went to the pyramid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Be careful, there are a lot of sand bugs in the sand around you," said Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The worm is a unique worm in the desert. It looks like a cockroach. The color is earthy yellow. Each one is large and one foot long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not only are they highly toxic, they are extremely aggressive, and they are all carnivorous insects. People and animals are not spared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It takes ten minutes for a group of sand worms to eat one person. In the end, only the hair is left, and the bones are even completely smashed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley's brows are slightly wrinkled, and she is very disgusted with the arthropods with many legs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not afraid, just seeing that there is a crushing impulse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hands on the wall of the pyramid, and the subtle vibrations are transmitted through the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!" A few seconds later, Su Ge looked surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's wrong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that the legend is true." Su Ge said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The spirit of the emperor is still there?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded: "This is a big one." The pyramid is a prison. I just felt that there are at least 100 souls inside. The spiritual energy of these souls is very fluctuating, and I guess all have evolved into giant demon spirits."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you going to do?" Xuelier asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge touched his chin and said: "There are seven rooms in the entire pyramid, corresponding to the so-called six pillars of the third dynasty. There is a god in the middle. It is the god of the third dynasty worship, the god of the wind and sand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shirley looked like a lack of interest: "I have any plans, say it directly. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Still forget." Su Ge thought about shaking his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Afraid?" Xue Lier's eyebrows picked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded: "A hundred giant demon spirits, the risk is still too great, and the soul of the emperor in the middle seems to have undergone a horrible variation. I am not sure now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Su Ge first took the potion, he encountered a giant demon spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I didn't see it, I could see it. Gerlos was still relatively cautious at the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is indeed much stronger than Jelos at that time, but he is not sure he will face more than a hundred of the great demon spirits at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go!" said Su Ge, turned and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley did not want to stay here for a long time, and the two left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wall on the other side of the entire tomb gradually loosened as soon as the two left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a row of about a dozen excited face tomb thieves came in from the hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's right! That's right! This is where the great incarnation of the Lord of the Sands is suppressed!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Get rich! Make a fortune! The great sandstorm master can not only give us endless wealth and virginity, but also let us gain tremendous strength and eternal life!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Fellows, for our tomorrow, save the Lord of the Yellow Sand!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lion Empire, Ocean City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ocean City is a port city in the northwest of the Lion Empire and one of the jewels of the entire empire. It has been the largest empire for centuries. port. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wingfeng Chain Hotel is one of the top ten famous chain hotels in the world. Behind it is the mysterious organization: the home of the Master of Travel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the universality of the House of Travelers in the whole world, the people who live in the Windward Hotel are generally mysterious, or do work related to mystery. Upper class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are seven floors and five prismatic hotels on the fifth floor. Just after enjoying the bath, Su Ge and Sherry are comfortable lying on the bed. Relax your body and spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is already seven o'clock at night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people walked out of the ancient deep forest at eleven o'clock, took a train from a small town, and arrived at Ocean City not far from 3 o'clock in the afternoon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where are you going?" asked Shirley's body wrapped around Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looked at the ceiling and said: "I haven’t thought about it yet, we can play here for a few days. I heard that the broccoli is very famous and can go. Just like the famous dance star, the angel's Elisa is touring here in the past few days. Don't you want to listen to music? Let's listen, her band is famous in the world."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley nodded and said that he was very satisfied with the arrangement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is your church, how is it going?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not bad, one In the past year and a half, there has been no large-scale expansion, and the foundation has been steadily stabilized. The entire church-related processes and rules and regulations have been completed, and finally a little out of the church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, Su Ge’s face is full of happiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas’s means of operation far exceeded his imagination. In the past year and a half, the whole church was clearly arranged by her, without any traces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Shirley turned and muttered: "Since it is so simple, I will also go to a church."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug did not care, knowing that she just said it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She does not have this kind of patience and leisure to engage in such things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hungry, let's go eat." Shelly said, turning over and getting out of bed, picking up the underwear on the floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge licked his stomach and felt very hungry. After all, they had not had serious eating for several days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Press a casual dress and two people walked out of the room to the restaurant on the third floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
