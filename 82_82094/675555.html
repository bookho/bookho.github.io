			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadows that Marlene radiated directly hugged the three cultists who rushed over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the moment of being embraced by the shadow, the three people suddenly became stiff, and then fell to the ground with softness, not knowing that life is death. At the same time, Father Anthony brought a pair of special gloves, and there was a strong current in his hands. The body rushed to another one at a very fast speed. In front of the ghoul, a fist with a fist of iron fists in the night sky with a phantom, a few breaths between the ghouls that have not yet reacted directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghoul that has a big bleeding here stops the blood in some way, and the two arms are squatting, like a rubber extension, with its sharp claws. It is like two big sickles that are picked up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marlene first held Roland back, and Anthony came to the front of the ghoul in two steps after he was able to do so, and then he opened the bow around his fist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰砰砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few breaths were played in a few dozens of fists. The ghoul was smashing and squatting, and finally he was unable to stand on the ground and could not stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Quick!" After finishing the cultists, Anthony quickly turned and picked Roland and turned and ran. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I still want to run!?" Suddenly, full of cold and irritating sounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three people suddenly felt stiff after listening to the body, but when they were ready to escape, they found that they lost control of the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that your brain is caught by something and cannot make any orders to the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Master ghoul wearing a white dress, Gly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, half of Gly's head is a ghoul form, half is a human form, and the size is different, and it looks very distorted and awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After controlling Roland's three people, he first looked down at the fallen men on the ground, and then said indifferently: "There are so many talents in the church, and several clerics sent by them have such combat power." /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland paled and asked: "What do you want to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She would not say It’s a stupid thing to kill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deeply taught by the teachings of the late hour, she deeply knows the preciousness of her life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gray sneered: "I don't want to do anything, I just want to kill you in this group of priests."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this unreasonable reason, Roland suddenly looked pale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gray slowly raised his hand, the ordinary man's nails extended instantly, and finally turned into a sharp spur that was one meter long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After piercing your eye with this spur, it will draw enough blood to grow the barb. When I slowly pull it out, it will Bring your eyes together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that he opened his mouth and went to Roland: "It’s beautiful eyes, it will be very delicious!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the sharp spur that gradually approached his eyes, Roland struggled desperately but to no avail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this critical moment, suddenly a bang, a burst of smoke will cover everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who!?" was blocked by smoke, and Gladton was violent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, no one responded to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was only a violent rubbing sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a moment, Gran’s hands suddenly became bigger, and each hand was two meters long. Then suddenly it was a fan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a strong wind, the smoke quickly dissipated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not far from him, a young man in black clothes tied the three men together with a rope and dragged them away quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Looking for death!" Gloria looked up and his body instantly skyrocketed and turned into a monster with a height of two meters and covered with blood red muscles and pale bones. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this form, he has a body comparable to a giant ghoul, and his body rushes out like a cheetah, catching up with a breath. Connor outside the rice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hurry!" Connor saw this eye suddenly tightening, and then suddenly launched his defensive mystery costume. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the sound was heard, the piece of the shield seemed to be broken instantly, and Connor’s body stepped back three steps, sitting on the ground and sullen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gap between experts and masters is huge, not to mention that this is a born Yi who has far more talent than ordinary people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a black bear falling from the sky here, and the violent look seems to shred all four people in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the moment when Gry immediately succeeded, a sudden appearance of the air cannon hit the body of Gry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge impact forceed its large body to fly directly four or five meters away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory’s face is very dignified. From the moment he just felt that he was able to release the power of this attacking person, whether it is psionic or knowledgeable. Mastery is above yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s finally catching up." There was a slightly relaxed voice in the darkness, and it was obvious that the sound was relaxed and relaxed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four people on the ground were shocked when they heard the sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because they are too familiar with this voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the shock, nature is overjoyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge came out of the darkness and looked at the invisible Grae. The tone said coldly: "I finally found you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know Me?" Greg was cautious in his heart and his body was getting stronger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you remember the few night patrols who were killed by you in the graveyard a few days ago?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gray listened and grinned: "Of course, I remembered that they were desperate and frightened. I still remember very clearly now."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, Gry looked at Su Gedao: "How? And the church of the late bells with the Church of the Holy Blood, do you still have to avenge the clergy of the Church of the Holy Blood?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge stepped forward, icy: "You can understand this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"嘎嘎嘎That's really ironic." Gloria made a ridiculous laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice did not fall, his big head suddenly squirmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This moment, Su Ge felt the invisible power on his head, then he felt his consciousness was imprisoned in the brain, lost the right The control of the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Death!" Graham's low voice, the body came to Su Ge in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be careful!" Anthony and Marlene yelled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland is calm and calm: "It's okay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the moment when Gry was close to Su Ge, accompanied by a thick late bell, Gry felt his body hit a very strong On the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The invisible force then grabbed his body and bounced himself back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this? Psionic shield!?" Feeling this move, Gry feels incredible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
