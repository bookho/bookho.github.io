			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to Bernice’s explanation, the three sisters suddenly found that the real female warlock sisters were completely different from their own understanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benedict turned to look out of the window and said calmly: "Look out, your teacher completely distrusts you."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big sister hesitated to ask: "How did you see it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You didn't find it, when you entered the door One made the demon leave from the streetlight.” Bernice pointed to the streetlight on the left side of the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, the three people suddenly paled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most fearful two sisters suddenly panic, and the whole body could not help but tremble and asked: "This... what can I do?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past few years, they have seen their teachers' methods of dealing with traitors many times. The cruel means that they have to do long and long nightmare after each reading. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The younger sister was also panicked, holding her second hand in her hands and looking pale, and could not speak for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the big sister has to mature a lot, she looks relatively calm, and seriously looks at Bernice and asks: "Premier Miss Bernice, you can Are you sheltering us? We are willing to offer all the faith, respect, and wealth to the great misty god."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bennis did not immediately agree, faint Say: "My Lord is not interested in your wealth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But we have faith! We have been unbelievers for many years, and our faith is very Purity and piety. We are willing to give our Lord an absolutely loyal faith." Big sister is not stupid, I heard the meaning of this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benedict still did not agree, turned to look at the two sisters and the younger sister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are too!" Two girls who were frightened and daring suddenly nodded like a chicken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bernice said calmly: "Your faith is loyal, it is not me to decide, nor is it your own decision."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear this, three people I blinked and didn't know what it meant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benedict continues: "You live here tonight, I promise you absolute safety. And whether your faith is pious, your will is loyal, etc. After you enter the Kingdom of God, you have your own results."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shen Country!!!!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, the three people suddenly opened their eyes, the look of horror and incredible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although they are unbelievers, the two words of the Kingdom of God represent what they mean very clearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How? Don't you dare?" Bernice asked coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three sisters hurriedly shook their heads, and the older sister said with a shocked face: "It just feels incredible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "There are a lot of incredible things in the world, but you haven't seen them." Bernice finished and clap his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maid waiting outside the door came over: "Miss."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To three guests Arrange temporary accommodation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three sisters looked at each other and then looked firm Nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are now eligible for regret and retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss Bernice, if our faith is enough devout, can we get rid of the devil's mastery?" asked the second sister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;British calmly replied: "This is a very disrespectful idea."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second sister Looking at the deep and cold eyes of Bernice, she narrowed her neck and hurriedly apologized: "Sorry! Miss Bernice, please forgive me for my ignorance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Bernice turned to look out the window: "If you still have this kind of ignorance and disrespect, then please leave here immediately."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry! Sorry! The three sisters hurriedly bowed and bowed their faces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benedict did not continue to speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three, please." said the maid on the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three sisters looked at the back of Bernice with uneasiness and followed the maid upstairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Bernice looking out the window is thinking about the next plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "With the old lady's habits, she will never give up, although she will not report my private female warlock without brain, but at night it is very good. It is possible to attack. Her attribute is ice, which is similar to the teacher's attributes. But after all, it is a master, not the first time, it is estimated that this evening is a test."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Think of this, Bernice closed his eyes and passed the information to Adeline through the storm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A moment, Adeline’s message responded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will look in the dark, you can follow your plan."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen At this point, Bernice let go of her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stretching the body, Bernice’s eyes eagerly said: "After staying for so long, there is finally a chance to be active."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has been in the Imperial City for two years, only to save the Cuixi when the shot, the other time is an elegant and beautiful, dignified and restrained aristocratic lady. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire emperor, knowing that she is a mysterious person, but a palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Bernice calculated his plan, Su Ge was blowing the sea breeze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point the cruise has been completely away from the mainland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking around, there is no sky or sky around, no other scenery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weather is still very good today, the sea breeze is blowing, very comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge and Sherry sit on the bow and look at the sea breeze and watch the dolphins around the cruise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of leisurely and comfortable day, even in this year and a half is very rare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you know how many eyes are staring at you now?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl said casually on the fence: "I don't know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Think Do you know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Don't want to."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...you can't follow me Speaking down?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl said with a look of contempt: "I really don't understand why you care about the worm's gaze."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because we are bugs now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are, I am not."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looked at her seriously, too lazy to continue to talk, continue to close eyes and enjoy a rare good day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After lunch, two people left the restaurant and were stopped by a middle-aged man in a blue suit while passing through a cabin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Beautiful and distinguished Miss Newton, my family hopes to spend a beautiful afternoon with you." The middle-aged completely ignored Su Ge, facing Sherry Demeanor said respectfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl did not speak, slowly raised his hand, but Suge grabbed it and pressed it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug is very aware of the consequences of this hand, elegant smile, casually said: "Miss Newton has a male partner, no interest in your family." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, the middle-aged face immediately gloomy, whispering: "I am talking to Miss Newton, where are you qualified to speak?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They A thorough investigation of the bottom line of this pair of men and women has been made clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This beautiful and fascinating Miss Newton is a lonely aristocrat, her ancestors seem to have a great glory, but because the times are too long Can not be studied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Miss Newton is now an adventurer and historian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this identity, everyone is convinced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the perfect body in the black dress is so soft and fit, charming and elegant, it has the vitality of a young girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially the thighs and the flexible waist that are just right for exercise, so many men are fascinated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the best proof of years of exercise and running back and forth in various dangers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the beautiful little white-faced male partner of Miss Newton is also a lonely nobleman. He is a historian and psychologist. The intersection of two people is from the university. Start. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a year and a half, two people have been running around the world after graduating from college. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the two people have similar family backgrounds and the same academic qualifications, they should look like ordinary people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, in the eyes of some big men, this kid is far from qualified to accompany this beautiful and charming lady. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She should be with her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the attitude of the middle-aged, Su Ge is not angry, looked at Shirley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley had to raise his hand again and was pressed down by Su Ge again. Then he calmly said to the middle-aged man: "I am Ms. Newton. My fiancé, your husband wants to invite my fiancée, is it too overbearing without my consent?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man was a little impatient at this time and used a look at the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, several crew members of the hustle and bustle walked out of the cabin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge's mouth tilted slightly: "It's finally coming."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing here When I lived, a young man was drunk in the distance, and his eyebrows were full of frustration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man is Drake North. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He got all the family members to buy a ticket of the lowest level, just to let these rich people see their legendary experience, then Perhaps a woman who loves to listen to a story as a male pet, or can find a gentleman who loves to invest, can let himself publish his own legendary autobiography. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also hopes to meet the legendary mystery, to let himself enter a new world, to get rid of the current predicament. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the results are very realistic, those fish people, those monsters he clearly saw, but no one is willing to believe him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t sleep well last night because of his inner feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, on the one hand, it is depressed, on the other hand, the lowest soundproofing of the cabin is very bad, and the voice of a lady next door makes him more upset. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why are those ladies unable to see my talents!" Thinking, he was even more depressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now his state is a bit bad, maybe because he didn’t sleep well, his ears have some auditory hallucinations, he heard some weird whispers, and some weird The sound of the fish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well!?" At this moment, he blinked and suddenly saw a big news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dreek knows who the middle-aged is, that is the chief of the ship, but the real big man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Which ignorant poor worm has provoked these big men?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
