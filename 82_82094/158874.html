			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the interior of the Church of the Holy Blood, Father Sug and Anthony walked in the quaint long corridor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the baptism was completed, Father Anthony took Suge to familiarize himself with the complexity of the church and finally led him to his future studio. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The department of the Holy See is more complicated, and I will mainly talk to you about the mysterious department."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "First of all, the church's top and most elite departments: the Holy Swords and the Hymns. The Holy Swords are mainly responsible for the expedition to attack cults, heretics and monsters and other large-scale combat elite forces, large numbers, well-equipped ""The choir is at the heart of the spirit of the whole church. They are the closest to the goddess, and their devout spirits lead the church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the Shuangsheng Department only exists in the church institutions of the headquarters city and the first-tier cities, and other branch churches do not."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these two departments, Father Anthony does not seem to know much, and continues to say: "Next, let's talk about the general configuration of our city church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Hunter, Defender, Exorcist, Nightwatcher, you know, I will not say more. I mainly said There is a close relationship with your function."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your department is called the March Apostle. It is divided into a cure for the moon, a bloody executioner, and a purple moon. The number of them is relatively small, but it can be said that each is an elite."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Moon Healer is a back office worker who is responsible for the medical facilities and blood of the entire church. The Church of the Moon is the healer of Hank."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The bloody month performer is a field worker, the main loser is the direct execution of some prisoners and Cults."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Which is the bloody executioner of our church?" Su Ge asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Anthony flashed a hint of hesitation, and then smiled: "This has little to do with you, I continue to say it."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge’s eyes flashed through a faint light, listening quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As for your current Ziyue traveler, it is special. The position of the purple moon traveler is the development and guidance of technology and mystery, and later due to decentralized research and development. The cost is too high, and they are concentrated and form the independent department of today: the Holy Blood Institute. Later, the purple moon substitutes were compiled into a semi-combat sequence, which is responsible for the investigation and resolution of mysterious events in the city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because of being a researcher, the tradition of the Purple Moon traveller is learned and extensive. Each of them is proficient in technology or mystery, which is in their own There is a very important help in the investigation process."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is the difference between this function and the demon hunter and the punisher?" Asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Anthony explained: "Of course, the main function of the demon hunter is to hunt heresy, rarely the ordinary mysterious events. The scepter and the exorcism Most of the nuns are responsible for the expulsion and destruction, and they are all collective actions, which is not convenient for investigation. The night watchman is responsible for inspections and early warnings, and has little effect during the day.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Su Ge heard this question: "That is to say, today's Ziyue traveler is relying on his own knowledge, responsible for the investigation of mysterious events, small things to solve their own problems, big things to find helpers to solve?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Day, do you go back to the identity of the investigator?" I feel very uncomfortable in my heart. Father Anthony continued: "It is not easy to train a good purple moonwalker. They need to have a wide range of knowledge and means to deal with various investigations in their own investigations." Events. You also need to have enough mental qualities and combat ability to protect yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Father Anthony looks at Su Ge: "You are one The gods also have the talent to communicate with the soul to make it easier for you to get extra information. Master Geros says that you have a strong psychological quality, behave with enough care, and have a high desire for knowledge. These conditions and The Ziyue traveller who often acts alone is completely fit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Single action!?" Su Ge heard four words in his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This position doesn't seem so bad as I thought it!" Su Ge was in a good mood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony continues to talk about the helplessness of today's situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The recent series of incidents have been very irritating to Bishop Rogan, and we clearly feel the insufficiency and lack of mystery. Since the last sacrifice of the Purple Moon His duties have been shared with several departments, and it is usually okay, but once there is a big problem, the problem is exposed. You have actually acted as a substitute for the purple moon this time."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It was two years ago!" Su Ge thought of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart and he said that the mysterious system here was hit hard for some things two years ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the previous generation of Ziyue travellers was sacrificed at that time, not by chance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French Anthony continued: "After this time, your talent and tenacity have been affirmed by both the bishop and the master of Gerlos. They think that you are becoming purple. The best candidate for the moonwalker is ready to focus on cultivating you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded and said: "Thanks to the expectations of the bishop and master Gerlos, I will try to be An excellent purple moon traveler, but I may need some time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassure, each clergy has a one-month acclimation period and study period Father Anthony patted Suger's shoulder and comforted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded and smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very satisfied with this position. As a formal cleric, Su Ge also runs his own church. He needs a relatively quiet environment and a sufficiently free operational function. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This position can be said to fully meet all the requirements of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has access to a lot of knowledge, which is the most suitable for him with a god cpu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important thing is that the whole department is now alone, and he is free and independent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
