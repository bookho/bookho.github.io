			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the ant tavern, Sug sat in the corner, watching a young man with a purple hair, purple eyes, and white cloth armor being preached. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No one can escape the catastrophe of civilization, the world has been shattered 20,000 years ago, when the entire human being was controlled by the horrible evil spirits, falling into a dream It became a slave to the ancient evil spirits. Now the evil spirits are about to wake up again. If we want to survive in this desperate world, we can only enter the ideal township far from the world."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the ideal township, all people will be good in heart, all people will stop the dispute, all people can be peaceful and redeemed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where is the ideal township you said!?" A drunken mercenary asked casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Youth True Color explains: "The ideal hometown away from the world is outside the end of the world. It is the hometown of fairies and elves, and can also be called the other side of the world. Want to get there, we have to pass the test of the lake elves, embark on the road of no regrets in the lake, after being baptized and purified in the lake, we can pass through the stars desert to come to the great holy city of our elf church: A pure barrier without hurts - Safiro. After entering the Holy City, we can see the great Lord. His light can make us forget the disputes and hatred, and finally pass through the towers at the end of the world into the world. The ideal hometown enjoys the peace and tranquility of eternal life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It sounds like trouble, I still drink my bar!" The young man said confusedly. , start the wine glass and continue to drink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man said loudly: "This process is a baptism, an evolution, the lake of no regrets can strengthen our will, the stars desert can absorb our impurities , we..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, it’s time!" The bartender on the side patted his shoulder and interrupted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young people sighed a bit unwillingly, touched the pocket for a long time, took out 60 cents, and took 50 cents from it to the bartender. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking out, the price of this mission is not cheap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After paying the money, the young man sat down in a corner and sat right next to Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge slightly asked sideways: "You just said that the world has been shattered 20,000 years ago, is this true and false?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The youth listened to the turn, looked at Su Ge’s look and the line and said, “Of course it’s true. The people of our Elf Church entered the ideal at that time. The township was able to survive our sects."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there any evidence?" Su Ge asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The history of the entire human race has a well-documented time of about seven or eight thousand years. Most of the records in the past are very vague, fragmented, and even many things change. Become a legend, wild history, strange talk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the first and second dynasties known now are the ancient dynasties dating back 20,000 years ago, 15,000 years ago, but among them Most of the history is an officially recorded history book. Although it is possible to roughly know some of the current situation, most of the cases are ambiguous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, the official history book, just look at it, don't take it too seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man proudly replied: "There are a lot of books in our elf sect that record the secrets. What you are eager to know is in the big library in our holy city." ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, the young tempted said: "If you want to know, you can join our Elf Order, so you have the opportunity to know which ones were buried by time. History."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hahaha, although I am very curious, but my reason tells me that the holy city you said can not enter Su Ge smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, after all, that is the sacred field that true pure people can enter." The youthful purple eyes are solemn and sacred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know your name yet," Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young and generous answer: "My name is Lance Cerro, a missionary of the Elf Order."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge did not say the real name, whispered: "I said that I am Connor William. Leading the oak axe, do you believe it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen At this point, Lance purple's pupil flashed a glimmer of light, his hand slowly extended to the waist, with a dignified question on his face: "Who are you!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "You can call me a clockman, now a queen's entourage. Connor was seriously injured a few days ago and was rescued by my entourage. The day before yesterday, he just woke up this morning." Su Ge briefly Said the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Learning this, Lance sighed a little and heard that it should not be an enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looked at his expression and continued: "I saw a melee on the street yesterday. It seems that I was robbing something. The Assassin League was attacked. The siege, the situation is very pessimistic. Connor asked me to come over to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Would you like to help them?" asked Lance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge smiled a little: "Do I want you to believe?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not believe." Lance generously shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I care more about what they are fighting for." Su Ge said straightforwardly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no free lunch in the world, I want to help them, at least give some rewards, isn't it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lance nodded slightly: "Yes, what do you want?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are they robbing? What is it?" Asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lance looked around and looked around and said to Su Ge: "The Holy Grail document."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;! ! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this Suge pupil zoom in slightly, this is not the first time he heard the name. He listened to Bart when he told the Green Flame Brotherhood. It is said that there is a holy grail document in Bain City, but then he forgets with a series of things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
