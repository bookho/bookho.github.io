			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two people on the bed opened their eyes calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley lay comfortably on Su Ge’s chest: "Why, the purpose of bringing me is to show me your ugliness?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge screamed: "False, miscalculated."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is that squid?" Dream is not her home Although she felt that the thing was not a good thing, she could not see what it was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge swayed Shirley’s smooth, flat belly and thought, “It’s a child of God.”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The octopus?" Shirley browed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded: "I have seen this technique. There should be a Polar Institute, or a Cthulhu church. They want to pass. The body of the little mouse is born."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where is the son of the octopus so easy to be born? Don't forget the calling ceremony of Bain City." Shirley said . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge laughed: "He and you are definitely not comparable. Of course, this does not mean that it is so easy to give birth. The little mouse is just a container, dream The one in the mere fictional shadow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Su Ge picked up the log from the bow and looked at the middle route. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire route presents an s-type with no stops in the middle and direct access to the Port of Tedu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looked at the dense coordinates above, then pointed to the entire s-type in the middle of a point saying: "Purple monthly 47.9, blood monthly 126.43, this The location is very close to Laleille, and the ship happens to pass."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole world is not a planet, as the whole world looks like, people are still Did not understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The annotation of the world position is specified by the flight path of the three moons in the sky and the relevant underground angle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;East, West, and North are divided into Cang Yuedu, Ziyue, Blood Moon and Moonless, which symbolize the coordinates of the four directions of East, North, West and South. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The upper limit of the coordinate degree for each direction is 333. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley looked up lazily and asked casually: "Will there be a ceremony there?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded: "Yes, there are still two days away from here. I guess at that time the whole ship will definitely go wrong and stop the repair, and a certain son will come from the sea." The body of the small mouse is bred."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are your plans?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am sure Can't let them be happy, if the ghost thing is really out, the whole boat will die," Sukri said of course. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you care about human life and death?" Xue Lier brows slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge silenced for a second and answered seriously: "I don't care, just ask for a peace of mind. People are social animals with feelings, we just need to be in the crowd." There will be feelings in it. I don't want people I like and care to die in front of me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl thought of Su Ge in Ocean City and himself Those words that are said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, sleep."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, the body arched and was attached to Su Ge Body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corner of Su Ge’s mouth showed a soft smile, and he said with a sigh: "Even if I have a piece of cold iron, I have been stunned for more than a year, and it should be hot." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, the arm squatted on the strong double peaks to sleep beautifully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, the two men finished washing and replaced them Relatively loose clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger is wearing a light blue shirt, no tie, double sleeves, and a light beige casual pants, which looks very laid-back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley put on a black silk silk dress, white stockings on both legs, and her flat-legged women's shoes on her feet, keeping her favorite clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although she was so bold and unrestrained in front of Su Ge, she seemed to be very disgusted with seeing her body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In her previous words to the Holy Father and others: "They don't deserve!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Early! Mr. Assin, Ms. Newton, is it still the same?" The two men just sat down at the restaurant on the third floor, and the waiter came over enthusiastically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two had only had a breakfast here, and the waiter remembered the breakfast for two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge nodded with satisfaction and gave him a one-centle tip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waiter suddenly smiled as if he had eaten candy, and said with a smile: "Please wait a moment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley took the chin with his hand in the black gauze glove and looked at the outer deck along the window next to him and said, "The little mouse seems to be waiting very anxious."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When she spoke, she had a hint of drama and interest in her expression, like a researcher who observed experimental mice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looked down at her sight, just to see Drake’s anxious and restless standing at this moment, at this time, dissatisfied, it seems Waiting for someone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Drake state that can be seen is even worse than yesterday. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if his neck and hands appeared something was not very noticeable fine lines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The subtle shape is like a gap in a layer of scales. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The form has gradually separated from humans." Shirley likes to see examples of people's failures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge casually said: "Someone should approach him soon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, the two look very common, the well-dressed man approached Drake, and after two sentences, Drake was followed by the savior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "These two are not mysterious, and they are very cautious," said Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two, please use!" At this time, the waiter pushing the dining car has come over with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg said to pick up the knife and fork. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley took a bite of soy milk and asked, "Are you sure he will come to you? But go directly to those people?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s attitude is very confident: “Of course, it’s not just a family to go to a doctor’s office. Even if he first contacts the Cthulhu church, he will come later. Find me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why can you see?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Compared to a very deliberate meeting, Instinctively, he would be more convinced of the passers-by who inadvertently saw."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After breakfast, two people just came to the deck from the restaurant on the third floor, Drey Gram carefully followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You...Hello." Drake was full of turbid eyes at this moment, like the eyes of a pair of dead fish, and his voice became a little hoarse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl turned his head and looked at him and turned to look outboard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the eyes of Shirley, Drake’s heart suddenly jumped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At that moment, he seemed to have forgotten all the pain and was completely immersed in the seductive face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello, is there anything?" Su Ge responded politely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drake licked his hand and said with a hoarse voice: "Hello, sir, I don't feel very good now, I listen to other passengers, you are one Psychiatrist, I think you can help me see if something is wrong with my heart?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge’s expression was a slap in the face, and then carefully looked at Drake. “Your state is really bad, but you better go see a doctor, not a psychiatrist.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No!" Drake hurriedly interrupted: "My body is not sick, I am sure, I just heard some weird things, it seems to be whispering, it seems to be a sound of running water." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug did not speak, looked at him with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dreek saw that Su Ge did not agree, and hurriedly whispered: "I... I am a little presumptuous. But I dreamed of something weird." I feel that I seem to be possessed by something. I know that you are a mystery. If you can help me, I am willing to be your servant and apprentice and offer my remaining life."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s smile at the corner of his mouth is louder and more calm, saying: “If this is the case, then we can find a relatively quiet place to talk.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Drake suddenly breathed a deep breath and said with great respect: "Thank you, thank you. May the goddess of fortune always bless you." ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come with me!" Su Ge said, taking Shirley into the cabin on the second floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second floor has all the entertainment measures of the entire cruise ship. Su Ge took Drake to the bar and opened a private room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three people sat down and Su Ge calmly asked: "Do you know what you just said?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know! I know! As long as you can heal me, free me from this strange state, I am willing to offer you everything, I can be your mysterious servant, apprentice Drake said very seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not lose his mind. He is now more eager to get into the door of Su Ge and become a true mystery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s mouth tilted slightly and said: “I feel your sincerity, Mr. Drake.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Dreek immediately became happy after listening and said: "That..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
