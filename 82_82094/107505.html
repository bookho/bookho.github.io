			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The original fire..." After hearing these four words, Su Ge fell into deep meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The word, he has not heard of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart does not intend to let Su Ge think too much and continue to release heavyweight news: "The group of people have sneaked into the city and secretly began to prepare for the squad. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait! Dive into the city? Can you say..." Su Ge suddenly thought of something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bar features nodded: "You are not slow to react. The ghost ship itself has nothing special, that boat is just to attract your attention. Force, so that their people can quietly sneak into the city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that, Bart laughed and said: "Your archbishop is really stupid. In order to deal with this, Actually, all the mysterious teams in the whole city were transferred, which led to the emptiness of other places. The effect of this ghost ship was very successful, not only the vision of the scepter, the fighting nun, and even the demon hunter. They even cleverly put their attention on the Twin League. And you have no doubts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge heard this and suddenly felt a little face There is no light, sophistry said: "You are too embarrassed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a mutter, Su Ge immediately shifted the topic, said with an angry face: "Just because of this Kill a person on board!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;& Nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this not enough? In the eyes of those who are mad, there is no difference between human life and animal life." Bart sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge pinched his fist and asked: "I don’t want to understand, since they want to summon things, why not go to the wilderness to summon, but instead After a setback, risking such a huge risk to run into a second-tier city to summon?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart pondering, seems to be organizing language. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After ten seconds, Bart evaded the weight and said: "The summoning of the original fire must require huge popularity. The more people there, the higher the success rate of summoning. The defense of the first-tier cities is too strong, so they will choose second-tier cities. It is just that the current mysterious defenses in Bain City are very scarce, and they have become their primary goal."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Now the city of Bain? Is the mysterious aspect of Bain’s predecessor very strong?” Su Ge caught a glimpse of his words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart’s smile with a thumbs up on his face said: “I can see that you are very sensitive to the language. The city of Bain was very much in mysterious defense. Known as the second-tier city of the empire that has developed for hundreds of years, the pearl of the northwest has been very reliable, but because of one thing, the mysterious defense system of the entire city of Bain has been hit hard."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Su Ge asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart smiled and said: "Intelligence is free."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Beating!" Su Ge Grit your teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bad’s smile said: “If you help me solve this problem, we can become a truly intimate partner. At that time, I can Give you a lot of important information, believe me, this information will be very effective for your promotion in the Church of the Holy Blood."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly some heartbeat, but the face did not show up, calmly said: "First talk about what I am paying now!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I got it here Intelligence, there are about 12 people in the Green Flame Brotherhood in the city, two of whom are expert-level sorcerers, and the rest are professional-level combatants, including swordsmen, killers, hypnotists, and magic. Teacher, adviser, and ecstasy. The specific location is not very clear. It is worth noting that the hypnotist and the magician are inside. These two occupations are notoriously high-risk occupations, they will invade quietly. Your consciousness, in your sight, people are jealous It’s dying.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger didn’t show the unsatisfactory look at the moment, but he nodded very calmly and suddenly thought: “Right, They won’t find me again this time, then come to the door?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart swayed and said: “This rest assured, their remnants in the city have been cleaned up these days. It’s over. They don’t know where we exist now.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this Su Ge’s peace of mind, I’ve come to such a group of big brothers, and there’s no fight for myself. The priest apprentice of ability is very imaginary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, what do I need to do next?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart immediately came to the spirit and said: "As an important partner, I will definitely not let you suffer and die. You only need to help through the police. I monitor the list of people who have died unexpectedly in the recent past, and at the same time, through your method, tell this message to the Church of the Holy Blood, let them believe this message, and don't expose the relationship between you and me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge heard this moment and fell into meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn’t want to be too obvious in this aspect of the Holy Blood Church, he now wants to spend the two months of internship as calmly as possible. Before becoming a formal cleric, first develop a good body and a spirit of stability and honesty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You and I are people in similar situations, so I know your sense of proportion. You will handle this thing well." Both are hidden in the Holy Blood. The heretics below the church, so at least in this respect, the two are on the common front and do not need any suspicion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge silent for a moment and nodded and said, "Okay, I will deal with this matter. Is there anything else?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, it's all." Bart said cheerfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afterwards, the two people talked about something that was not nutritious and said goodbye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your dog really opened my eyes." When parting, Bart looked at the second and said with amazement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled and asked: "Which aspect?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All aspects, my future To re-examine the creatures of dogs, they can have such a rich expression." Bart sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second side of the second hearing, the ears slightly put down, the eyes looked at the front slightly, the natural pull of the head down, put a pair of "no big deal" Expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just six o’clock at home, stepping on the bell The grid walked into the door, just to see that Ada had just taken off the white monk's robe and surrounded the apron to prepare for cooking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
