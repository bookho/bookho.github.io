			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's it, I saw this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to the description of Su Ge, There was a hint of wonder and curiosity in Shirley's demeanor: "The low-lying humans have actually set foot on the astrology? It sounds incredible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge sighs: "Who can think of it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about the book?" Shelly asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge pointed to his arms: "Before me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give me Look!" said Xue Lier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No!" Su Ge directly refused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg's answer: "This story is so wonderful, I I am afraid that you will spoil me. When the time is ripe, let's see together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pump! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, Shirley fell like a healthy leopard on the bed, and riding on him threatened: "Give me!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time Su Ge seems to be a little girl who is about to be indecent, holding her arms around her chest, don’t overdo it: "Do not give!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When looking at Su Ge's appearance at this time, Shirley didn't know why he suddenly wanted to laugh, and finally opened his mouth and touched the silver teeth: "If you don't give me, I will bite you." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bite me? See who can bite who!" Su Ge was not willing to show a weak counterattack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley is naturally rude, kneeling down, biting a bit on Suger’s shoulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bitten Su Ge hugged her with her hands and turned her down, opened the clothes on Shirley’s shoulder, facing the white and sexy shoulders. Bite down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is a pity that Shelly’s body is not the mortal body of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug bite for a long time, only feeling that he is biting a ball of water, completely useless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It hurts!" Su Ge couldn't help it anymore, hurriedly begging for mercy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl is like a little tiger in the triumph of the mouth, and he smugly said, "Give me, you can't bite me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who said it!" Su Ge still refused to show his weakness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley’s mouth smirked: “No, you can give it a try.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I try?" Su Ge confirmed unceremoniously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come on! Puppy!" Shirley seductively hooked his finger at Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge randomly bites his mouth and is going to bite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl naturally will not wait, raise his head and bite to Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But when she just raised her head, she found that her mouth was bitten by Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the intersection of the lips, the dexterous tongue beats in her mouth, and Sherry’s sharp eyes gradually become calm and the face looks comfortable and happy. Responding to Su Ge's tongue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In quiet, two people are free to ask each other for everything else, the clothes gradually recede, the majestic body and the flexible body are intertwined with each other, in a deep snoring In, it entered another scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the book, it is no longer important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;..................<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At nine o'clock in the evening, Duke was restless Walking back and forth in the living room seems to be waiting for something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today's manor is no abnormality compared to the past, but I don't know why, Duke always feels an indescribable sense of oppression that makes him uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially from the evening until now, it makes him feel the fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the evening, I don’t know why the glass on the fourth floor was suddenly broken and I didn’t see any signs of attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The servant who went to the cellar to take the ingredients seemed to step on something when he stepped down the stairs, suddenly fell and broke his leg. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the darkness of the sky, the lights on the fourth floor suddenly became useless, and even the street lights outside did not know why they began to blink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even when a painter suddenly yelled and said something, he fainted after a pale face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All kinds of signs, let Duke suddenly think of the horror monster that Su Ge and he said today, the notebook. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Duke's face under the light is a little pale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Duke." The familiar voice came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke turned to look at it, just to see his uncle, Wright looked too bad to look at himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Uncle, what's wrong?" Duke asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wright came over and asked bitterly: "When is Mr. Black Mist coming? I feel a little bit too good."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong, uncle?" Duke sounded a little nervous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wright sat down and whispered: "I just saw a vague shadow when I was drinking, and then I felt like I was over when I walked forward." The scales smashed me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, Duke’s face was even more frightened, and the voice tempted himself: “Mr. Black Mist said it’s true. ?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Stephen rushed in, his face was pale and frightened than two people: "Young Master! Young Master! I... I seem to see what monsters wander outside. It looked at me, but seemed to be afraid of what, and Didn't attack me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pump! thump! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two listened to the heartbeat more intensely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stephan’s nowadays has reached 18 points, far beyond the standards of ordinary people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his vision, you can indeed see some monsters that should not be seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why didn't it attack you!?" Wright hurriedly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stepne shook his head and said it was not clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Ke is still calm at this time, analyzes: "Before Stephen was insane, Mr. Black Mist gave him a blessing, let him go back to silence. Very It is possible that the blessings at that time are still there, and the monster is afraid of that kind of blessing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stepne nodded after listening to the agreement: "Yes! The young master said That's right, at that moment, I seem to have a small bell ringing in my ear. With the subtle bells, the monster is not looking at me, but continues to wander outside."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, the courage is relatively small, especially the face under Wright who has just experienced the life and death line once, the face is pale, sitting on the sofa with a buttocks, sweat on his forehead, pale face Some are blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke turned his head and looked out the window, and there were some constant shadows in the faint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke knows very well that it is not an illusion but a real existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because today, his vision has reached ten points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Black Mist! Come on!" Du Ke felt at this moment to collapse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Mr. Black Mist he missed was working hard with sweat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
