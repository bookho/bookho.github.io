			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ps: Starting from this chapter, each chapter is 3000 words, two every day, don't say I am lazy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you! Her Majesty, thank you for your kindness and tolerance!" The werewolves were kneeling on the ground, and the low voice was full of gratitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas nodded calmly and asked: "Now, is there anyone who has questioned what I just said?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't dare! Sinners dare not!" Suddenly, a group of nobles shook their heads in horror and hurriedly explained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jean saw that it was completely stupid, and the eyes continued to sweep on these werewolves whose consciousness returned to normal. I didn’t know what to say at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is deeply aware of the violent and desperate desire to become a werewolf form, and the sense of distortion that rationality is completely suppressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The state is any priest, and there is no way for any pastor to pray. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, in the face of these werewolves, the pope’s mouth in this sister’s mouth just said a word, and completely reversed this desperate situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sister... Who is he?" Jean asked, turning his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas’s eyes are brilliant: “It’s our hope, our dependence, the great man who shelters us!”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front, Su Ge stood alone on the wide street, keeping Wanas and a group of werewolves behind him with the momentum of a husband. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oliver is so eager to return to God at this time, his face is very ugly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord of the Month gave him half an hour to bring Vanas to the Royal Palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that the past five minutes have passed, I am stuck with the owner of the card that I will not look at in the weekdays. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't have much time, I can't continue to consume this. If this attack is not effective, I can only use that trick to be a shameful move." Oliver slowly squeezed his fist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge also wants to get the winners and losers as soon as possible. After all, the potion is only half an hour long and cannot be taken continuously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a smirk on his face, and he provoked: "I heard Master Gerlos say that you and his few fights have not fallen into the wind." I thought you were a sly character. I saw it today. I guess it is Master Geros who is too lazy to kill you, deliberately letting you run away!?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oliver heard the face sullen to the extreme. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, his greatest honor in the mysterious world has been to fight several times with the famous master demon hunter, such as Jeros, without even falling, this can even Said to be a badge event of his mysterious experience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, it’s been ridiculed by a rookie who is just a professional-level rookie, which makes him suddenly angry and his head hot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The squatting thing of your scorpion, I want you to know that I am irritating my end!" Oliver's forehead is full of blue veins, hands clasped together will be undead The book is in the middle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a horrible psionic power, Suger suddenly felt a bit distorted in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He feels awkward. When he returned to God, he found himself in a ruined graveyard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a desolate, dark, unmarried cemetery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the darkened land, the tombstones filled with dust and cobwebs are leaning against them, giving a very heavy sense of oppression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is gray and the thick lead cloud is as thick as the bricks on the wall, just looking like a sense of oppression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this...the inherent enchantment?" Suddenly came here, and Su Ge’s mind suddenly jumped out of this vocabulary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he grinned: "How could it be an inherent enchantment, it should be a trick related to illusion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking down, Su Ge accidentally found his own Both hands are empty and even the body is naked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All equipment and clothes disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whistling...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cold wind blew, but Su Ge did not follow the common sense Trembling, but a comfortable stretch of the body: "How? Want to freeze me? This is a bit difficult."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, Su Ge found next to the tombstone Suddenly some ghosts appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These devils are stunned, their eyes are white, their faces are gloomy, their mouths are fangs, and they look terrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of devils is very large, and it seems that there are at least a few thousand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Kill all the living!" After these devils appeared, their eyes instantly locked in the sleek Su Ge, rushing up like crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge grabbed both hands and found that he had no hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "These ghosts are estimated to be substantial mental attacks. If they are put here, my real world spirit is estimated to be completely fart." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thick bells came out, and countless psionic knives instantly shattered dozens of ghosts that were close, but then followed by swarming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s not good!" Su Ge continued to release the night's sharp blade to kill the devil, thinking in his mind<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;But all the slain ghosts quickly climbed out of the tombstone and continued to attack, forming an endless loop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in ten minutes, Su Ge’s forehead has already seen sweat, and the spirit is very expensive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He killed almost a thousand devils in ten minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the ghosts in this cemetery have not been reduced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;唰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unrecognized, let a devil touch the bottom of his feet, and a paw caught on Su Ge’s ankle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Su Ge felt a chilly feeling coming from the ankle, followed by a violent to indescribable sting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like his thighs are frozen and he just regained consciousness, but he was pierced into the skin by countless needles at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Severe pain, Su Ge’s left foot lost mobility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Grandma's, this is really exciting." Su Ge's face was a little pale, watching the still-ending ghosts in trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The material equipment does not come in, indicating that this is the spiritual world, not the dream world. If the gods have no effect, how can I break the game?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the situation is very dangerous, Su Ge is still calm at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The spiritual world...I am in the spiritual world..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge Thinking about... Hey! The heavy bell remembered again, and the close ghost was removed, and the Su Ge brain that heard the bell instantly felt like an electric shock, and thought of a possibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He closed his eyes and used all the knowledge of his late-time prisoners. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teach the vibration of the bell with the spirit as the medium. Since this is the spiritual world, then my night clock can be revealed!" Su Ge eyes suddenly Hey, drink a low. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, a cold and solemn atmosphere enveloped Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This breath is heavy and cold, solemn and solemn, as if standing in a solemn, empty temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, in Su Ge's body, a three-meter-high black clock suddenly appeared in the middle of Su Ge's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This clock is dark, it seems to have black iron, and there is a shallow texture on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lines are a bit messy, but you can see that there are piles of mountains, there are countless rising ghosts, there is a constant fog, and that in the fog Unclear silhouette. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touch! bump! bump! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the massive devil slammed into the bell, the body was instantly shattered by the sound that was spread. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, inside the bell, the whole spirit of Su Ge was overwhelmed by the intimidating bells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s okay, this bell is not a regular bell. Su Ge is not stunned by the violent voice at this moment, but sits calmly. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because at this moment, he heard some sounds he had never heard before, and felt the deep knowledge he had never felt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's a bit interesting, a bit interesting." Su Ge thought very excitedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time he heard a lot of voices in his ear, and in the bell he heard a lot of mourning and whispering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mourning is a ghost from the outside world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Help me! Save me..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let me free... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These devils should have been fixed here by Oliver's abilities, crushing their intellect through endless torture, making them hateful and animalistic." Flooded, it becomes the horror of today."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They can’t talk or even think. But hitting this night, the hunger in their instinct was perceived by the bell and then passed to Su Ge's ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, this night's essence is the spirit of cohesion, and has a strong knowledge of the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the mourning sound, it was the low whisper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whisper is not the soul, its source is the pattern on the night clock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is not clear about the pattern on his evening clock, he doesn't even know when these patterns were formed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he sees these patterns as their own condensation on the knowledge of the late bells, and can also be said to have obtained Su Ge from "The Evening Clock in the Valley" The spiritual representation of the formation of knowledge is the source of the power of Su Ge's late bell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to be stimulated by these souls, or the thirst for these souls, the knowledge on the night clock is actually motivated, passing out Su Ge from the book Uncoverable knowledge that cannot be touched and understood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s said very quickly, it sounds like a Buddhist scripture, and people can’t hear the numbers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Sug is very clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wu is the late-night bell, who inherits the destiny, gives the soul salvation, grants the devil to appease, gives the undead a relief, and gives the defiler death. I am the purifier of purifying the world, the guide of the deceased, the pacifier of the evil spirit, the liberator of the devil, the pacifier of the soul, the soul of the ghost spirit, the guide to the Hades, and the execution of the night bell. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Death is my robes, the night bell is my body, the sound wave is my blade, the soul is my people. I listen to the deceased Sound, interpret the soul's appeal, linger in the ocean of death, ride the boat in the late bell, walk in the abyss, and travel to and from the Hades."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am both dead, my It’s a god, I’m a law, and I’m a prisoner...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard these words, Su Ge combined his knowledge of the night clock and instantly analyzed it. There are a lot of secrets about the night bells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, these words are as engraved in the spirit of Su Ge, completely integrated with his spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
