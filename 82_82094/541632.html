			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's in the palace, Su Ge can't figure it out, but through the detection of the late bell he determined that at least four weeks are safe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where is that huge monster?" Although temporarily safe, Su Ge is still very vigilant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Running in the vast ruins for almost five minutes, two people saw the embarrassment of one of the three archbishops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cockroach at this time is hiding in a dark room that collapses in half of the room, and I don’t know how she found it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her condition is very bad, although she is not physically hurt, but her face is pale and her body is weak, even before the brown hair is white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes that were as sharp as an eagle eye were bleak at this time, and they were no longer the look of the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Archbishop! What happened to you?" Both were members of the Nighthawk Church, and the butcher was very concerned about the Archbishop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;枭 Lifting up the eyes without brilliance, said incomparably weak: "I heard some indescribable whispers that echoed throughout the city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two listened to each other and they did not hear anything at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This voice needs 60 points to hear." He added. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people heard it all the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butcher whispered: "The Archbishop, what about others? How do we go out?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp He looked up and said to the dark sky: "This is the boundary of the dream, the whole world has been eroded by dreams, or it is suppressed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;! ! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing these two people at the same time, the butcher hurriedly asked: "Here is a dream?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;He shook his head: "It is the boundary of dreams. The place where reality and dreams meet. This is not completely illusory, but it is not completely true. Here is a dream created by a terrible horror. For some reason, The dream was opened and we were dumped here.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge indulged and asked: “The Archbishop, how do we go out?”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is our spirit here, you should feel some memory faults, right?" He continued. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After being thrown down by Hugues, the people did experience a period of loss of consciousness, or memory faults. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the people returned to God, they were already in various places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In that moment, we have come to the boundary of this dream. As for our flesh, we should be placed somewhere, waiting for it. It is a bloody sacrifice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;枭 Just finished, the brow is locked, and the look is more painful. It seems that the whisper is more serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butcher will carry his back behind him and turn his head and look at Su Gedao: "We must go out as soon as possible!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg is now facing him against the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, he was very calm, even very confident, and his mouth was full of a smile, like a strategizing king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;枭 reminded him that this is a dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was like the first mysterious duel, the hypnotist who hypnotized himself told himself that he was already in a dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That time, after Su Ge’s awakening, the hypnotist died very badly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, after Su Ge wakes up, brings gifts and redemption. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close your eyes, when subjective consciousness realizes that this is a dream, Su Ge feels that the power of horror is coming to his body through the void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a huge shift in the heart of the moment that was just cautiously worried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sug!?" asked the butcher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brow is slightly wrinkled. At this moment, she feels that Su Ge has changed and is just different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug turned his head and shook his head: "Nothing, just just figured out some things. What should I do next? Let the dreams wake up through death?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, here is the boundary of dreams, where death represents real death. We need to find the "demarcation line of the realm." . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The boundary of the realm?" Su Ge was the first to hear this vocabulary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the ruins of the palace said: "The explanation is too complicated. Simple understanding is the dividing line between dream and reality and the anchor point of each other. Find the anchor. Point, we can return to reality from this dream, and this anchor is in the depths of the palace, once in the palace of Byron the Great."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" What?” asked the butcher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;枭 refers to a ruin on the inside: “It’s there.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The three quickly moved forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about the monster before?" As he advanced, Sugg remembered the harsh screams and the huge footprints on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;枭There is no answer to silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge naturally does not ask for boring questions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We can pass our thoughts to the whole world through the anchor point, and then separate the two worlds that are entangled with each other. The realm is destroyed, then fall into People in dreams can wake up directly, so this anchor is the key to our redemption of everyone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listening to the blasphemy, Su Ge did not speak, and began to use his power to explore the whole world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He soon discovered that the world is somewhat similar to the structure of the dreamland, belonging to an independent space, or in the seam of a space. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the moment when Suge explored the world, his actions seemed to alarm some horrible things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Booming...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, the violent roar echoes throughout the world, followed by The three people felt a shake of the mountain, as if something had to wake up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened??" I felt this scene, even the lord who was the lord was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butcher’s face was low, and he looked around without watching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s mouth reveals a smile, whispering: “We are going out soon.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "What!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people were faintly heard, but did not hear clearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next second...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole world is suddenly broken, everything belongs to nothing...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;here is the boundary of dreams, then explain They are in a dream of existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug is ready to manipulate this dream, discovered by the owner of the dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dream is broken with the wrath of the owner. The masters of the dream seem to have no malice against these clergy, sending them back to the normal world from the border of this dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only one person has not been sent away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or that person is not going to leave at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second has now reverted to the form of his own savage wolf king, countless hairs are like wandering ghosts, the strong body is as calm as a mountain As fast as a wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s four legs on the dark void, looking up at the front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a will, or a fragment of the will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The will has been integrated with space. He is the master of this dream, the prisoner of this dream, and the creator of dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a gray light, this will condense into its own form. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a big, earthy eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The diameter is at least ten meters, the underside of the khaki is full of raised blood vessels and lymph, disgusting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grey turbid pupil looked at Lobo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hunting!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not the voice but the spiritual communication Will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sugg sitting behind Lobo was not wearing armor, but holding the Great God’s declaration, watching the big eyes nod. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, mad hunting is dead." The big-eyed table said again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge calmly responded: "I am not dead."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, you are dead "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How did I die?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Big eyes are silent for a few seconds and say: "The mad hunting is dead."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is The fragments of the will, the memory is not complete, it only knows that the mad hunting is dead, but how it died, the cause and effect, it is not clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge did not ask, and he asked: "Why should you catch them here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It was they who broke in, Byron City was cursed The city, it can only exist in the dream, can not appear in the world." Big eyes like a machine that guards the city, calmly answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug continues to ask: "Who are you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Big eyes are silent:" I am a caretaker."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why is Byron City going in the abyss?" Su Ge asked again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Big Eyes replied: "The abyss is connected to the dream. At the beginning...the city...hidden...the abyss...I became the master here." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The memory of the big eyeball has been sorted out. Many things have been deleted in the middle of this sentence, but it is very smooth when I say it, I think I remember Very clear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But there are too many details in the middle that it can't be said. You can only skip this paragraph and then continue to say it by silence, just like when you read the text. It’s not a word that you can’t read.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge has a basic understanding of its situation: “This time Byron City appeared, is it with some sacrifices? Relationship?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Yes.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After answering, big eyes feel a little wrong, ask Road: "Why do I answer your question?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because I am the king of mad hunting." Su Ge said seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The mad hunting is dead."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not dead."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dead"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do I die?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is dead anyway."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the topic returned to the beginning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about Byron the Great? Since you have the ability to rule this dream, then the power is inherited from the dream of the great god Byron the Great?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Big Eyes directly asks: "Who is Byron the Great?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... Byron the Great is this The former owner of the city, isn’t it that Byron the Great allowed you to guard this place?” Su Ge asked strangely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Big Eyes Answer: "What is the relationship between Byron and Byron? This is my world, I am here just because I want to be here." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After answering, it silences: "Why should I answer your question?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" ............"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge did not carry out the previous cycle, calmly said: "You can also ask me a few questions, I will answer you." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Big eyes slowly took a look at Su Ge and asked, "How can you control my world?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because I am the master of dreams." Su Ge replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Big eyeballs sighed: "Would you like hunting?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge With a twitch in the corner of his eye, he has foreseen that if the answer is yes, it is estimated that it will fall into the same cycle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he said, "My name is Suger Sotos."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Big eyes Another sigh, said: "Yug Sotos is not dead."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;! ! ! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this Su Ge eyes suddenly stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
