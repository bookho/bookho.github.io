			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one knows how the undead is formed. Even the three churches, Cabatos College can't understand the secret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People only know that undead people have lived for a long time and can't die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even killed by a broken body, after experiencing enough time, he will still climb out of a coffin, but will lose all memories of his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost all undead people have mental illnesses, because long years are prone to schizophrenia or depression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there are also some unwilling people who are determined to be self-conscious and will remember all the important things that they have experienced in their long years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ryan is one of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a mystery and warrior, he has no talent, no savvy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he has a good memory. He relies on the accumulation of knowledge that he does not know for many years, step by step to the position of the leader of the lord, and masters many secrets of ancient times. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the secrets is related to Glen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s still the peak of the undead dynasty. To be precise, it’s time for them, not the undead, just ancient humans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ancient six kings ruled the mainland, and the Yi people were only inferior creatures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because there were only two overlords of that era. Dragons, and ancient humans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the most glorious and magnificent era, and it is also a tragic era. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the six kings has come to the peak, even if they have surrendered the dragon to become the real hegemon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a loss of external troubles, and internal disturbances naturally grew. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The six kings with eternal life began an endless battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Innumerable years, the Six Kings campaign has caused countless people to die, the people have been displaced, and the land is ridiculous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until one day, everyone heard a long bell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bell didn’t know where it came from, nor how it came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first, people didn't care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But three days later, Lean, who was just twenty years old, witnessed the deepest shadow of his countless years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wuyang City is one of the six kings. He was the guard of the city gate at the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that day, I suddenly saw countless black feathers falling from the sky like black snowflakes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This feather is clear and dark, but it gives an indescribable clean and holy, black without a trace of impurities, black like the purest death and nothingness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, they suddenly found a burst of bells full of death coming from the palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three beeps first, three more, and three more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are very clear about what this bell represents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bell is the bell that will sound at the funeral, it is the night clock for funeral. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the six kings of the Sun King, suddenly violent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few days, the other five kings of the city also scattered the black feathers, and the bells of the funeral. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The six kings who symbolize eternal and flames collectively violent at the same time, cursed the land by the endless war dead souls they have been suppressing, cursing the time All the living. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun is falling and the world is welcoming the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long memories flashed in Ryan’s mind for a moment. At this point he looked at the delicate black feathers in front of him, and he felt his body tremble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a fear of instinct. He is obedient to the instinct between the electric and the flint, and the body is momentarily far away, returning to the side of the Holy Father. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The goddess is on, what is this ghost thing!?" The clerics around him are completely stupid at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Su Ge still stood there, but countless fearful deaths rushed around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four huge black wings stretched out like an ancient demon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呼呼呼<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless blue mists that don’t know where to appear, surrounded by Su Ge . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few seconds later, a dark sleeved, hunting robes appeared on Su Ge's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fog gradually gathered in the head of Su Ge and connected to the robes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a huge hood that shaped the head of Su Ge into a big mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The drooping hood and the robes of the robes just leave a gap between the eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hula! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dark, a pair of eyes burning with ice blue and wildfire suddenly appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After entering the master, the understanding of the law of death and the soaring spirit can further improve Su Ge’s death form, not only to grow wings, Also put on the foggy robes that could not be worn before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! Boom! Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thick bells of the bells continued to spread from Su Ge's body, and a group of clergymen looked up in amazement, only to find that there were countless dark feathers scattered around them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is!!!" The three lords of the lords are all acquainted with the goods, and they are very aware of how strange Sugg's current form is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this form, it is similar to the ten fuzzy ghosts in the ancient city of Asia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regular physical attacks and mysterious attacks have no effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg slowly raised his hand at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The invisible scent of death spreads out and instantly ruins the entire tent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tent was silent and disappeared, and other clerics outside saw Sugna’s strange figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪嗒...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, these clergymen began to increase again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Add more than three points and add a little less. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bells spread with the black breath, and the range of black feathers quickly enveloped the entire camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cough and cough...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A burst of intense coughing sounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Archbishops suddenly found that many clergymen were pale and their bodies became weak and weak, as if they had been seriously ill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the breath of death! These breaths of death are eroding our lives!" he said in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Looking for death!" Laurie was furious and turned into a black gas and flew directly to Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge pinched the pistol, his body slammed into the sky and escaped Laurie’s attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four dark wings fluttered in the sky, and Su Ge flew in the air, matching the dead feathers that floated around, like the god of death descending from the sky, overlooking the beings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the ground, Moore looked at this scene with wide eyes, and his face was shocked with an indescribable excitement and joy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Bells is more direct, he is now clasped with his hands, and hurriedly bowed his head and prayed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This form does not know that people who have traveled to the Holy Land in the lake naturally know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the lake fairy is their object of worship, and the existence of this form is the object of worship of the fairy in the lake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lance, your vision is really accurate, I am waiting for the expectation of redemption, it is in it!" Bells has already blossomed in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with two people, other people can’t be too bad. I feel that the horrible death scent slowly erodes my body but I can’t do anything to see the vitality. Constantly disappearing from the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this critical moment, the Holy Word even said three words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Expulsion, purification, shelter!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; suddenly, a green light, a white light, a The blue light appeared at the same time, forming a huge cover that actually blocked the death feather of Su Ge completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the clerics infected with death are quickly recovering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug saw this, and the heart said: "It’s not a lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He!" Laurie shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;枭 After listening to the eyes flashing a strange light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, her eyes are opposite to Sugna’s cold eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How do you want to die?" Su Ge's indifferent voice sounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, the inspiration is like an explosion, telling her to close her eyes in a hurry, don't answer! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, the pair of beautiful and sharp eyes filled with bloodshot eyes, hurriedly closed his eyes and bowed his head, and could not answer a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking awkwardly, Laurie was shocked, but as the archbishop of the church, he must come forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the body once again turned into darkness and rushed directly into the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Su Ge did not intend to fight because he could not beat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s only 70% of his psionic power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was another way of using oneself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of the black air that flew, Su Ge raised his right hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哗啦啦! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A burst of ice blue flame suddenly appeared, like a splash of water burning into the labor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at this flame, Laurie’s eyes tightened, and his inspiration told him that the flame was more dangerous than the half-lord’s hoarfrost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, the speed of this flame is not fast, he instantly found a gap and rushed out. When he was ready to continue the attack, he suddenly felt a cold wind and did not know when it appeared. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the cold wind suddenly turned into a demon-like dog's head, opening his mouth is a more terrifying frost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This moment, the temperament of Laurie wants to swear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many years, he has not eaten so much under a master, and the attack is everywhere! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, anger is angry, he dare not provoke this horrible chill, the road is blocked, he can only come back from the sky with gray face . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he looked up again, Su Ge had been stunned by countless people, accompanied by a burst of black feathers and cold wind, disappearing into the sky, leaving only the horrible deterrence and the aftermath of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the ground, the feathers that died and condensed have not yet dispersed. Everyone is dumb, and they can't speak at the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cough and cough...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From time to time, there are people who cough twice, it is killed Temporary sequelae left after the breath of corrosion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In silence, Moore’s calm voice sounded: “I declare on behalf of the Fortress that I will not participate in any discussion of the Church of the Night Bell. The Bain City incident will conduct an in-depth investigation. I will report this matter, the incident and the chain reaction, the Church of the Holy Blood must give a statement."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, Moore turned and steadily left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside the first, Baines first bowed, then seriously said: "The Elf Order will not participate in any crusade about the church, and withdraw from this The second church alliance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, don't wait for the three archbishops to talk and turn around and follow Moore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these two people, Dark Star and other people are very ugly, and the three bishops are even more ugly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big joke that I just said is now realized in front of so many people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Children, what else do you want to say?" At this time, the Holy Father was full of exhausted voices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three people shook their heads at the same time, did not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Resume, there is battle tomorrow." The Holy Father said and turned and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people looked up and found that the body of the Holy Father was awkward, and his back was full of loneliness and loneliness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that a poor old man who is completely disappointed with his children seems to be a kind person who has been cruelly betrayed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
