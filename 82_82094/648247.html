			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the woman’s return home, time has come to 11:30 midnight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge leaned on the couch and gasped for a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the party, Su Ge sharply found some clues and saw a young man seduce by a beautiful and attractive woman, no one In the case of attention, leave from the south gate of the mansion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug immediately bid farewell to everyone to follow up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his inspiration is not wrong, this woman is indeed a ghoul, and intends to sacrifice this youth as a sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what made him really happy and unexpected was the encounter with Anthony and Marlene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland is in the church at night, and now she knows the true identity of Su Ge and has seen several times with Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Anthony and Marlene have not seen each other for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last time, two people were polluted, if not Su Ge has become a monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What makes Suge happy is that two people actually defeated the demons, came to the expert level, and became elite senior clergy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old friend met Sog really happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony, Marlene, Marx, Bobby, Rogan These are the best friends when he was the weakest and experienced hardships together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these people, Su Ge has a special feeling, just like playing from small to big hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows these two people very well, they are really good people, real clergy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s the expectation that Su Ge will be able to see that two people are getting better and better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's great to see you here." Although Su Ge wanted to recognize them, he had a good time together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he is very aware of his particularity today, the Church of the Holy Blood is too strange, and Su Ge does not know whether they have the means to peep into memory and soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If so, it will not only threaten your own safety, but even the three of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Sog’s very sensible choices don’t know, after all, I’m happy to see them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he burned one-third of his psionic power directly, and launched the power of the Holy Grail of the soul to confuse the three people and quickly leave with the ghoul Take the Duke's carriage back home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about smirking?" Shelley walked down the stairs while Sugg leaned on the couch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge Convergence smiled and said: "I saw a few old friends and I was very happy to see them."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley sighed, and then the woman directly locked her eyes in the black cloth wrapped her body, her face was a little displeased: "Why is this dirty and ugly thing here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge raised his right hand and said, "I need to know some information from her mouth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the end, Su Ge stood up, and the shining light on the glove was placed on the woman's forehead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Soul mastery." Su Ge said four words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the spread of these four words, an unspeakable light shrouded the woman's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Su Ge’s psionic energy instantly consumed 50%. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability to launch the Holy Grail of the Soul is very consuming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A method that just confuses three professional mysteries at the same time consumes 30% of his psionic power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, if you completely master a person's soul through the Holy Grail of the Soul, you need 50% of his psionic power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This horrible consumption is only able to withstand the sacred mark of the "lake", his psionic power is five times that of ordinary people. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After being mastered, the woman opened her eyes in confusion, looked at Su Ge with no eyes, and respectfully said: "Great master, your servant Listen to your order."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded and asked directly: "What organization do you belong to?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "I belong to the cold-hearted church, is a high-level ritual." The woman respectfully answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why do you want to sacrifice in this way?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our great Lord, the god of sinister bones, the king of ghouls longs for sacrifices. As a high-level ritual, I need to prepare sacrifices in advance, and wait until the sacrifice day. Come and contribute enough sacrifices."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the sacrifice day?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Sacrifice Day is an important holiday for us to chill out the church. On this day, we can give the gods a gift by offering enough sacrifices to the gods." The woman replied with a sluggish answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger continues to ask: "How many people have been deployed in the capital city, do you know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I don't know, I only know a few compatriots who often communicate." The woman said truthfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you know a master male ghoul?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman immediately replied: "Know, he is Glei, a master ghoul, the occupation is the master of the sacrum, he is our three here. One of the leaders."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are your purposes here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Finding Our Holy Grail."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Belongs to your holy grail?" Su Ge browed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman calmly replies: "Yes, belongs to our Holy Grail."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The Holy Grail of the Cold? Tell me." Su Ge has an interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman explained: "According to the church records, the cold-blooded church originated from the north wind continent, and it should be a long time ago, even before the gods, the great cold king. The Holy Grail was discovered underground, and the cold empire was established. With the power of our ghouls, we swept the world and became the hegemon of the world at that time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Su Ge also heard this argument for the first time: "Go ahead."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In that era our ghoul was regarded as a beast, human Friends, the messengers of the gods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You ugly guys feel really good about themselves." Su Ge said unceremoniously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman calmly replies: "It's not that we feel good about ourselves, but that we are real."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Why?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman replied: "The war in that era has been constant, people's treatment level is very low, after every war, there will be a horrible plague to take away countless people and livestock. Life. When people are unable to survive because of these problems, the cold king took us ghouls from the north wind continent by airship and came to the rest of the world. We eliminated the vast majority of the dead bodies by the war. The plague. And because of the Holy Grail, we have a very strong frost property at that time, so we can eliminate many germs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It can even be said to be Because we, humans and other animals have begun normal large-scale reproduction."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge was amazed but accepted and believed in this theory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The absolute mastery of the soul makes it absolutely impossible for a woman to lie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question just mentioned is also well-founded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
