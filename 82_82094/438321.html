			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Sug came over, it was just that Evan was looking far away and seemed to be watching someone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan has returned to God and smiled and said, "Guess who I have met?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Judy Palmer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp When he heard the name, Su Geton smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can say that this name is very, very profound, because this woman has changed her destiny and made her a mediocre life into a new world. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without her original refusal, Su Ge would not join the death sect, and would not die, nor would he be the present. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, although profound, he does not have any gratitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She doesn't seem to know that you are back. I just saw her when I passed by her rich boyfriend. I said that I would hold a class meeting two days later. I am going," Evan said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You promised?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why don't you agree? What she did to you at the beginning I will remember for a lifetime." When it comes to this, Evan's tone is not good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge patted him on the shoulder and did not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whisper of Evan's eyebrow dance: "Life itself is meaningless. Only by forcing you can understand the true meaning of human nature. Su Ge, the day after tomorrow, go with me. Let's give the skunk a big surprise!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg had intended to refuse after listening to it, after all, he had passed the savage and eager to win. Years old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after thinking about it, I suddenly felt that this classmate would seem a coincidence, so I promised: "Oh, I will prepare for the time."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's right! This is the causal cycle. When they made that kind of disgusting thing, they should be ready to repay!" Evan pinched his fist and said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then two people went around for a while, and at two o'clock in the afternoon, the two separated and prepared their own things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the cathedral, Father Hank rushed over and looked ugly: "Bishop, something went wrong."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened?" Su Ge asked calmly. Father Hank immediately said: "Father Anthony and Mother Marlene were attacked by unknowns in the past, and the overall spirit was greatly traumatized." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fast past!" Su Ge was shocked and hurried toward the medical district. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the way, Father Hank said the result of this action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bryce seems to be scared again, the book he said has been completely lost. Prince Jean is in a coma, Father Anthony and Mother Marlene It seems to have been polluted by some kind of power. At this time, the attitude is very mad and even caused three ordinary citizens to be injured."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge listened to a more gloomy face:" Where was the attack?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“On the front street of the Bryce home, a ruin of a sanatorium that just caught fire.” Hank replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of Su Ge, the stars are disillusioned, and the light shines like a meteor. Then he asks: "What about Bryce?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems to have been scared, sitting there motionless, without any mental reaction and mental fluctuations."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, I know "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After five points, two people came to the ward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two beds in a relatively small ward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the hospital bed, Father Anthony and Mother Marlene, who had been given sedatives, lay on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is very calm, the body and limbs of both people are firmly tied up by the strong canvas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The effect is very deep, this is already the limit of the ability to inject sedatives, and then increasing the dose will cause damage to the brain. You be careful, two people It’s only relatively calm now, and if it is stimulated by any other stimulus, it will rise directly.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, just as Su Ge was just near the bed, The bodies of the two men began to struggle fiercely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can see that two people are blue at this time, and their eyes seem to be covered by something, gray. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expression is extremely embarrassing, the eyes of the eyes are slightly cracked, the big mouth reveals the white teeth, accompanied by the snoring of the saliva, issued For a moment like a snake, like a dog, like a wolf's non-human screaming, like being possessed by two devils. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey! Kill! Eat! Eat you!" Father Anthony stared at Su Ge, and the two lines of blood flowed down the corner of his eye, matching his It looks like awkward and horrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Heart! Brain! Eat you!" Ms. Marlene struggled as she struggled, constantly raising her head to bite at Su Ge, two beds for two people to struggle. It’s screaming, the danger of falling apart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bishop, be careful!" Father Hank stood in the distance noting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly, took a deep breath, lifted his cane and slammed it on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thick, percussive sound came out, and the invisible ripples spread around the center of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two struggling bodies suddenly become stagnant, then gradually relax their bodies, close their eyes and mouth, and the horrible expression gradually calms down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hank saw the scene suddenly surprised, and then felt the incomprehensible familiarity of this sound, it seems to have heard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, another bell rang, a kind of gentle and heavy, soothing people, the solemn and solemn bell came again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At this time..." Hearing this voice, Father Hank suddenly thought of something, with a violent shock on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge turned his head and smiled at Father Hank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father Hank immediately relieved and sighed: "At the time, his disappearance was never accidental, I should have thought of it."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has heard this sound very similar to the original bell that cleans tens of thousands of souls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only in terms of style and sound quality, but more of the magical effect of soothing the mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this bed, two people slowly opened their eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can see that the grayish white material of the eyes of two people has not disappeared, which makes the two people seem to have cataracts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, Su Ge." Anthony said hoarsely.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marin Chang Shuyi Mouth, muttered: "I know that there will be such a day, but when I get up and experience, it really makes people feel endless despair and fear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Su Ge reached out and used the psionics to check the situation of the two people. "You two take a break, let me go to see Jean."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Su Ge found that two people were mentally contaminated with some strange filthy substances that seemed to taint a piece of white ink, not only attached to it, but even incorporated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s night of the soul of the town can only make two people beasted and awakened, but can’t clear the two people’s mentally contaminated material. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people nodded slightly and closed their eyes and stopped talking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge did not rush to tie two people, turned to Hanke and asked: "What about Jean?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the next door." Hank said, Take Sug into the room next door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a standard single-person ward where Jean is lying calmly and his body is helped by the cloth, just in case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge went over and checked and found that there was nothing wrong with Jean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And mentally, due to the long appeasement of the late bell and its special form, it was only traumatized and did not receive pollution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge did not rush to wake him up and went out and asked, "What about other clergymen?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Total madness two, the people who were rushed to kill on the spot, the remaining three people died directly." Father Hank said quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hula! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark eyes slammed into the blue flames, and the expression remained calm, but the calmness was cold and cruel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his eyes, these people are already his men and his friends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having suffered such a huge trauma made him very angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father Hank saw the Su Ge at this time, the body instinct took a step back, and the expression was shocked and somewhat fearful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge blinked at this moment and the flame disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Taking a deep breath, Su Ge said calmly: "Nothing, just a little angry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Hank sighed with relief: "Does Bryce need to look at it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now is not the time to deal with him." Su Ge said faintly Ready to go back to the ward to ask about the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bishop Su Ge! What is this?! I am very kind and cooperative, let you use my people, why is this happening!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ner's voice was very unpleasant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug turned his head and saw that Nell’s face was gloomy and he was very uncomfortable with someone coming over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While walking, Nell asked with a loud voice: "I am asking you! Su Ge Sotos! Where is Anthony and Marlene who attacked civilians? Call out, I want to give the people an account."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just got the news, actually said that his clerics madly attacked civilians, which made him very angry, Then I heard that it was actually Suge’s instructions, which made him even more angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn't care how many priests die, and doesn't care how many people sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dead priests are dedicated to the goddess and can earn their reputation and face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the two mad priests have tarnished their faces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the leadership of the genius bishop of the Stars of Heaven, there will be mad priests, which is unforgivable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially the one that caused this kind of thing is the one that makes you very upset! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of Nair’s questioning, Su Ge’s indifferent turn calmly said: “I have important things to do next, no time to tell you that it’s useless. Nonsense, you better not bother me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sug Sotos! You are a citizen, pay attention to your identity!" Nell's face is gloomy , whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug slowly turned around, holding his cane in front of his hands, and the eyes under the black cap stared coldly at Nell: "Don’t challenge me. The limit of your patience, Nell."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nell saw Su Ge’s eyes and momentum at this time, and immediately breathed a sigh of relief, a kind of himself was completely The humiliation and anger of repression broke out from the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
