			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to Moore’s introduction, Su Ge leaned on the back of the soft chair, with a hint of curiosity on his face: “Listen to what you said, I am somewhat looking forward to meeting these figures of urban legends."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moore answered seriously: "Believe me, after the first encounter, You won't want to meet them for the second time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two did not go into too much on this topic, Moore said: "For the disaster The city, what I know now has already said, and then you will judge it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yellow said with a satisfied face: "It is very comprehensive, It is also very practical, I am very satisfied."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that, Su Ge asked: "In your intelligence, you know who spread the news and tell those Ordinary mystery?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moore said directly: "Intelligence is a lot of letters, and the source of these letters is the ancient city of Aya."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp; "This time behind the scenes is called Shirley Byron Diaz." Su Ge said calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Byron Diaz!?" Moore’s eyes were a little shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge continued: "This is the source of the event is the behemoth of Byron the Great, as you told me. Byron the Great has been in contact with the Holy Grail, and They want to use the Holy Grail document to reclaim the Holy Grail by means of sacrifice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is this possible!" Without any hesitation, Moore uttered a denial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looked at him: "There is nothing impossible. The entire ancient city of Aaron is a Byron Dias, with the blood power as an introduction. In the soul and flesh of hundreds of mysterious people, are you saying that it is possible?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moore's fingers are constantly moving, the brow is locked: "Then they ...they are..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge said: "She said a word to me, the so-called big event, not letting others know it. It’s a big event. The whole thing is actually a conspiracy in a conspiracy. Their purpose is to attract the mysterious people and help them complete the sacrifice. The previous fluctuations, those variations are just what they want to attract mysterious people. Create momentum."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is playing with fire, how can a city rival the three great churches and so many mysteries!" Moore frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug turned his head and looked out the window, just to see a few people wearing robes riding a horse and rushing, very hurried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a slight irony smile on the corner of his mouth: "It’s because of this kind of thinking, or this illusion can attract more people. If it is strong enough Desperate, who dares to go? Humanity, that's it. Bullying is hard, hard to fish, intrigue, and luck, the more people, the weaker the combat power, isn't it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Molton was gloomy: "Is this thing so?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Be prepared for the toughest, rich and dangerous." This is a game of chess. Everyone wants to be a chess player, not a cannon fodder. Then it depends on who is smart enough." Su Ge laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moore listened and looked at him: "You are also a fish in the water, and you are lucky."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Su Ge did not care, looked at him and smiled and said: "I was originally such a person, fighting with people, it is endless fun, isn't that the pleasure of being a person?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With shocking news, Moore silently returned to his carriage, and he and others did not say whether he would report to Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he just said, this is human nature. Even if you know the problem, it will only make more people rush to gather here to fish in troubled waters. Fortunately, you will become the profitable fisherman and you can get benefits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is also one of these people, but his means and vision are higher and his chances of success are greater. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a very calm road. From time to time, there are galloping horses or horses carrying dust all the way, and rushing to the misty mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moore is also anxious, but Su Ge is not in a hurry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After several suggestions were invalid, Moore bid farewell to Su Ge and speeded up, hoping to get some on-site intelligence as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At ten o'clock in the evening, Su Ge's carriage was not nearly as slow as three-quarters of the journey, and then the bright moonlight could even see the criss-crossing ridge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge did not rush to move forward, but corrected in place and slept. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I returned to the Kingdom of God in my dreams, I just saw that Jerous stood there and seemed to be waiting for someone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait for me?" Sug went over and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerousus nodded and said directly: "The foggy mountains are now very chaotic, except for the cure, the two churches of the Nighthawks, the Glorious Church, the Cold Church. According to Randall’s investigation, at least one hundred and thirty treasure hunters and explorers have come, and more than a dozen battles have erupted at dusk.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ; &nbsp; Su Ge nodded: "I am not bad with my analysis, are you both right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss smiled: "These days I and Randall has thoroughly thoroughly understood this, and it is well understood."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg was very happy at the end, and said with a happy face: "I don't know what to do." It is Master Gerlos!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, more is Randall's credit, he can fly, there are many bats to make the devil, the road is too convenient. "Jerouss is not a man who is working. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled and nodded: "The Lord will reward him. Is there any other information?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Jerouss Convergence smiled and said: "There are two intelligences, all related to the witch."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s heart: "Please say."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Glorious Church is tracking a witch, codenamed Sonic. The Lengbu Church is also tracking a witch, codenamed Frost. These two witches are masters, the Whelp Relief The veteran."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unable to wait for Sug to speak, Gerlos continued: "I just got an unfortunate news that the witch who coded Frost has been caught by the Nighthawk Church. Living, they are locked in their camp and seem to be ready to die at the right time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge’s eyes flashed a glimmer of light: “The master witches are important assistants, and they are the witch rescuers, which makes it easier for us to reach more witches. We must save the witch.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerousus nodded: "Well, so I will come back and ask what you mean and plan."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Another witch? ?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss shook his head: "This is not clear, but Randall looked at it roughly. There are no signs of a witch in the mountains. The witch may still be on the way. , or at the outskirts of the mountains."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will pay attention to this. We expect to go to the foot of the mountain at about 10 o'clock tomorrow morning, you and Randall can come first Convergence," said Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss indulged: "My suggestion is not for the round, we can act as a dark hand outside. If you plan to rescue the witch, you definitely need some outside." Help, you can't save the witch as the Church of the Holy Blood."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge said, nodded: "Well, we are still in the dream "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, Gerlos hurried away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation is relatively complex and changeable now, he doesn't have much time to stay in sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a throne, Su Ge raised his hand and found that there was a large amount of golden faith in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Having the power of these beliefs seems to allow the country of God to escalate further." Su Ge thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, he suddenly felt that someone was pushing his body and seemed to wake himself up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a group of low-level guys!" Su Ge said, quickly detaching from his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open your eyes and see Alger standing on the side of his carriage and whispering, "The bishop, something went wrong."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There was a movement on the edge of the camp, Hills chased it out, had been out for half an hour, haven’t come back yet, I I didn’t dare to chase it out, so I woke you up.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge heard a sudden jump in his heart, suddenly sat up and rushed out with two ha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait here!" Su Ge said that the night bell suddenly spread. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; found that within a radius of 50 meters, there is no human being at all, and even any mysterious traces are not left behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn! Lobo!" Su Ge suddenly gloomy and said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hills is like a sister to him, they are the core driving force for Su Ge's initial stage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that Hills is suddenly missing, Suger is a little impatient. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, Lobo’s nose could smell the smell of Hills and screamed at Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug immediately chased Luobo and rushed out, while rushing to the side and constantly releasing the aftermath of the evening bell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no matter how you perceive, you can't feel any situation, and a group of dead silences are like the aftermath of the late night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a man and a dog ran around for about a hundred meters, Luo Bo seemed to suddenly feel something, suddenly stunned, the body rushed into a cave . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's go! Let go! You damn wolf, I don't want to kill you, let go!" A burst of low female voice came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who! Come out!" Su Ge snorted, and the violent night bell burst directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Larry followed the back of Laurie and opened his eyes, just following A dozen of Su Ge’s sorcerers were suddenly shattered by the horrible night clock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
