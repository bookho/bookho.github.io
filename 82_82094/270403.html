			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The mysterious battles in the city are very frequent, and the destructive power of some mysterious duels is amazing because of the existence of the dragon flame believers. The palace is not safe, and now many assassins In order to lay a high reward for the Queen's head, the running dogs of the Duke of the Mountain are always staring at the palace, trying to seize the opportunity of a blow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Illina is very familiar with the situation in the city, giving Su Ge nothing to explain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although there are crises everywhere, one thing is more interesting. It is that the nobility in the city is very safe. No one wants to shoot this noble because they have mastered it. 70% of the wealth of the whole kingdom is the core assistant of their future rule. Those people are mostly tempted and wooed for the nobility, so you will find a magical phenomenon after entering, and the battle next door will not be handed over. There will be endless streams of communication."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are even two or three princes from neighboring countries who come and personally continually lobby the queen to marry. As a result of the appearance of these princes, the little sisters of the nobles dressed up and rushed to various social dance parties, hoping to let the prince see themselves. Sometimes you can see a killer in the distance just killing people, will be human The head is cut and taken away, and the ladies here are drawing art portraits."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge imagined the scene and then sighed: "I can’t imagine , it’s really distorted "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illina laughed: "It's normal. The upper class never cares about the life and death of the underlying people. I have seen this kind of thing long and I am used to it." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is easy to say, but Su Ge can feel how much pain and suffering she has experienced in the past ten years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, no other churches come to lobby, let the Queen accept their asylum?" Su Ge remembered his main purpose this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illina sat up with both hands and said: "Of course, but most of them are blunders, such as elf churches, such as the Glorious Church. Their main Power is not radiated here, even if they want support, when they come, it is already cold here. The situation here is too complicated, not one or two elite teams can solve it."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge agreed to nod and asked: "What about the three churches?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The three churches have many complicated agreements with each other, Guinness is Under the tentacles of the Church of the Holy Blood, the Church of the Healing and the Church of the Nighthawks had no right to intervene. As for the Holy Blood Church, it was twice, and it was rejected by the Queen." Elena said this face. The irony seems to be that she was there at the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge tempted: "I have heard of some ancient legends, saying that there is deep hatred in the royal family of the Guinness and the Church of the Holy Blood." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illina’s red eyebrows were picked up and asked unexpectedly: “Who did you listen to?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Unintentionally listening to people, I don't know if it is true or not." Su Ge spread his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illina did not answer and did not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, I have investigated the folklore here. I heard that this is the hometown of the god of death. Do you know what this is?" Su Ge asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illina asked nodded and said, "How much do I know about this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Talk about it!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“According to the legend, there were a number of gods in ancient times that were changed by people, and they gained a lot through unknown means. Knowledge breaks the limits of human thinking, breaks away from the human form, and enters the degree of the gods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These are in contact with the source, relying on their own mastery The knowledge has made the source of this knowledge, and the god of death has changed from human to god, and finally to the source of death and the concept of death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Since it was a human being, it naturally exists in the hometown. The existence is too strange and has exceeded the limits of human understanding. His relationship exceeds material and acts on causality. The person born here in the rumor is dead. After the god, the causal link in the meditation acts on the land of his hometown, making his hometown full of richness. The breath of death. The people here are sheltered by the god of death, their lifespan is prolonged, their land is not allowed to have any undead and grievances, and even the mysterious people appearing here are far more than others in feeling the knowledge of death. People in the area."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge looked surprised and asked: "Is this all legends?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irene looked at him with a smile and said, "But after many years The verification, people really found out that all the things in the legend are true. The most obvious is the death sects that have been established here and once had the power of terror. These people will even use the knowledge of death even more than three. The church is behind you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The death sect was born here?" Su Ge was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yeah, but it has grown stronger since then, and slowly hidden the source here. The death sects have become more and more powerful in previous years. They were killed by the three churches, and now they are four-strength and they are rolling back here to cultivate their health."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge will This clue is sorted out and asked: "So what did you hear about the smell of death?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The thing, the legend is there. In the rumor, the deified form of death, that is, the body that faded after becoming a god, was buried in the land of the hometown. As the deification deepened, his body was given the concept of death along with causality. The rules are decomposed and scattered in every corner of the homeland, proclaiming their existence to the world and future generations, and the breath of the god of death is the result of the aggregation of scattered and scattered rules."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But it’s not easy to summon this thing, even the legend does not exist. The breath of God it death. How do you suddenly ask this question? "Elaine asked, curious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge indulged, or briefly said what happened when he came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The damn death sect!" After listening to Elena's face, she was so angry that she couldn't wait to cramp these people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg asked: "What effect does this have? Is it harmful?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Elena shook her head: "I don't know this very well. After entering the capital in detail, I went to find the tile... I went to someone to ask."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge heard a hint of concealed smile on the corner of the word "Wa", at this time he has basically confirmed the identity and strength of Elena. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
