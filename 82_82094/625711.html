			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the morning, Su Ge, as always, was doing morning exercises in the yard, watching the sun rise slowly as he stretched his muscles, and realized the special beauty of this morning alternation. feel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two people’s exercise today was not disturbed. After the two bodies stretched out their bodies and limbs, they were relieved and refreshed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Life really is exercise, stretching the muscles of the body in the morning, feeling the whole person has to float." Su Ge said at the red light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley is as usual, even the sweat is not a drop: "Life is that exercise is only effective for humans such low-level creatures, that kind of advanced creatures, even if It’s the deep dive, and the moon beasts you’ve encountered before, and they don’t need excessive movement.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge has become accustomed to Shelly This kind of blow, without hesitation, said: "If I become a disgusting thing in order to become a senior, I would rather die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You see The disgusting, does not mean that thing is really disgusting, what you think is good, the beauty you think does not mean that they are really good and beautiful." Xue Lier corrected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug said with a serious counterattack: "But you are really beautiful, this is a fact that cannot be argued!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley listened to his rosy lips, and said with a beautiful voice: "Eating."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, turned and walked into the house . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the simple breakfast, Bernice still did not stop to go out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But today she is not going out with Tracy, but is busy with her business. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benice is not supported by any nobles, but can live in such a sophisticated apartment, where the money is not the church’s financial support, but she earns herself Come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has a tailor-made shop that is not very large and is not very small. She customizes clothes for some elites and small nobles through her own aristocratic channels. And design dresses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of her relationship with the Tsui Xi, plus the design of the things really good, have a good sales and reputation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Bernice’s report, her tailor’s shop’s net income per month can reach 800 francs, which is also counted in the capital. The income is on the top. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Bernice left, Betty slammed the song to clean up the room, then picked up the basket and went out to buy lunch and dinner ingredients. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Betty’s daily life is very monotonous, cleaning the house, cooking, planting flowers, and watching home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But these things make her happy, not the slightest annoyance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled at this energetic and lively girl, and at this moment, he also faintly felt the special aura of this girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two people are not in a hurry to go out today, Su Ge is sitting in the chair of the living room, bathing in the warm sunshine, ready to read the book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the book in his hand was the "Frenzy Book" that almost made him into a crazy book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one of the external scripts of The Book of Assos, there is a lot of hidden knowledge and secrets, which is what Su Ge is craving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Home's Shirley is wearing a black lace-trimmed slim dress, full of rounded hips sitting on the armrests of Su Ge's left side, leaning against him Looking down at the books in Su Ge's hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you still have this book?" Shelly saw this accident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first time Su Ge has come up with this book for a year and a half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s face nodded with a dignity: “On the way to the ancient city of Aya, I glanced at it. I was almost mad at the time. I had been worried for a while. The depth of the Holy Grail of the Soul has made my inspiration significantly improved. Now I feel that I can read this book."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl White The arm grabbed Su Ge's neck, and the white sleek chin was placed on the top of Su Ge. He said, "Open it, just sit idle and I will see it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;Shirley is full of interest in everything that is related to Assos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the desire to exist instinct, and... fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening the frantic book that still has a faint bloody taste, Su Ge once again saw the strange lines that made him almost crazy last time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the soaring knowledge and vision, Sog’s insight and affordability are no longer comparable to the original Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, looking at these strange and crazy lines, Su Ge can actually see a few lines of distorted characters in this line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is frenzied? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the threshold to madness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the key to giving up reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the knowledge that frees itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this, Su Ge feels a little uncomfortable, but The vision did not grow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley grinned: "Let's make a mystery."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, she sticks her tongue out I took a look at my index finger and turned it over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I don’t care, I’m more anxious than Su Ge to see what’s going on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turned to the second page, Su Ge brows slightly when turning pages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This page seems to be stuck with a strange thing. When you turn the page, you can see a lot of red and sticky things between the page and the page. Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just like thick blood, as the pages of the book open, even stretched red sticky silk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this ghost thing?" asked Su Ge's brow furrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley took the book of frenzy at this time, and then the body quickly retreated into the shadows, and countless darkness rushed to eat the book of frenzied directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗷呜呜! Hey! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, two different materials, red and black, are like two groups of monsters, biting each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug saw this look in amazement, looked down at his hands and found that his hands did not know when it was covered with blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This blood is not someone else, it is his own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger instantly launched the night clock, only to find that his hands did not have any wounds, and the blood did not infiltrate from the pores. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl said at this time: "Don't move."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge sits there at every turn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley quickly pulled the curtains up and prevented the light from continuing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a wave of waving, a group of dark wrapped Su Ge's hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where wrapped in darkness, Suge clearly felt like countless scalloped pythons rubbing on their skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Occasionally, like a cat's tongue, something full of barbs greedily licks on the skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even, Su Ge also felt some sharp teeth, soft and strange suckers, etc...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;He knows exactly what is there, and he knows that his hand still exists because they fully comply with Shirley's will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are those red sticky blood?" Su Ge asked calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley said faintly: "The blood of the ancient gods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
