			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s face is laughing, but what is conveyed is not through sound, but is similar to the magical existence in his consciousness. a message that will be delivered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This message, any existence in the whole world can not be understood, even the March goddess may not understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because this way of communication does not belong here, but belongs to the horrible existence of those who have ruled the stars for countless years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the twinkling of an eye, the hot air came to an abrupt end, as a blown person was violently blocked by the enemy, fierce and decisive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment all normal humans have lost their self-consciousness, and even the recognition of self-form has disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because at this time the eye is the center, the time and space around it have become distorted, and the concept becomes blurred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People can't understand the existence of time and space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even, even the gods of this world cannot understand the gods who master time and space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Different energy continually rushes in the body of Su Ge, the speed of the heart beats constantly, and the amplitude increases rapidly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart at this time is like the heart of a giant, helping Su Ge to run the strange energy that he can't touch and accommodate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello." A quirky will appeared in Su Ge's mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This voice is so clear, so clear, not the fragments left over from ancient times, but the existence of a dialogue with him now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello." Su Ge responded politely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The endless gray fog gradually dispersed, and Su Ge suddenly found himself in a huge space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This unprecedented four weeks is boundless darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this darkness is not absolute, and countless stars that shine with light flash in the darkness, just like the hope of glory in the desperate dark world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗖嗖嗖...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light of those stars when Su Ge did not react Gradually erupted, forming a strip of silver-white light links to each other, Su Ge faintly felt this huge method he could not understand, even unimaginable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These bands seem to have been completed in an instant, and the entire dark world has a little light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咕噜......咕噜......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light and darkness, it’s like boiling water The bubble bursts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next blink of an eye, there are four doors in front of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four doors are arranged in the longitudinal direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless classical sacred lines on the door. He can see the lines of the two doors in a vague way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leftmost line has this myriad of frosts, battleships, undead, wolves, and some great presence on the waves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time the door has been opened, and a strange array of things is constantly emanating, linking his will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The center of the rightmost door is a dark clock, surrounded by bloody seas, dead people, and the sacred fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This door has opened a gap slightly, and the blue mist formed a myriad of wires that connect the Suge to the threshold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two doors in the middle that he couldn’t see clearly closed tightly and seemed to have no connection with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he clearly felt that the will was just from one of the two doors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge did not act rashly, quietly standing still in place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oops...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the second door on the left slowly opened a gap . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this door opening open, countless strange gray rays overflow from the gap and are scattered throughout the starry sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s heart doesn’t know why it’s a bit exciting, it seems to be a lottery ticket, waiting for the lottery to win the lottery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is eager for the truth, and has great interest in all the secrets revealed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this door is not fully open, just opening a corner gap. The last remaining door still has no meaning to open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Su Ge’s eyes fell on the door that opened slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the leak of countless rays, Su Ge felt that his sight and will were polluted and assimilated, and everything was to be grayed out. Drowning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the crucial moment, Su Ge seems to suddenly think of something, whispered: "You are Yugo Sotos?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eccentric scene in front of you, let Su Ge think of the god of time and space and space through the memory of the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hides behind each door and is called a monster hiding in the doorway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His body is made up of billions of bubbles that emit light, which may be blue or strangely gray. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is called the return of all things, all the doors of his infinite body link, if people find the right door, they have a chance to see this god And get knowledge beyond ordinary people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yug Sotos is also among all the gods, and very few are not hostile to human beings and are relatively close to each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything that he has experienced, and today's situation, after the association of the shackles, Su Ge suddenly thought of the possibility of this door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knowledge that does not belong to this world maintains the Su Ge will and protects his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door seems to open a little more, and then a paw consisting of countless weird bones and an indescribable membrane slowly sticks out from behind the door. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This paw is so familiar, Su Ge lost his voice: "Luobo!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This The body of the claw and the Suger mount, the look of the Tindaros hound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the claws continued to extend, Su Ge found it wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lobo's body is slender, but this body presents a strange spiral, and it seems to have countless claws and tentacles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Su Ge even saw that it had nine heads that extended from behind the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the race is the same, it is not Lobo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nine heads, countless eyes looking at Su Ge, the will once again appeared directly in Su Ge’s mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that you have figured out a lot."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge direct view this only exposed The head and the front paws, like the monsters lying in front of the door, said: "The clues are very fragmented, but when they come here, it is time to connect them together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "You brought me here, do you want me to be that heart?" Su Ge asked directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This monster looks at Su Ge, there is no volatility in the will: "You can understand this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then, isn't you Yugo Sotos? What kind of connection do you have with me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How much is the cause and effect, but Su Ge Still do not know what special things he has, so that he is qualified to stand here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monster responded: "No. As for you, you have been thinking about why you came here because of what is special. This is actually very simple."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The will of the monster pauses "When you exist, you are already special, and you are qualified to stand here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Earth has hundreds of millions of people, even Cthulhu Knowledge is small, there are still countless people who are more proficient in this aspect than me." Su Ge said seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are no identical leaves in the world, and naturally there are no exactly the same people. Others certainly have more proficient knowledge, but they are not you." Did not answer Su Ge's inner doubts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Su Ge knew that he couldn’t ask anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Bring my will here, why?" Sug changed direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nine heads of the monster are lifted up at the same time: "Just declare the boundaries of the site and drive away the invaders."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Just because of this?" Su Ge is incredible about this motive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monster will still be dull: "That's it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug is somewhat speechless:" So why am I here?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Your body and knowledge cannot withstand such energy has come to the brink of destruction, your physical protection measures make you fall into Sleeping, the door of the heart is temporarily open, you can naturally walk into the world of this door along the door."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ice Heart is the link here?" Su Ge a glimpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't link here, it's in the link door."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug has some catch Mad, because the monster said that it is too sturdy, people can be irritated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are too messy and too complicated." The monster suddenly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you mean?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To complete a more advanced evolution, you must have a purely pure form. What you have mastered is too complicated, this knowledge, All this needs to be normalized and brought back into this door."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge frowned and seriously thought about the meaning of this sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time doesn't know how long it has been in the past, Su Ge's temptation asks: "Bell, death power, cold flame, vibration knowledge, fog power, dream power. You mean The things I have mastered are too complicated, which is not conducive to my development, so I need to put this knowledge together?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monster head nods slightly: "meaning The same, the mood is different. Normalization and induction are very different."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How do I get one?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"You are already on the way to reunification."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"???" This is a saying that Su Ge has a black question mark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unable to wait for Su Ge to ask again, Su Ge felt that the starry sky curled up to a minimum in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All time, all the space disappeared instantly and lost its meaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, he feels that he is crossing quickly, and seems to be coming to a far-reaching place in the depths of the stars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it has passed, he crossed countless lights and saw a strange calm lake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in amber, there is an indescribable, horrible eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;唰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this eye, Su Ge’s spirit began to tremble, an emotion that did not know whether it was fear or excitement and swelled in his will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug is very clear who the eye belongs to. But at this time he did not have the slightest fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he feels that he is now on the same level as this one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he turned his eyes and looked at it, and he found himself turning into a huge, indescribable gray eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This pair of eyes, calling it a planet is not an exaggeration! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what Su Ge discovered. It is not himself who is really looking at this eye, but the one who controls his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, he is just a passer-by, or a student who follows the teacher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he is not the protagonist, he has launched everything to record this unimaginable process. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This experience, he feels that there will be no second time in this life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two eyes, across countless stars, countless hours of confrontation, seem to have gone through a very long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s so long that Sog feels that he is going to die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It also seems to be only for a moment, and the short-term effort is over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concept of time has become so blurry in this eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the eccentric gaze of Su Ge, the indescribable eyes in the lake gradually closed and finally sank into the lake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is not sure what this is because of this, and I don’t know who won this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge gray eyes collapsed instantly, and Su Ge felt that the space began to be infinitely stretched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French, Father Sini is full of blood and tears looking forward . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nine Huangpao people and countless Yi people who were there before have disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the existence of a horror that has shrouded in the sky has disappeared, and I don’t know where to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug stood there motionless, and the eyes covered by gray looked at the ground dull, as if stupid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything has returned to calm, if not the square that was completely dissolved, even just everything seems to be a dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The church members have returned to God in succession, they did not feel, because they have just lost their self and entered the unconscious chaos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French Sini wiped the blood and tears on his face, and stood up hard, watching the already calm sky: "Tonight, I have temporarily escaped." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray light finally dissipated in Su Ge’s eyes, and his consciousness returned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after the return, Su Ge’s face was extremely weird. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body is still the body, there is no obvious change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he felt that the ice heart on his chest seemed to be a bit huge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open the collar and look down, the big ice heart has once again broke through the chest of Sug, the ice blue surface reveals a small part. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this is not the most critical, the most crucial thing is that Su Ge feels that the body is empty at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His psionics, his knowledge, his powers, all his mysteries have disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t panic because he had felt before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strange energy flowing out of the heart is raging in his body, not only smashing his psionic power supply system, but also smashing his mysterious knowledge system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even, the holy mark of the lake is no longer in his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
