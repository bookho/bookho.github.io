			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A living room on the second floor, Su Ge and Mill are sitting opposite each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just experiencing the horrible thing, Su Ge is still calm, like a person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The so-called soldiers and detectives are unreliable. This small-scale werewolf plague is just a test of the madman. I can’t leave because I want to protect my majesty. The Royal Palace, I will hand it over to you this time." Mil said with a touch of coffee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Su Ge, Mill has enough new people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not how good the relationship between the two is, but the deterrent of the potion is enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This experiment, the show is on the one hand, more threats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge naturally understands the truth - if you dare to play tricks, I will make you worse than him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; solemnly nodded and immediately asked: "For the situation in the city, I have to understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "The situation in the city looks complicated, but a closer look will tell you that it is actually very simple."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mier put down the cup and said casually:" The Duke of the Mountain Range has a great ambition. He not only wants the entire Guinness Kingdom, but also conquers other countries around him. Therefore, he also cooperates with the Institute of Polar Studies and the Death Sect."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Another colleague of Raul collaborates with Prince Saku, the organization behind them is the Twin Alliance. The kingdom of Sacco, the kingdom of the high wind itself is a believer in the black blood."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The other force is the Longyan believers from the North Wind continent. They secretly support the Marquis of Seth, but their purpose is relatively simple. They want the flame stone veins that the royal family has mastered." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The rest of the organization is not climate, light Church and Mission wizard called although very loud, but the base camp is too far from here, threatening not great "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;When Su Ge heard it, he decided to divide the general forces in the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The war on the surface of the capital is now over. It is not good for everyone to continue playing. Now the real war is secret, who can win more With the support of many nobles, whoever can master the absolute initiative.” Mill’s analysis is very thorough, and it is clear that the complex situation that Elena can’t understand is clear in a few words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After he quickly digested the information, Su Ge nodded and said, "Well, I understand it. I need to investigate this plague problem." "Right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I will score according to your completion and speak to your majesty, and let those ministers shut up."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of shutting up, mil’s face finally appeared to be the cold and indifferent to the demon hunter,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Seeing it, he hates those ministers very much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug took the cane and stood up: "Others can do it myself, I need you to send me quietly out of the palace."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is simple!" Mil smiled and stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10 am, Su Ge wearing a black suit, head Wearing a polished black silk hat, holding a cane in his left hand, standing in a ruin in the north of the outer city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just, the people of Mir sent him to the plague of the incident, and through his official status, he got a certain authority in the army and entered the scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The place where the plague broke out was an opera house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the outbreak of the war, it was occupied by a group of hooligans and became their nest, with a total of thirty-four people living. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last night, the plague broke out suddenly, and thirty-one of the thirty-four people became sly werewolves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining three poor worms were shredded by other werewolves. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The patrolling soldiers found the werewolf to quickly encircle and pursue, and the opera was burned directly by the soldiers with a fire for insurance and safety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The root plague can also burn the residual plague virus through the flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame of the opera was extinguished in the morning, and now it is still a black smoke, full of burnt ruins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug stood on the edge, and the cane randomly opened some black rubble and saw a completely burnt hand underneath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This fire is really good, all traces and clues are burned out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Thinking in my heart, Su Ge’s eyes turned around and saw a lot of people who were similar to their own costumes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people are representatives and detectives sent by various nobles to help the army find an excuse to find relevant clues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, some people want to destroy the trails left behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, two people who represent the Duke of the Mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at these two people, Suge’s mouth reveals a little bit of a sinister smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he saw an acquaintance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two men are middle-aged people who are on the sidelines, and another middle-aged man with a gloomy face and glasses is actually the beginning of Su Ge’s occult Teacher, the Necromancer who killed him: John Rose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This world is really small!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the changes in Suge over the past few months Big, when John looked around, he spoke two or three times on Su Ge, and he did not recognize this former student. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Su Ge did not intend to greet him greeted, he came here to investigate things, not to scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After determining that there is no clue here, Suge closes his eyes and releases his psionic power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the unique knowledge of the sacred officer, Suge clearly perceives the three souls wandering aimlessly on the ruins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This should be the three ordinary people killed by the werewolves."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge Silently recited the prayer vocabulary of the priest, accompanied by the fine microwave movement of the psionic power, felt the three souls attracted by the warmth and quickly approached the Su Ge side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the three souls were tolerated by gentle psionics, Sug turned and left quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I need a safe place." Su Ge found a one-eyed soldier who was familiar with Elena before: Old Green. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green did not make it difficult for Su Ge, and nodded slightly to let him enter their temporary tent here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a very ordinary sleeping tent. Now the soldiers are out, no one is empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge sat down and closed his eyes and gradually recited the words of prayer and comforted the three souls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the time is ripe, Su Ge’s voice softly asks: “What's wrong with you, my child.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the three souls instinctively regard Su Ge as their closest person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the souls said: "Big brother, the crazy guys caught us, and after we tied us, we were going to give us medicine."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mom, they are crazy, they want to turn us into bloodthirsty monsters, I am so scared!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dad, it’s terrible! The group of guys not only turned them into monsters, but after they became monsters, they also used needles to puncture the back and draw a lot of blood. I am so scared, I don’t want to be a monster. I don't want to be drawn."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge first wrote down the messages and asked: "Where did they come from? How many people? They are all long What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
