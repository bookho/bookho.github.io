			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looked at a messy basement and the rotten flesh around it, losing its mysterious effect. The carrion gradually changed back to its original form. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug saw his fingers, saw his arm, saw the skin, and saw the various organs and tissues of the human body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vomiting and vomiting......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a time, Su Ge had a severe nausea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three nightwatchers have long been accustomed to it, at this time they are searching for important remnants in the inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Su Ge was ready to follow the past, there was a sudden whisper in his ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good hate! Why did he kill my child? What happened to my child? Damn Elijah..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this sound Su Ge is quiet, through the control of the sound, he knows that this is the residual echo that some souls are about to dissipate here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The nature of the corpse is similar to that of the grievances. It is an evil thought body formed by a myriad of hateful emotions. It is only the form of the two. "#br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This voice should be the pregnant woman who died, and the child should be the corpse. As for Elijah, he should be pregnant. Kill and make the baby the culprit of this look."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There should be a lot of dead people here, now the mystery has not completely dissipated, there should be some Other residual echoes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Su Ge closed his eyes and gathered the spirits to form a virtual clock in his mind, simulating the battleship. The big bell emits a similar ripple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A heavy, thick voice is emanate through the psionic energy, forming numerous ripples that spread out around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey? Have you heard the bell?" Bobby, who was looking for something, moved and suddenly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marx nodded slightly and said, "I want to hear it, but it is too illusory, and illusory"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The front of Rogan turned his head and glanced at Su Ge, faintly said: "Don't think too much, look for it seriously."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This side As the bell spreads, Su Ge searches through his own methods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The desire to seek a quiet and lost soul, listen to the guidance of the sound of the late bell, obey your own instinct, gather it. Incorporate into this night, rely on Under the endless wings of my Lord, I am redeemed and peaceful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking with the bells coming out less than three seconds, Su Ge felt The five broken souls do not know where to appear, and quickly come together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consciousness of these people has long been completely obscured, and everything follows the instinct, leaving only a few words, or a few words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't eat me! Don't eat me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is blood in the coffee...flavor It’s really good.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“There is a good meal in that restaurant...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am so hungry, is there anything to eat?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What kind of meat is this burger, it is delicious."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five remnants of the soul, the five paragraphs before and after the end of the words do not want to close. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but at the same time point to an event: eat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge opened his eyes: "These five people all have special hobbies for eating, that is, killing them and throwing their bodies here. People are tempted by eating, coffee shop... human blood... really is related to ghouls."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Suge meditates, Marx laughs Asked: "What? But come see?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge immediately shook his head: "I am not ready yet, next time!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scene is really disgusting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marx does not insist, the topic of conversion asks: "How did you feel about this battle?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Su Ge recalled a series of operations by just three people, and answered seriously: "Cautious and careful, step by step."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ingenuity!" Marx erected thumb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In place!" Bobby looked up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogan turned to look at Sugna’s pale face and his wriggling throat, laughing and saying: “If you don’t participate in the aftermath, don’t be sinned here. Your mission is over and you can go home now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this Su Ge without any refusal, I thanked and turned and rushed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha!" Looking at the back of Su Ge's wolf, Marx laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sitting on the coach of the church, Sug leaned back in the chair thinking about the battle and his performance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The method of confronting these things is effective, but it is not the most effective way." Su Ge looked down at the sword in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle just made him feel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can I think of Mr. Rogan’s invisible attack directly through mystery? For example, through my late bells."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have a good mysterious cut through the phonic blade formed by the psionics, and this good insight. Oh, today's series of actions are too particular about me. The identity of the priest, the exercise on the sound has not been upgraded at all. It should be noted that the card that really protects and strengthens the combat power is the power of this voice, and it must be exercised as soon as possible."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is ten days, and Su Ge did not practice on the sound. After all, he lacks too many things and needs to lay the foundation first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At the end of this time, I will look for some mysterious books related to sounds... Wait, I don't have a book in my hand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly Su Ge thought of the "night clock of the valley" in his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At the time, the ability to withstand is not good. Now, it should be time to start exploring the secrets in this book."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Su Ge meditated, he suddenly heard a slight gasp in his ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gasping is very weird, as if there is a slap in the scorpion, which makes people very uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this sound, Sugerton was extremely vigilant and nervous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because this quirky voice is the gasp of a small ghoul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the sound came, Su Ge felt a shadow over his own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I still want to engage me?" Su Ge eyes a glimpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sugg, who has had an experience, responds instantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was again a ring of psionics in my mind, and thick ripples spread. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While spreading, Su Ge began to mix the ripples of the bell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The sharp edge!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice fell, the thick ripples instantly stirred up and became Countless psionic blades with horrible cutting power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A burst of harshness, like the sound of a glass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Invisible shadows directly shatter and dissipate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The effect is good!" Su Ge nodded with satisfaction, turned his head through the window, just saw a black suit in the dark lights of the street corner. People. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
