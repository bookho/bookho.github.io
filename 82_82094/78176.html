			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When two people just got off the bus, they saw that the big pier was surrounded by three floors and three floors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get out! Let go! Police!" Jack took out his badge and shouted loudly with his rough voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people in front of them heard a very comfortable way to let a road open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug went down the road, and most of the people on both sides were the workers who were loading and unloading here, as well as the sailors who were temporarily resting on the shore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"French Saugus, please help those poor souls to return to the arms of the March goddess." In the crowd, a woman wearing plain clothes has tears in her eyes. Whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded with a heavy nod and said: "Please rest assured, kind lady, goddess will not abandon her people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the crowd, Jack whispered as he crossed the line: "Don't say, your temperament is indeed more like a kind priest than a mysterious god. Detective."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, every day with the church scriptures, plus the transformation of the body of the sacred potion to the body gradually deepened, Su Ge face is approachable, The temperament is quiet and gentle, and you can feel a special warmth when you are close. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge took out the "Month of the Moon" from the sect's pocket and said, "It's all its merits."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of the conversation, Roland had come over and handed two people with two gray facial masks and said to Su Ge: "A little psychological preparation, Master Geros is waiting for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded with a mask and went up the steps to the loaded wooden platform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This platform is very wide and is a professional platform for loading and unloading goods for some large cargo ships. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time there are still a lot of khaki sacks and wood boxes, which should be loaded with goods on board. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least 30 police officers on the platform were patrolling in a vigilant manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, Su Ge once again saw other mysterious organizations of the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a group of black and white robe nuns, wearing tight leather armor outside the robe, wearing a nun on the head and wearing a gray mask on the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are fully armed, with silver-gray goddess badges on their chests, some with big swords, some with heavy-duty gear rifles that spray steam, and some Hand-held double knives, all kinds of colors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although they are very different, they all give people an indescribable feeling of excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although I have seen it a few times, every time I see it, it gives people an indescribable surprise." Su Ge sighed in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time it was too big. Before the martial law, only four exorcism nuns were dispatched. This time, a whole team of seven people came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time they kept a certain distance from each other and watched the situation around them with vigilance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going forward is the ghost ship that docked in the lock. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a large ocean-going sailing vessel with a hull of at least 60 meters long and a black and solid iron lining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now the ship does not see the sails, only the solitary masts and the messy ship's side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sailing boat is not worn out, and is completely different from the dilapidated ghost ship seen in the movie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the deck of the bridge deck, not to wait for Su Ge to look carefully, I saw the whole deck full of bright red blood and strange symbols. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A variety of crew members were cut open by some kind of blood-stained weapon, alive and bleed to death, very cruel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although these bloodstains were frozen because of the low temperature, Su Ge still smelled a bloody smell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge’s stomach began to rush. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forcing the inner discomfort, Su Ge put his eyes on Jerouss standing at the door of the cabin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside Jellos, there are five young and sturdy young men in black robe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five men wear jazz caps made of black leather on their heads, and the close-fitting robes look very high-end, not only with shawls embroidered on their shoulders. There are also gold-like lines similar to lightning on the chest and cuffs. Wearing black and shiny boots under the robe, the whole gives a cold and fierce temperament. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are either armed with long swords, axes, or large-calibre pistols and rifles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the priests of the church gods, each of whom is the elite of battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time they are respectful and discussing what is going on with Gerlos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master Gerlos!" Sug came over and bowed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it is already a mysterious place, Orson, Jack, Roland and others can only watch outside the ship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerlos nodded and said, "You are here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge raised his head, It was not so good to see Jerouss. He had two sly wounds on his face. He seemed to be scratched by something. There was also a bloody and fuzzy wound on his chest. Although he had stopped the blood, it was very scary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a wound on the shoulder, just like being cut by a sharp blade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More prominently, Gerlos was pale at this time, the blood vessels under his skin turned black, and the glare of his eyes sparkled. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the state in which the demon slayer drank the potion, and the dark blood vessels were filled with horrible toxins. But these toxins gave him extraordinary improvement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you okay?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jellos slightly decapitated: "There was a deal of the grievances here, and I suffered a little injury."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a grievance here?" Su Ge looked shocked <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resentment and devil are almost the same, no reason, very frenzied, very aggressive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerlos nodded and said: "There have been six, just solved."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master There are a total of fifty-four dead people here. With this kind of grievance, the souls of three people can be condensed into one soul. Then at least eighteen grievances will be formed. You have just dealt with six, in our current situation, I can’t handle the grievances here, I can only watch these souls become grievances.” Among the five people, the young blondes in their thirties are anxious to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss said faintly: "Father Anthony, don't panic, we have other priests."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Father Anthony turned to look at Su Ge. He didn't know Su Ge. He only knew that he was a novice apprentice who had just become a priest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master! Now the situation is urgent, this kind of apprentice apprentice needs at least half an hour to purify a soul, and his current psionic power can overtake two dead souls at most. Exhausted. At this time, there will be at least six new grievances. I suggest that the ship be completely burned and the body burned with flame water. This is the way to reduce the risk factor to the most stable. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss said faintly: "If it burns, we can't know the secret behind it. So bad things must be checked." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But for the safety of the citizens..." Father Anthony was completely in a hurry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerousus waved his hand: "Even if you sacrifice some people's lives, you can know and grasp the black hands behind the scenes. These costs are also very cost-effective. Sacrifice a few people, In exchange for the happiness of the majority, this has always been the case in the development of history."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Su Ge suddenly flashed a shudder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is so calm to say such violations of human ethics, and only this group of hunters who have no feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
