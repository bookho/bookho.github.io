			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At noon, when Sug and Marlene returned from the suburbs to prepare for dinner, they found a complete form on the ruins of the Basilica of the Holy Blood. Rescue area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surrounding area is surrounded by iron fences and very striking orange-yellow canvases to form a simple wall with a trio of church soldiers patrolling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interior of the wall is rooted in two huge warships. Hundreds of neat tents have been built and divided into several areas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the map of the door, it includes medical areas, accommodation areas, dining areas, material areas, protection areas, and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the huge blank area outside the area, thousands of people gathered at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among these people is a white high platform, standing on a high platform with a woman wearing a light pink robes, a silver hair, and a holy white headdress on her head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This woman looks like she is in her thirties and looks unappealing, but her ethereal, pure atmosphere matches her upper body. And the crystal white skin, the whole gives a very amazing shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This one is called Emilia, known as the pure white sheep, is a schoen-born, and she is rumored to be one of the few in the church. Star Tianting accepted the church members of the goddess of divine baptism," said Marlene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger listened to the horror and then asked: "What is the Star Court?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ma Lynn shook her head slightly: "I don't know exactly what it is, but it is rumored that it is the place where the goddess was recently received. Only the core staff of the church can get there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Su Ge nodded, listening to the ethereal and clear voice: "As the name suggests, it seems that the Archbishop of the church is real."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Of course, Archbishop Emilia is a strong contender for the next pope."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please rest assured, the church will definitely check the cause of this incident. It will definitely give you an account. Please see! The area behind me is the goddess's grace to the people. We will make every effort to ensure that you are assured. The life and property of the people are safe, and after that, the construction of Bain City is more perfect. I believe that after our joint efforts, it will not take long for Bain City to become a first-tier city of the Empire."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emilia's voice is not impassioned, tone and tone are very peaceful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this kind of peace gives a pleasant sound, and people can't help but believe this sentence after listening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Drawing a pie is really the best way to appease people." Su Ge stood outside the crowd and sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is a pie?" Marlene looked awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled: "It is a very illusory and distant future when people are in a difficult situation."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...This is called motivation!" Marlene corrected immediately after listening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately, Marlene immediately said: "You should not underestimate the young archbishop. She has been an archbishop since five years ago and is speaking in public. Five times, I made three promises, and every promise made has been fully fulfilled. In today's twelve central archbishops, the words of Archbishop Emilia are the most trustworthy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge heard a brow and looked at the high school and immediately looked at the archbishop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half an hour, the speech was completed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the large crowd who left, Su Ge could not see the sorrow, pain and despair in their eyes, but was full of excitement and expectation, and the eyes flashed The light of hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We want to be a first-tier city here? I want to buy more houses! I can't afford to buy a city in the city!" Said in the broken pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this kind of broken thoughts is not one or two, but a large group of people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of these people, the city of Bain has become a must-have for the first-tier cities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "True and terrible!" Su Ge was amazed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey? How are you two here? Su Ge, the Archbishop wants to see you and commend you!" Father Harden said from the crowd . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s obvious that watching others accept the award, but Father Harden is not envious and embarrassed at all, but very happy and happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because everyone knows that this time's achievements are not for everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And even if you lead, there is a huge risk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled and said: "Do not worry, give it to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See To the face of Su Ge's self-confidence, Father Harden and Mother Marlene secretly sighed. After the three people quickly entered the rescue area against the flow of people, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the identity of the church, the three people quickly walked to the middle of the rescue zone, a two-story wooden chapel built with movable ironwood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a large amount of troops around the chapel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the ordinary church soldiers with guns, there are six burly warriors wearing silver-white body armor with silver-grey swords behind them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looked at the glorious logo of the holy sword on their chest, and they knew the true identity of this group of people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The elite department of the same sage: the Holy Sword."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chapel entrance Two burly members of the Holy Sword team stopped three people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who!!" asked the black-bearded strong man on the left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father Harden immediately said: "This is Su Ge Sotos, the purple moon substitute in Bain, the person the Archbishop wants to see."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp I heard some accidents from these two fighters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This morning, from the conversation between the Archbishop and the night watchman, the two people have heard the name of this person no less than ten times, I thought it was a very A powerful character, nowadays, is a very ordinary professional priest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He can go in, you two are waiting here!" The status on both sides is far apart, and they don't know each other. The tone of the two guards is very strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony and Marlene were dissatisfied, but they nodded slightly and waited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come on!" The little blonde eye guard on the right yelled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled and went over and asked: "What other questions?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This guard Take a silver crystal fork from behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Injecting his own psionic energy into the fork, picking up the fork and carefully sweeping it over Suger’s body is actually an inspector. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After not finding any information, the big-handed guard’s big hand suddenly slammed on Su Ge’s body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very sudden, suddenly a slap in the Su Ge, almost on the steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"噗嗤!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other warriors and members of the Holy Sword team whispered . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh! Sorry, I have no control." The small-eyed guard said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s face flashed a sullen glance, and then a bright smile said: “Nothing.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The side of Harden and Marlene is very ugly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
