			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug raised his hand and closed Bieber’s eyesless eyes, and solved him from the chair and found that his body was cold and hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A simple check to make sure that Bieber has been dead for at least three days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The child is placed on the ground, and Suge releases his own spirit to feel the soul of Bieber. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And found that his soul has long since disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No redemption, no evil spirits, but it is indeed gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it because of the outside of the circle?" Sug turned and wrapped his sheets around Bieber's body and turned and went out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is still going on, some cold night winds blow, and Pete gradually wakes up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where am I?" Pete looked around nervously and found himself tied to the trunk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Black man!" Pete stunned, his eyes regaining focus around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you awake?" The cold voice came and suddenly made Pete's heart jump. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sound is cold and scary, and the words that spit out exude a hail like a hail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A stiff turn around, Pete saw the black man staring at himself at this time, a pair of blue-fired eyes filled with oppressive majesty and cold . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You...who are you? Who knows where the territory is?" Pete’s heart was fearful, but his mouth was very tough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge walked over and said faintly: "This is the land of Guinness, not the territory of anyone, Mr. Lit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know me!?" Pete stunned after listening to his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge took off the mask and opened his mouth to reveal some horrible smiles. "Remember me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pitt stared at Su Ge first was thinking Then, his face gradually paled and he gritted his teeth: "Sug Sotos! Who the hell are you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug did not answer, lifted his cane, at Pete's gaze gradually turned into a sharp sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is... mysterious costume?" Seeing the deformed cane, Pete’s heart flashed a sizzle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has been in the death sect for more than a decade, and does not have a mysterious costume. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I heard John say that you are dead, but I didn't expect to survive." Pete whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled even more and said: "If I don't live, who do you think told the police, and then I am going to sweep you up?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing this Pitt spirit shocked, then the eyes were full of grievances, staring at Su Ge whispered: "I curse you! The god of death will be your soul Put into the abyss of the wild, let you endure endless suffering forever, and never liberate!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge eyebrows pick: "How can I not know that I still have a block? The territory of the Abyss of Abyss?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you say!?" Pete didn't understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug did not continue to explain, smiled and said: "Okay, the end of the chat is over, let's start a wonderful conversation!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the talking room, the sword in the hands of Su Ge split into a chain sword, and the sharp edges of the sword rubbed against each other, making a harsh friction sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing such awkward weapon, Pete’s forehead suddenly oozes a cold sweat, and he is nervous: "You...you...what do you want? I... tell you This is the hometown of the god of death, killing us, you will endure the endless anger of the god of death!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The hometown of the god of death?" In the heart of the movement, the word is secretly remembered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here Su Ge put the chain sword slowly on his neck, and put it on the side, saying: "Don't move it! Otherwise, this sharp blade will easily cut your aorta."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pitt chin trembles constantly, and the trembling asks: "What do you want to know! I tell you! Don't be impulsive!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point he already wants to understand, Su Ge left himself, certainly must know some information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this Su Ge, I gathered my sword and smiled and said: "This is a child!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "What are you going to call here?" Su Ge asked directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pitt whispered a whisper and said, "We can make soldiers not die in refining..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Under waiting for him to finish, Su Ge held his chin in one hand and said coldly: "My patience is limited, you only have one chance, so you better think about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Su Ge let his body open, pointing to the old man who was also tied to the ground not far away, but still in a coma, said, "I will go back and ask that person if you ask me, if you The two people are different, I will let you see the existence of fear more than death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; patted his face, Su Ge The demeanor said seriously: "Please believe me, I am very honest about this person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咕噜! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pitt swallowed a hard mouth and fell into deep struggle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;铮铮铮... At this moment, the piercing blade crash came again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know? It’s very interesting to have a lot of cutting edges on the human body, and the most interesting thing is that I will open your stomach and will It is put together with your intestines, and then your stomach is stitched."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Su Ge’s smile: "I will take it later. You will also consider doing dozens of sit-ups for a pleasant one-kilometer jog. After all, physical health is the most important thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Pete felt like he was going to collapse, his legs trembled, and the urine stayed down the thighs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You still have five seconds." Sug squats with a sword and a sharp dagger pops up in his left hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't! Don't! I said! I said! I said all!" Pete screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug is sitting on a stone and gesturing to answer the question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pitt hoarsely said: "We are here to summon the breath of the god of death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Speak in detail."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "According to the secrets of our teachings, the book of the Undead, Guinness is the home of the god of death, here is dead The breath of the gods, collecting these breaths allows us to gain more knowledge.” Pete said honestly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly and suddenly asked, "What about the other people in your church?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “The encirclement of Bain City made us lose a lot. After that, we turned into zero, wandering in the northeastern provinces of Guinness and Bellant, and converging the believers while accumulating power. Later, there was civil strife here, and I followed the leader and was Assigned here to carry out the call of breath. The leader brought other people to the capital."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you successful in summoning?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pitt bitterly shook his head: "No, the teacher means that the sacrifice is not enough, and more sacrifices are needed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Are you sure your lord is not lie to you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course not! I have already felt it, because in the recent summoning process, some people feel It’s crazy to go to the weird atmosphere, that is the embodiment of the breath of death, we are only one step away from success!” Speaking of this, Special look of the firm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge did not discuss too much: "Who is the Duke who works with you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
