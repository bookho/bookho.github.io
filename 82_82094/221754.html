			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of the demon hunter entering the battle, Sug turned to the farmer and said, "Go, there is nothing wrong with you here."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The farmer naturally felt the bad atmosphere. After being grateful to Su Ge, he hurriedly turned and fled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug took out the monthly code that he carried with him and watched the imposing hunter: "I am very curious that you dare to cut this sword." Here is the Berant Empire, and the entire city of Bain is sheltered by our Church of the Holy Blood. It is a great gift for you to preach here. If you really regard this as your lion's empire, I don't mind waking you up. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demon hunter can't talk nonsense, mentioning the steel sword body like a ghost, rushed to the front of Su Ge, directly to the chest of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not afraid, but he is very clear about his identity and the purpose of this trip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time he did not intend to kill Su Ge, but only slightly hurt him, declare his strength and attitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This method is very easy to use along the way for two months. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge’s hand-to-hand month’s slogan, the underestimation of pretending. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heavy and distant night bell does not know where it came from. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The powerful steel sword cuts a distance of about one and a half meters in front of Su Ge, as if he had cut an invisible hard cover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗡嗡嗡...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strong vibrations are transmitted from the invisible shield along the steel sword Go to the arm of the demon hunter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a sting and sore spread throughout the arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s expression of calmly raises his hand and points to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snapped! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the moment the ringing sounds, a huge force suddenly spreads around, and the invisible force pushes the demon to step back three steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where, two people, including the knight and the knife axe, couldn’t help but open their eyes, because for a moment they didn’t know it. So what happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In their view, the demon rushed to slam, and as a result, the sword just smashed halfway, just like acting as a step backwards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is the situation?" asked two people at the same time as they walked to the side of the demon hunter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Demon Hunter pinched the sore palm: "Spirit shield, wrong, not an ordinary psionic shield."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cavaliers have some accidents, not only can resist the attack, but also the psionic shield that bounces the enemy. She heard it for the first time. Sug sighed with relief and looked calm like an abyss. It won't be so passive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demon hunter wiped his hand and a bottle of potion had arrived in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want to continue playing?" Su Ge’s incompetent call to his own few psionics, accompanied by the spread of the late bells, countless sound waves The sharp edge is condensed by its side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight and the knife axe suddenly tightened, although they couldn’t see what it was, but the other’s psionics sorted them to give them a sharp thorn. Pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so strange knowledge of sound waves, they also saw it for the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this occupation? Musician? Or singer? Bard?" Three people flashed several sound-related occupations in their minds, but No one can compete with this profession. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s the purple moon activist of the Church of the Holy Blood. This new knowledge is really eye-opening."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as the two sides were arrogant, the sound of easygoing and humming sounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge turned his head and saw that the white-haired missionary who had just preached in the village looked at himself with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This voice is very affable, and both sides are disarmed at the same time, while looking at the missionaries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The missionary is also followed by the village head and the farmer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello, priest." Su Ge converges in a bell, slightly squatting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The missionary was slightly covered, and the kind face was apologetic: "I am sorry, my companion has troubled you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s very courteous salute, followed by a serious tone, righteous words: “It’s the duty of our clergy, but ask your companions to recognize their mission. We are not trying to destroy the monsters in order to kill the monsters. The ultimate purpose of crusade is to let the people of God live a safe and comfortable day. If you want to destroy the monsters, destroy the farmland, and hurt the people, what is the difference between us and the monster?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We rely on the church, the church gives us extraordinary power and qualifications. Then remember your identity, we are the public servants who serve the people of the church, It’s not a monster hunter who wants to hunt down the monsters!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last words are upright and powerful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These words are very powerful and very exciting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The village head and the farmer on the side heard the excitement and the whole body trembled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many years, this cleric’s remarks really talked about the hearts of two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged missionary’s kind eye has flashed some accidents, and some of them are surprised to say these words from the mouths of young people like Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the knight wearing a heavy armor heard this, a pair of blue eyes under the armor flashed an inexpressible excitement, then took off the helmet As soon as I saw my long blue hair, my beautiful face was revealed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is your name?" asked the knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is not cold and bleak: "When you ask someone else's name, you must at least report your name first."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cavaliers did not care about Su Ge’s attitude and said directly: “Remember my name, Vegginia Fern.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Suge then reported his name: "Sug Sotos."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After exchanging the name, Su Ge said to the missionary: "This priest, since you are a missionary from afar, there must be some means. But..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, Su Ge’s tone is somewhat yin and yang of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In order to get rid of the water ghosts, is this means of using explosives to blast the drains? Is it too inconspicuous? If you don't have any other means, then please You can stop here!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, the demon hunter has no feeling, the horsewoman and the knife axe suddenly feel a little hang on the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The missionary also looked awkward and hurriedly apologized: "I am sorry, Sotos is a substitute, we have a lot of mysterious materials along the way, they make decisions like this." It may be to save some mysterious materials."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the conversation, the missionary turned to look at the three humanities: "Fern, hurry to treat this nest of ghosts Off, use the least destructive means. Mr. the village chief has fulfilled the agreement with us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The missionary's words are very useful, three people randomly gave up the explosives Open the drain, but take out a potion and pour it into the water to attract the ghost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The water ghosts that are led out are naturally facing the endless anger of these three who have just been angry with Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under Su Ge’s gaze, the three people easily hacked all five water ghosts with ease and ease. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The real strength of these three guys is at least expert level." Su Ge estimated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
