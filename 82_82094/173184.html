			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inside of the door was dark, and Su Ge did not rush in. He reached out and touched the door, opened the gas lamp inside, and looked at the situation carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing special about it, it is a relatively small triangular room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The empty room with ice-blue walls gives the impression of an ice-cold lab. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a black iron door on each wall, as Roland said, the left door is the largest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three walls, it’s a weird structure." Su Ge said, turning around and locking the air pump door behind him with a lock to prevent it from happening. Suddenly locked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing five "Death is coming" and many ghost films, Su Ge attaches great importance to this escape door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After everything was determined to be no problem, Su Ge strode to the front of the morgue, and when he was about to open the door, Su Ge suddenly stopped to prevent the accident. Once again, I launched my inspiration and tested if there were any threats inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this time, after opening the inspiration, Sugton felt the hair blasting, and the whole skin seemed to be squirmed by countless bugs, feeling terrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, Sug’s eyes widened and then stepped back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪嗒! Hey! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suger suddenly heard a sound like a piece of carrion constantly hitting the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oops...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the door locked by the lock seems to be a huge force Like the push, the squeak of the steel lock is squeaky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪叽! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fist-sized piece of meat was squeezed out of the doorway of the morgue, and then a baby’s eyeball appeared in the pile of carrion, a bloodshot eyeball Staring at Su Ge with an unspeakable horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge said nothing, the body immediately rushed forward, breaking through the room at the limit speed of Su Ge's weekdays. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"嗷呜斯嘎!" The squeaky inaudible sound came out from inside, the steel lock at the door was broken instantly, and the entire pump door suddenly closed. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗖! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, Su Ge is fast enough. When he is about to close, his body will rush out like a sharp arrow, then he will roll on the ground with his body. The oil rushed out along the corridor, rushing, and his face condensed and shouted: "Go! Go! Go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland heard this moment and knew that the situation was wrong. With two bodyguards turned and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! At this time, the door at the door was suddenly closed, and then a piece of carrion was oozing out of the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Close your eyes! Don't look!" Su Ge screamed and uttered all his psionics into his cane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Psychic injection: Injecting psionic energy into materials or weapons with mysterious affinity, forming a dense mysterious structure that can temporarily replace silver blood medicine, but this way The consumption of psionic energy is enormous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calling...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, after the cane was nourished by the psionics, it was instantly renewed, and then There was a chilly wind blowing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few people in Roland felt the shudder of the soul instinct at this time, and shivered intimidation. Obey the instinct to listen to Su Ge's words and close your eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But before that bearded man had some curiosity in his heart, he glanced at the rotten meat that was squeezed out before closing his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, a shrill scream came from his mouth, and then he could see his face suddenly becoming extremely distorted, and the whole person’s skin began. It rots quickly and the hair becomes gray. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Eat you!" The horrible cry came out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the physical corruption, he became extremely horrible and disgusting. He suddenly turned his head and opened his mouth and bite at Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't blink your eyes!" Su Ge's hand in his hand slammed into a long sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body is a healthy step, while the long sword is waving, and the bearded head is cut off in an instant, followed by a turning kick that kicks his strong body. Fly two meters away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While turning around, Sug grabbed Roland and another bodyguard’s clothes and whispered: “Follow my strength!”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, the body took a step forward, and the sword with a cold wind in his hand slammed into the carrion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;唧唧! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weird sound came out of the carrion, and then the hard-rooted carrion suddenly shrank back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger's body is up, and then his legs and waist are violently exerted, and a powerful mountain hit directly hits the sealed door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge whispered, pulling two people and rushing out quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嘎嘎嘎...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment a shrill call came out of the door, Su Looking back, I saw a group of dead white pieces of meat piled up at the door, gradually forming a scary baby without bones and climbing on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The baby seems to be inseparable from the clinic, and under the gaze of its horrible eyes, the door suddenly shut down and everything returned to normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sogo, how?" Roland listened to the gasping Su Ge, tempted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge took a deep breath and said: "Open your eyes, but don't look at the clinic, go on the bus, go to the Church of the Holy Blood! This thing has been completely noisy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The two have no hesitation and hesitation at this time, the screams of their companions, and the inhuman voice, the taste of weird corruption has made them know that this matter far exceeds their original expectations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, after taking the horse into the car, the scared face of the white bodyguard said nothing, driving the carriage to the fastest speed Blood Church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the afternoon, the interior of the Church of the Moon in the Church of the Holy Blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A white stone built on the table with Makok's sleeping body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three people around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge, Father Anthony, and Rogan wearing a black robe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An hour ago, Su Ge took Roland three people from the relatively small number of the East Gate of the Church of the Holy Blood, and the two were temporarily arranged in the main hall to pray and wait. And Sug took Makok directly to find the Anthony Father who is on duty today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a detailed explanation of the matter, Father Anthony was shocked with a look of disappointment, and then without Suge’s request, he came to Serge with a special purpose as a night watchman. Yuehua chapel resting during the day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lagan three people are sleeping sweet when they come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogan was very alert, and after a few people entered, he quietly woke up and went out to meet Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to the detailed description of Su Ge, Rogan decided to conduct an all-round inspection of Macock’s body to determine the cause of the incident. Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhogan held a silver jug ​​with complex embossed in his left hand, took a sip and closed his eyes for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The side of Su Ge clearly felt that after a strong psionic flash, Rogan squirted the wine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
