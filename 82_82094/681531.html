			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ps: About Pangu is not forcibly renewed and written, before there is a foundation. The details are in this chapter, and then sprayed after reading. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The information that Guju said, the impact on Su Ge is subversive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He heard about the cloud paradise from Bart’s mouth at an early age (see Chapter 0106: Secrets two years ago). Something related to the East, but what he did not think is that the so-called East actually involves so many secrets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And from the mouth of Gujue, Su Ge can feel that his hometown and what he knows is not a place, he can even say that the earth is A completely different place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The whole thing has become more and more strange." At this moment, Su Ge suddenly felt that his crossing involved a lot of conspiracy he could not imagine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why should I be selected? Why can I come to this world? The earth must have a special relationship with this weird place." Su Ge suddenly thought Yugo Sotos, who has been hiding behind, and whose name is only one word away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Lord of Time and Space, the key to the door, the monster hiding in the door. Yugo Sotos claims to be everywhere, can hide in the world At the back of the door, you can also connect any two doors in the world to complete the crossing of time and space. If this is the case, is it that Yugo Sotos connects the two worlds together and realizes my Crossing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And my arrival is likely to be a backhand of Yugo Sotos, or a helping hand. For the past two years, Countless people have mentioned that the world has been swallowed up by despair and there is no hope of redemption. Before entering the old dreams of the ancient city for the first time, the ancient gods also said that they need outsiders to break."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you say that I am the one who broke this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a time, Su Ge recalled many things in the past and many of the things he encountered. event. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shaking his head, Su Ge jokingly said: "If this can be written as a book, I should be the protagonist."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the following time, Su Ge did not go away, but went straight to sleep, and wanted to analyze the massive information that he knows today through the body of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sitting on the throne, Su Ge started his body and quickly analyzed it from the dream encounter of last night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The world is a dream left by a god, a substantial knowledge is condensed. The three giant monsters in the sky should be the goddess of March As for the ancient gods saying that they were trapped there, it should be the hands and feet of the March goddess. The seven ancient gods, as the seven origins of the world, are immortal according to common sense. But since the ancient god’s body has lost its activity. , that means the spirit of their people has been imprisoned."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The world is very broken, there are many bodies. From their costumes, it seems to have been fighting That is to say, the world is eroding their remaining will, and they have less time. They are always looking for ways to escape, and reincarnation through the child should be one of them."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The second point, the seven ancient gods knew me, and said that I also lost a lot, saying that "I" knew before. On the other hand, they called me "the world." The title is a bit interesting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;& "The world contains seven principles of origin, and the world contains time and space. They seem to be happy to give me the Holy Grail. Then there is no doubt that I am the one who has been waiting for the break."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The old Weiss, for the time being, he should have some cause and effect for my incarnation for some reason, so I have been watching my incarnation."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The world...Sheryl should have some answers I want." Su Ge has found his way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" As for the dream that the worm said, Cthulhu was sending a message to the woman through his Dai, and Hasta was coming in some way. And it just happened to be in this capital city. According to the authenticity and intensity, the advent is estimated to be in these days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it comes, it should be There will be a good show. It is just a matter of touching the details of the church today."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The last is what this is called by Gu Jue."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is telling the truth and not lying. But this Pangu is indeed a bit awkward."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to the existing worldview. The world's most primitive time It is the world of the seven ancient gods. After the goddess appeared in March, the seven ancient gods were suppressed. At the same time, for some reason, the goddess fell into a deep sleep."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The time node is that the undead has opened up the world and formed a civilization."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The undead is shattered, the world resurrected after the first night. Byron The Great Emperor touched the Holy Grail of the Soul and opened up the original mysterious system of mankind. After the Byron dynasty was destroyed, it was probably the cold dynasty dynasty that the ghouls said. The cold king opened up a new contact through the temperature holy grail, which is the holy grail. "The system."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There should be other dynasties, and the last time has gone through tens of thousands of years, to the world of technology in the Stars Travel. And then because of Sulu’s awakening, the world is in a second night.” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After the second night, Kabatos College revived the mysterious system, and many cults revived. Three students holding the Holy Grail, split and established three The church, the present March church, is followed by the famous four mystical dynasties."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The First Dynasty, Luwen Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second Dynasty, Sossia Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third dynasty, the Kardin Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth dynasty, the Doraline Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After that, I came to the present era."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The timeline of the whole world After using God's thinking to smooth down, Su Ge touched his chin: "Although the timeline is very long, but the calculation is detailed, it is still very compact. There is no such thing as the Pangu Giants in the whole process, and there is no relevant record in the world. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it true that Pangu is a fictional one? Oh, of course not."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;Thinking of this, Su Ge's burning wildfire eyes shimmered like deep abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If there is no guess, this Pangu is also a traverser, or a traversal of God. He should be similar to hunter, is Yuge · Sotos came from a certain world!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yug Sotos seems to be planning a huge plan. But from the current situation Look, the previous one, or several attempts failed. Like the uprising of the uprising, and the result is the end of the gods, Yugo Sotos is missing, and the gauze Nicholas he planned with him becomes what it is today. Memory is incomplete. Hunting and dying, leaving only the flesh and the broken battleship, the ancient gods died, even including the bell, the god of death, etc."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Fighting is the last planned break. After his failure, he fell into a state of death and hid in the gap between the spaces."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If there is no guess If it is wrong, Pangu is probably the first time that Yugo Sotos plans to invite the outsiders from the outside world. And the final defeat failed, and died directly. The Pangu giant also did a hiding function similar to wild hunting. Unlike the stalking of the hunter, He chose to take his servant, or the people hiding in the world. Inside."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Guzhi said that there is no polluted world, the hope of world salvation. It is probably the legend left in ancient books. The person who left the legend is not the Pangu who failed, but the defeated Yugo Sotos. There should be a key to the breach."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking Back, Su Ge looked down at the silver-gray hand armor and said faintly: "If this is the case, then I am the third breakter that Yugo Sotos brought. This time is different from the previous one, the first two The times are the supreme gods in the two mythological systems. This time I chose an ordinary person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, it turned out to be like this."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg thought about sitting up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this the possibility of believing in humanity?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The two that came before The gods should be limited by the divine minds, and all their actions are clearly understood by a certain existence, that is, all possibilities are sealed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But people and God are not a kind of existence. Human thoughts are dirty, meaningless, and ridiculous in the eyes of God. At the same time, the messy thoughts are not understandable by the gods."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So I want to use this method to let Su Ge take the mortal body, master the hunter, the seven holy cups, and even the heritage of Pangu. After that, humanity and humanity The possibility of breaking?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Su Ge looked up at the bell above his head: "From this point of view, it seems that those gods who have passed away recognize this. The plan, even the seven ancient gods who were imprisoned, recognized it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's a bit interesting." Su Ge smiled in a rare form. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If this is the case, is my current thinking mode and posture somewhat self-contained?" Su Ge thought of it at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Su Ge’s rare body did not despise the mortal body, but began to look up from the depths of the heart, or to understand the human form. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time, Su Ge sighed a little helplessly: "It seems that it still takes some time, it is like letting me into the thinking of a pig, some difficulties "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Temporarily put this extremely difficult problem down, and Su Ge once again sorted out all the information he had known in the past few days from beginning to end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Church of the Holy Blood is finding me in some way, and they must have a battle, it should be in these two days."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gujue has always emphasized that Shirley is Ada, this is more interesting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge suddenly thought of the ancient sense adhere to. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The eyes of the gods can't see the body of Shirley, and can't be analyzed. But this doesn't matter. Whether it's Shirley or Ada, I I like it." Sug showed me a look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After thinking about everything, Su Ge summoned Vanas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
