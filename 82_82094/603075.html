			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is fast, at least faster than the shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not clear what he is, but what he knows is that this kind of thing that comes through prayer is definitely not something he can contend with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There has not been completely established." Su Ge thought that a lot of vibration was released from his feet, and the body instantly rushed to the side of Mary, holding her hand. Pull it out from the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; was slammed up, and Mary opened her eyes in shock and was ready to sneer at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug only took a blindfold covering his eyes. Now, at a close look, Mary recognizes who this person is at a glance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Assassin, what's wrong?" Mary asked softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s face said solemnly: “Have you just held a ceremony? Have you made some kind of prayers?”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Sugg’s dignified look, Mary’s heart tightened and hurriedly nodded: “Yes, we just played a game, not a cult ceremony.”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She just finished, suddenly a very harsh sound came from not far from her front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scream of this sound suddenly caught everyone’s attention, including Mary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the gaze of the people, the young man who had just led the prayer was constantly twisted all over the body, and then the muscles under the skin began to swell and squirm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;噗嗤...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A burst of blood and intestines spewed out of his body, in the blink of an eye, The person who was just normal turned into a monster with blood and muscles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, ah, ah! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After two seconds of silence, countless harsh screams came from the woman's mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Monster! Monster!" With a burst of fear, everyone in the hall panicked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, hundreds of people were scared and caught in a complete panic, pushing each other, pulling each other and stepping on each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noisy, screaming, running, cursing sounds throughout the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary is completely scared at this time, physically weak on the floor, and the whole body is constantly shaking: "This...this is..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In her stagnation, the screams sounded from the voices of others, and then they were struggling and trembling, or spit out blood, or the whole body. The flesh broke, or the head was misplaced...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary’s eyes gradually widened, and her spiritual vision has grown by four. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the crucial moment, a powerful big hand caught her eyes, and the vision that she had begun to skyrocket gradually stabilized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I...I..." Because of the skyrocketing spirit, Mary trembled, not only unable to say anything, but even the whole body was soft, completely unable to work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time she feels that she has been overwhelmed by fear, and she is so weak, her brain is blank, like a memory, everything is sensible. All disappeared in general. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, calm down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as she is about to be overwhelmed by that fear When I fell into deep despair, an unspeakable voice did not know where it came from. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sound has an indescribable magical power, like the morning sun after the night, like the prayer of a kindly priest, like the comfort of a father, like the voice of the soul of the town ......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this voice, she gradually asked for fear. Of course, when she returned to God, she found that she was all sweated through her body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowly raised his head and saw Su Ge's face with a mask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Recovering reason?" The good voice that redeemed her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, she feels what is the real hero, what is the true romance. She was caught in a wonderful state. There was only one face of Su Ge in the whole world. The voices of the whole world were only the calm, soft and nice voice of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wants to abandon all her intellect and stand up and want to hug her hero. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But at the moment she was ready to get up, she felt instinctively dangerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slightly sideways, she saw a very sexy and seductive figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She knows that this is her hero’s fiancee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah ah ah...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wonderful feeling disappeared and I heard it in my ear Others screamed in horror, shouting, cursing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Isn't I still recovering consciousness?" Su Ge was surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary hurriedly shook her head and stood up and said seriously: "Thank you, thank you for your help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg heard this secretly sigh of relief: "Fortunately, the will has not been affected, I still need you to help me into the aristocratic circle of the Imperial City."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Assassin!" At this moment, Albert rushed over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly and turned to look at the dozens of monsters chasing other people not far away, saying: "It should be blessed, but ignored a lot." The steps, even treating ordinary food as a sacrifice, were countered."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Blessing prayer?" Mary listened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert’s face ugly asks: “What? Do you need to dispose of these monsters?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge looked around and shook his head. "No, these monsters don't cause too much casualties. They are more of a deterrent and squeeze."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Squeeze? Squeeze what?" Albert glimpsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Squeezing people's fears." Su Ge's eyes said, at this time he knows more or less the details of the accused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rumor that she exudes herself seems to exaggerate her strength too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary is now looking at Su Ge’s side face, and he is still stunned. In the face of such a horrible monster, he can remain calm, this mature and steady look It’s so handsome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Look again, I will dig your eyes down, bugs." At this moment, Shirley's cold voice came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Mary’s heart trembled, she was full of fear and bowed her head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Assassin!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a voice coming from afar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug turned his head and saw that Deputy Captain Marchi was waving at himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go! Past." Su Ge hurriedly ran over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Assassin, it’s not good, the captain has been hijacked by the accused accused, the entire cruise has broken down, you are going to save the captain!" The base color said anxiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s eyes stretched out with a trace of irony, then said: “Come on! Captain is the key, absolutely not in his hands!”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, the group quickly left the hall under the leadership of Marchi, following the corridor on the first floor, after passing through several cabins, Marchi took everyone to a cabin door: "From here, here is the near road!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, she took the lead and rushed in. It seemed very anxious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
