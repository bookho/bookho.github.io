			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the left side of the hall, the waiter walked into a corridor with two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When advancing, Su Ge swept around the aftermath of the night clock to confirm the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, Su Ge’s eyes sparkled and he found two important clues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, under the house, about 11 meters from the ground, buried some tramps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of these tramps did not rot, because the blood on the body had been drained and the mysterious traces remained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The sacrifice of blood, it seems that the holder has a relationship with the road family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, he is in the west of the room, blurry perception of a tentacle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tentacle exudes a strong mystery, with a mouthful of mouthpieces on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main thing is that there is a familiar atmosphere on it, that is the breath of his cold flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The messenger of God, the essence of the star. There are two possibilities, the first is the sacrifice of blood. Second, what cursing ceremony they are going to perform "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The bodies have been dead for two or three days from the psionic point of view, which means nothing to do with the curse."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They also want to separate Evan from me..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Su Ge’s face is slightly cold: "You are really Self-seeking dead road."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Advance about twenty meters, the three stopped in front of a gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After knocking on the door, the door opened silently and Su Ge took Evan in and found that there were many people here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two people sitting in front of them, standing on three sides with three strong men. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gas lamps on the roof illuminate the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man sitting on the left has a similarity to Mike. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man on the right has a round face, slightly less hair with a split head, a triangular eye, and a splayed character, giving a very greasy discomfort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan saw this scene, suddenly his face changed slightly, and when he wanted to turn around, he found that the door had been closed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is very calm, carefully looking around, and finally the eyes fell on the bald middle-aged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corner of the mouth is slightly tilted up and whispered: "If you don't have a way to go, then take your life."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Others couldn’t hear it, Evan heard it, and the fist under the sleeve slowly squeezed, taking a deep breath and following Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Welcome! Welcome! A long time, Mr. Sotos’s name, I’ve seen it in the past.” The middle-aged man laughed and stood up and walked over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge smiled slightly: "Mr. Lu’s name has been heard many times since he was a child, and he is known as a tiger philanthropist."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear this, the people present are a bit ugly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Huwei philanthropist is not a derogatory, but a derogatory. The source is that Ligan has repeatedly made charitable donations and has intensified his efforts to return the money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ligen responded instantly, laughing haha: "It’s all folks who pass the rumors, and they are not credible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sit down on both sides, the next person will pour tea on them, and Ligan smiled and said: "A few days ago, my son and your friends had some misunderstandings between them, and I hope that Bishop Sotos would not care." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge leaned on the chair, tilted his legs and did not drink tea. He said casually: "It’s all children’s tricks, of course I don’t care.” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the arrogant Su Ge, Ligan’s face is a bit bad, and the side of Burke’s yin and yang said: “The rumor Mr. Sotos is gentle and elegant, treating the goddess The people are warm and have no shelves. It seems that today is not in line with the rumors."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge’s answer is like a smile: “It’s all folks’ rumors, and they’re not credible.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? Avon followed Su Ge? This is no good, they are not separated, how do I clean up him, how to get his blood and hair?" The outside Mike's face is a bit ugly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gathering was originally organized by his uncle Burke. He passed the relationship with Marlow and asked Judy to invite Evan. thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But what he didn’t expect was that Su Ge actually came over and the two were so tight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn, that guy is a bishop, how is it so tight with this kind of people!" Mike scratched his head and whispered . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he was troubled, he did not notice that the atmosphere of the entire banquet had gradually changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second floor meeting room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Su Ge, Ligan and Burke, who looked at this attitude, found that their predictions for Su Ge were completely wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Originally they thought that since they are dependent on the relationship, they said two good words, flattering two sentences, even if they are strong, after all, they are Mike’s peers, nor Will force too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, two people are aware that Su Ge’s level is far beyond Mike, entering a kind of equality with them, even slightly They are a little higher than they are. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A moment of silence, Burke whispered: "Mr. Sotos, actually, please come over this time, I want to discuss with you about mysterious cases. In the case, if you can, please let this gentleman temporarily avoid it. This is for him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan knows nothing about this, listen to it. Asked Su Ge, a look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s hand waved, indicating that he didn’t have to leave, watching two people faintly said: “You’re a little trick, I’m very clear. But I admire you. Courage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you mean by Bishop Sotos?" Ligan's face changed slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s mouth reveals a sneer: “Do you think that you really used this legendary bishop as a display? What do you think I have spent a year from a nameless pawn? Come to this position?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people stared at Su Ge, did not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugna’s dark eyes look like two black holes: “I guess you will think that I am an illegitimate son of an archbishop, being brought to This position is essentially useless."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pump! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two people stunned in the heart, and Suguez’s score was not bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ligan looked at Su Ge and suddenly felt that the dark eyes had a magical power. Just looking at the past, the instinct was cold and people I am nervous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you carefully swallowed, Ligan didn’t dare to continue to see Sug’s strange black eyes, and hurriedly stopped looking at Burke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Berke is a man who has seen great winds and waves, still calmly, laughing: "Bishop, you think too much."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug said: "Is not much I want to know, you are very clear about yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Berke spread the stalls here: "Since the bishop is carrying ordinary people, it is not good to continue talking about it. Let's talk again, how?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." Su Ge Direct rejection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ligan took a deep breath and whispered: "Bishop Sotos, don't deceive too much!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It has been easy for God to send God since ancient times. Burke is a mysterious person. It should be very clear. Since I have come over, you have said Barabara for such a long time, it is my turn to say something."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Berke is still calm, with a smile on his lips: "The bishop is saying, please."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge put down his legs and leaned forward slightly: "I don't want to waste too much time in your little shackles, handing over the blood sacrifices, I will consider putting you in a way."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;! ! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, Berkton tightened his eyes and then laughed: "What does the bishop say? What is the sacrifice of blood?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge pointed to the ground: "Just back from the capital, the expert thief mysterious, just a few meters below the villa is still sucked It seems no coincidence that the tramp is dead."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pump! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The side of Ligan shakes and slides down from the chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Burke couldn’t hold it anymore, his face was gloomy: “How do you know? My hiding is seamless.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug did not answer: "Unfortunately, you met me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The message that thieves will appear here today It is estimated that you are leaking it? I want to blame the chaos and blame it on others. How do you blame it? Naturally, you curse Evan through blood, and introduce a mysterious person into the room according to the situation, then you bring Other mysterious people rushed in, so that person became the holder of the blood sacrifice, and became the target of the public, you can hide the power and name. And Evan, who offended Mike, will die because of the curse. "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This...this..." Hearing this Ligan's face was pale and shouted: "Who! Who leaked it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Avon sitting next to him is complex and pale, and finally knows why Suge has been in the past few days. Always told myself is so near. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Berke gradually tightened his fists, his attitude was full of cold: "I have to say that your calculations are the most terrible of the calculations I have ever seen. In this case, you must die today."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, slamming, the entire room was directly flooded with a thick smoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sug! Be careful!" Evan yelled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge pulled out a black handkerchief from his clothes and handed it to Evan: "Meng, this smoke is poisonous."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan rushed to pick up the black handkerchief: "What about you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This blood toxin is not poisonous." I am calm and calm, and I am not afraid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After applying a night clock, the aftermath of the night clock is heard at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, he captured a fast-moving figure that has come behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weapon's chisel broke open the night bell, followed by a sleeve of arrows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s right hand, as if he was playing with a straw, he would block the sleeve and remove it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then two screams, several sounds and sharp edges were shot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" A shock came from the fog, and then I heard the sound of the clothes being cut. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you see me?" The voice came from all directions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is calm and takes a step forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thick bells came out, with Su Ge as the center, the cold wind blowing around like a ripple in the water, blowing all the fog in the room. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that moment, the big men have brought the hood and took out the pistol and shot it on the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, this ordinary firearm can't even break the night clock of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan’s eyes widened as the bullets stopped in the air one meter in front of him, full of shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
