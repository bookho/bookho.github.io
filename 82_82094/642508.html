			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of the interrogation of clergy, Su Ge took the relevant identity documents and handed it over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few people said that there was no problem after the comparison, let the two leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that the church has been staring at it." Su Ge looked at the back of the clergy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley suddenly said: "Let's go buy clothes, just saw a very good clothing store."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good." Su Ge has ample patience and follows Shirley into the clothing store. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, a conference room inside the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several archbishops in Laurie sitting together with a portrait in their hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This portrait is based on the memory of the clergy last night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tall hat, dark sleeveless trench coat, special cloud-like texture, and the unique silver mask and cane, Laurie nodded and said: "It is him. , Sog Sotos."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing that Laurie confirmed that the man in a golden robe with a mask icy out: "He is this It is in the open authority to provoke the authority of the goddess, the endurance of the church, and now I am drafting an order to list the arrest of Suger Sotos as a red order."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;An archbishop at his side asked: "Is the Archbishop of Saru, is this good? Because of the departure of the expeditionary force, our mysterious defense system is relatively empty now, and there is not much manpower and energy to arrest it. A difficult heresy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Archbishop of Saru faintly asked: "What do you mean by letting him continue to trample on the dignity of the goddess?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course not!" The female archbishop hurriedly shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saru turned to look at Laurie: "What do you think of Archbishop Laurie?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laurie said calmly: "Without too many people, ordinary clergy can not pose a threat to him. If you can, it is good for you and me to arrest him."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You and me?" Saru heard this accident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Laurie nodded seriously: "I must seize him, at any cost!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp In that battle, the only student who was proud of himself died because of Su Ge, and his reputation was greatly damaged. He can say that he has great resentment and hatred for Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saru was silent for a few seconds, then said: "Yes, what plans do you have, you can say it directly."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Laurie answered seriously: "My plan is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the church is planning its own plan, Su Ge is also planning Do yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the afternoon he came to Duke’s estate and began to give his uncle a replacement ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole ceremony was completed by Su Ge himself. Because he has done it several times, he is very skilled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two hours later, after he used his cold flame to feed the invisible messenger that Su Ge couldn’t see, he continued to stun the middle-aged man. wake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This made Duke and Stephen very happy and excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wake up, Wright first ate something under the servant's service and took a shower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He feels very good. He has already learned the whole process through the servant and Stephen's tongue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a decent black suit, he was very grateful and respectful: "Mr. Black Mist, thank you for your help, thank you. You have won me." Wright Hausman’s sincere friendship.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this kindness, Su Ge took it very rudely, and after a simple chat, Sug The subject asked: "Who is the woman who caused all this? Where is it now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wright stunned his head and said, "I drank too much that night. I was obsessed with seeing a beautiful woman. I couldn’t remember what happened after that. I only remember what I met at Mrs. Merris’s party. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke listened to the helpless spread of the handkerchief: "One night stand is like this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Su Ge has some helplessness, and he intends to find the location of the master ghoul along the female ghoul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who is Mrs. Merris?" Su Ge asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke said: "Mrs. Merris is the Duke of Empire Lilac, the wife of the Duke of Merris. The old duke died two years ago, after which the entire family has been Mrs. Merris is responsible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stephan added: "Mrs. Merris has a high reputation in the nobility, and has a wide network of contacts, often holding some dinners and The ball meets and helps other people in need to find connections and relationships."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "By going to bed?" Su Ge brows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wright explained: "Going to bed is just a barrier to contact, but just such a threshold also makes countless underlying men and women rush."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a chaos in your circle." Su Ge couldn't imagine the filthy scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wright smiled a little embarrassed and sighed: "But from this time on, I won't be looking for a woman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadow of this incident, it is estimated that Wright can't go out in this life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke noticed the details of Su Ge and asked: "Do you have anything to help?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded directly and said: "I need to catch the female ghoul, I have some problems to solve from her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wright helpless The sigh: "I am sorry, if it is a small aristocrat, I asked directly in the past. But the status of Mrs. Merris, even if we can not easily touch."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge touched his chin and said, "If I can see it in the past, I should be able to find her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke’s eyes lit up and turned to look Stephen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stepne smiled and said: "It’s a coincidence that Mrs. Merris had just sent an invitation to the young master this morning, and there was a time at the Duke’s Manor at eight o’clock in the evening. Party."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well!?" Su Ge’s eyes lit up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke sighed: "I have a lot of entertainment every day, and some unimportant ones can push it. This is going to be pushed, if you need it, Let's take a look at it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is also welcome, nodded: "This is the best, it is also convenient to help you to get rid of the aftermath."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the goal was determined, the two of them left home early, and both of them needed to clean up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because there are too many things to prepare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back home, Su Ge raised his right hand glove and looked and sighed: "This evening will be very lively, I have this strong feeling." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl comfortably lies on the bed and says, "Go tonight, I won't go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well!?" Hearing this, Suggton felt a little surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley took the bedside book: "I want to read the novel, just to see the wonderful part."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of Shirley's reasons, Su Ge did not know how to refuse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a few seconds of silence, sigh: "Well, you are happy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snow Lill curled up his mouth and squatted on the bed, swinging up and down the black and silky sexy calf, looking very happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
