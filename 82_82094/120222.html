			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold wind swells around the black mist, like a myriad of ghosts wandering, ghastly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hypnotist has clearly felt that he has completely lost control of his nightmare world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pump! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a second, the hypnotist trembled on the ground, then squatted down and put his head on the ground, fearing the corners of his eyes. Yu Guang saw something that should not be seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This...this...He is definitely a true god!" The hypnotist felt that his body was shaking and his brain was constantly shuddering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spirit, the will, the inspiration, the flesh, and even the rationality, the memory is so trembled and reaches the edge of the collapse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪嗒! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Familiar sounds, the hypnotist saw his vision of the moment skyrocketing from 31 to 70. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instant, an indescribable fear, anxiety, frenziedness, madness, panic, temper is filled in his brain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just like forcing a timid person to see the most horrible ghost film in the world, this kind of madness makes the spirit of the hypnotist instantly confuse and collapse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, ah, ah! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the original, full of animal screams resounded throughout the nightmare space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug holds a long gun standing there and is motionless. He looks at the hypnotist in a condescending manner. It is clear through the vision of the god that his spirit has collapsed and his will is completely The disintegration, the soul is full of cracks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He, can't live anymore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wolf knight in the sky fell respectfully, forming a guard standing behind Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The screams are still going on. In the screams, the hypnotist is completely crazy. He suddenly stands up and his eyes still don’t dare to look at Su Ge. Instead, he turned directly and stretched out his own hands and dug his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is no bloody tear to tear down your own ears, the palm of your blood is constantly gripping on the body, as if you want to tear your skin down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Instinct wants to get rid of this outside fear from hearing, sight, and touch? The idea is good, but it dirty my eyes."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Su Ge raised his rifle in his hand and casually pointed forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cold wind instantly wraps the hypnotist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the blink of an eye, the hypnotist who was completely mad has turned into a crystal ice sculpture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My Lord, this little thing is handed over to our servants." Chuck jumped off the ghost wolf and walked over and said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger said faintly: "Occasionally, the body is not bad. Let's go, this dirty place is not worth our stay."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, Su Ge took off and flew back to the battleship...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the real world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart extinguished the green flame of his finger, in front of Nelson's head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the body, it has completely disappeared from the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A group of madmen." Bart sighed and turned to look at Su Ge, who was sitting still on the ground, and his body was full of strength and a look Vigilant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Just let me see how an apprentice escaped from the hands of a professional hypnotist." Bart did not intend to help Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has always been curious and conjectured about Su Ge’s true identity. If Su Ge really said it, then this level of hypnosis is absolutely impossible to trap him. of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the credibility of the words that Su Ge said is very high, but it is ultimately his own brain, whether it is still to be verified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are cheated, you will lose money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Bart didn’t mean anything at this time, and wanted to find out the true details of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Pat is waiting patiently...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly a muffled sound, something not far from the beam fell on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I remember only the hypnotist on the beam?" When he came in, Bart noticed the position of the hypnotist, but he never saw it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the spirit exhausted?" Bart walked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, just two steps away, he suddenly felt a bit of chill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This cold is terrible, and if measured by standards, it is at least minus 100 degrees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My God! What the hell is going on!" Bart, who dared not approach, saw the hypnotist about three meters away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point the hypnotist has completely turned into a pale ice sculpture, and the whole body is frozen and transparent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the thick ice, Bart saw the distorted face of the hypnotist, and the large amount of blood on his eyes, ears, and hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My Lord is on! To cause such a cold, this requires at least a master-level Frost Warlock, no, the master level is not enough, to a higher level ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No! No!" Suddenly, Bart found the problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This cold is not imposed by the outside world, but is infiltrated through the spirit and soul, freezing the whole body from the inside out."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The cold that permeates from the spirit and the soul...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, Bart suddenly turned his head and looked at Sugue, who was sitting still.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is, all this is Su Ge's handwriting? Do not! impossible! This kind of horror energy that crosses the dimension through the spiritual link and turns from the imaginary number to the real number is not an apprentice, even a master can't do it. Thinking of reaching this level requires at least the power of the sage. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you say ~! "Bart's heart thumped and began to accelerate, and a tremor that could not control itself gradually spread from a tiny idea to his whole body.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咔咔...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking that the body that was completely frozen to death did not melt, but split from the middle.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The complete ice sculpture has become neatly turned into two halves. As can be seen from the cross section, the body of the hypnotist has been completely crystallized and turned into a part of the ice.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;But seeing this, Bart’s heart is more trembling, because such ability, even the sage is far from being able to reach.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, this is not over yet. Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two halves of the ice sculpture are neat four, eight, sixteen, thirty-two...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In the subtle sounds, the ice sculptures quickly split into geometric speeds, very neat, and not bad.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Bart’s gaze, but half a minute The time, just the complete body, has split into countless beans-sized particles, scattered on the ground.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, these divisions are still proceeding rapidly... ...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This power...this power..." Bart didn't dare to continue watching, the body's instinctive receding on the wall in two steps, his face pale. The shock is undecided.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can’t understand, he can’t understand it, he can’t see it. This level of power goes far beyond the limits he can understand, even Beyond the limits of his worldview.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
