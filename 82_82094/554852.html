			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot! boom! boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a large space, there are bursts of horrible explosions from time to time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge was kicked out by the giant emperor. If it wasn’t for the cane to become an umbrella in front of him, Su Ge estimated that the sternum was broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the case, Su Ge’s hands are numb with shock and temporarily lose consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;噗嗤! Aside, Gerlos seized the opportunity, first a psionic shield blocked the giant's attack, and then the frosty sword directly penetrated his waist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, a burst of hoarfrost is like an endless poison that is infused into his body, quickly eroding all his body tissues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle has been going on for half an hour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be said that it is very difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first batch of air warriors attacked very sharp, comparable to the Su Ge sound wave blade, even after breaking, you can also blew in place, the power and grenades are similar, very Tricky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, four people handled it properly and did not cause too much interference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the air warrior was finished, the four people could finally attack in close proximity, but soon the giant emperor let them know the horror of the emperor emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrew’s horrible sword screamed and screamed, but at the moment of approaching the giant, it was like seeing his father’s son, and the moment was languid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger’s sonic blade immediately dissipated as it approached the giant, and turned into a breeze without any lethality, as if Su Ge was fanning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Randall Shadow Bolt and Vampire Bat, who are directly betrayed by the giants, turn their heads to Randall’s own bite, and finally the blue Del killed them all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor's rule is everywhere, weapons, knowledge, psionics, biology, and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing the three people can break his emperor's rule. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, they still have Gerlos, who is infinitely close to the lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only the four of the four people holding the blazing sword, Gerlos did not receive an impact, can attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the power of the attack is also attenuated by the problem of dominance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a simple observation, Su Ge can only use the most rogue ability, that is, consumption. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The psionic power of the giant is not endless. Although he is the lord level, it is necessary to consume psionic power to launch the control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now Su Ge’s psionic level is equal to that of the giant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Su Ge said nothing, hiding in the distance for half an hour uninterrupted release of the fierce sonic attack, consuming the other's psionic power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Ander and Andrew are not idle, continue their attacks to consume the giant's psionic power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the giant is not so sitting and waiting, he has taken the initiative several times in the middle, first using the emperor's pressure to cause fear to three people, and then directly control the three people of Su Ge . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when he was about to succeed, the late night of Sogna’s soul instantly disintegrated his offensive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It can be said that the night of the soul of Su Ge is the natural enemy of all spiritual spells, almost unreasonable to dispel the vast majority of spiritual control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, dispelling the dominance of the lord is not simple, and the psionic power of Suge is naturally much more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s good, Su Ge has a lot of people, and there is also a Jeros who is similar in strength to the Giants and has a bloody suppression of the Giants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half an hour without intermittent consumption, the giant's face became paler and he became more and more anxious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, his psionic power has bottomed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are four people screaming and slashing at the giant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, even if the giant has no psionic power, the physical strength is terrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug, this kind of physical waste, with the artifact of the Great God Declaration, rushed up, even if the skin is broken every time, it was smashed by others. come back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Andrew’s top master warrior and Randall seized the opportunity to entangle the attention of the giant, and Gerlos succeeded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dimension of hoarfrost is several grades higher than the current form of the giant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hoarfrost that entered the body could not resist, only to die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pump! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant is sitting weakly on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time sitting on the ground are Su Ge three people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three men were panting at this time, and the chest was breathing like a bellows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss’s face is not good, but it’s still normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time he spit out a sigh of relief, standing not far from the giant body, watching his gradually frozen body ask: "What is the last word?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant body is shaking violently, pale and like a dead person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you...have found your own beliefs?" the giant asked, shaking his voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerlos nodded: "Found, this hoarfrost is what He has given me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;"He... is it a true god?" the giant asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerousus continues to nod: "Yes, the Lord of Death and Storm, the only true God of the Abyss, the ruler of dreams, the dominator of death, the ruler of the fog ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant smiled and nodded: "Good luck, Your Royal Highness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "What are the last words?" Gerlos asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant turned to look at the Holy Grail: "I want to be buried with my wife."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Cough and cough..." Su Ge coughed over and said palely: "Yes, you will get eternal peace with your wife in the Holy Grail. In the future, the Holy Grail will help people resist." The core weapon of those evil spirits."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant glanced at Su Ge and asked, "What is your name?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sug Sotos." Su Ge answered truthfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant seems to be clear, four faces, blinking in eight eyes The brilliant brilliance like a star turned into a crystal ice sculpture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his complete death, a burst of gray light emerged from his body into the Holy Grail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His body quickly shrinks and eventually becomes a normal person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But his mutated head did not return to normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a change!" Randall said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge turned his head and saw that the lines on the Holy Grail became more precise, while the water chest angle became more real, just like the entity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge a sword squats under the head of the emperor, and the other hand is holding the huge skull silently toward the altar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adults are careful! This is the Holy Grail after all!" Randall reminded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrew also reminded: "Keep your heart, don't fall into the illusion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge finished Take a deep breath and add a night clock to yourself. Then the night of the soul of the town echoes in your mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss did not follow the past, but stood not far away, with a look of vigilance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gradually ascend to the altar, Suger heard an indescribable whisper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn’t know what these whispers are saying, but from the tone he seems to be commanding himself to do something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whisper has a special magical power that makes people gradually lose their mind when they listen, and instinctively obeys what He meant to do something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Su Ge is not an ordinary person, the night of the soul of the town is constantly echoing, these can be said that the whisper of madness is of no use to Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the altar, Su Ge looked at the glorious holy grail and placed the two heads underneath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Grail seemed to be inductive, and immediately extended two large tentacles to pull these two things in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor’s head is integrated into the pyramid above the Holy Grail, and the skull blends into the pyramid below. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咔咔咔...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a burst of swearing chews, it’s unspeakable The light suddenly burst out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The illusory Holy Grail quickly condenses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corners turn black and the entire outer casing becomes golden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two star-shaped eyes on the top and bottom pyramids. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Numerous golden lines spread all over the entire Grail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, the Holy Grail can be said to have possessed an entity, and the voice of whispers has become even bigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This seems to be a kind of chanting, and it seems to be a kind of prayer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s face is not very good, but it can still be held. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the Holy Grail at this time and found that there was a missing connection point between the two pyramids. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After owning the entity, Sug saw that the two pyramid tips were not completely linked, with a gap of about one centimeter in between. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this, Sug turned to look at Jellos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerousus nodded slightly, and took out a dagger and cut his wrist. He came out of the altar and shed his bright red blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that his blood is constantly flowing out, Gerlos doesn’t seem to hear those whispers, his face is relieved and happy: “This thing has afflicted our family for hundreds of thousands of years. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My father will go crazy because of this whisper, killing my mother and killing me." Gerlos said calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg asks: "After?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerlos said with a blank expression: "I killed him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge's eyes gradually widened, with a trace of incredible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The reason why I became a demon hunter is to avoid this whisper. Because only by entering the galaxy maze and touching the power of other ancient gods, can the two be Neutral."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Su Ge looked at the calm look of Gerlos, sighed for a few seconds after silence: "Everything is gone." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Haha! Yeah! It’s all gone!" Gerlos heard this and suddenly smiled happily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
