			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of sudden hatred, this makes Su Ge brow furrow: "Do you know me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"亵渎者!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Killing fellows!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two monsters sing one and one Loudly loud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug immediately thought of his experience of killing the witch before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't their spirits, or memories, be connected to each other?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking, Su Ge suddenly heard a shout: "Be careful!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;噗嗤! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, a squirt of liquid directly from the son's mouth, shot to Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the last experience, Su Ge did not use the psionic shield this time, and with a straight cane, he opened the umbrella to block the filthy object. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Follow-up, a dozen or so invisible sharp blades are instantly issued, tangential to the body of two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two people’s bodies seem to be inflexible, and the body is instantly cut off by the invisible blade, and the body slams into the ground and cannot move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The limbs were cut off, but the two monsters did not have any pain. The four eyes stared at Su Ge from resentment, then suddenly opened their mouths and pointed at Su Ge. There was a very harsh scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, Su Ge suddenly felt a horrible monster suddenly appear in front of him, and his open mouth would swallow himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though Su Ge can smell the stench in his mouth, and the countless disgusting tentacles and suckers in his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"咚!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge is calm and does not move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thick bell suddenly sounded, and the two monsters felt the black feathers falling in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this!!" The two men saw the feathers suddenly felt a deep fear from the bottom of their hearts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗷嗷嗷! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the horrible monster that turned out of the illusion suddenly gave a shrill mourning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This feather seems to have tremendous power and instantly wipe out this huge monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two monsters blinked at this moment, don’t know why, they suddenly saw that there were four black wings on the back of the person. Over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kill you! Kill you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sacrifice!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Evil!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Soul!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"骸骨!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two monsters groaned, their bodies actually began to absorb the dead body of the student. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the blink of an eye, they become two humanoid monsters that seem to be pinched together by a few people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged people on the side saw this, his face was pale, and he screamed and fell directly to the ground, fainting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge brows slightly wrinkled: "This quirky activity is similar to the witch, but does not reach the level of the witch."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Su Ge did not use his own cold flame, but used the sound wave blade to cut the body of two people and test the limits of two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be seen that the two monsters have to rush a few times, and the body is instantly cut off by the invisible blade and thrown to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continue to heal and continue to be cut. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few times, Sug found that their form was gradually shrinking, and that the crazy idea was gradually lost, without the initial frenzy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They are burning their vitality and soul! What are they linking?" Su Ge was immersed in contemplation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mysterious world, any mysterious phenomenon has a certain source, these sources are often the existence of a certain state of terror in history, generally pointing to the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And just like Evan’s curse, if not enough devout believers, borrowing their powers would cost a hundredfold or even a thousand times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who made you look like this?" Su Ge asked, whispering slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The will of the two people has been blurred, and the instinct murmured: "No one, this is our fate, this is our destination, great...great The..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two big mouths seem to want to say something, but they can’t say it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After five seconds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touch! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heads of the two people suddenly burst from the part of the celestial cover, countless blood and brains, splashing everywhere, very disgusting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The father and son fell to the ground and died completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this, Su Ge opened his eyes and swept around, and said in his heart: "Sure enough, as Moore said, you can't see the soul." On the ground, the bodies of the two men began to curl up at this moment, and in the blink of an eye they became like a mummy, and the head was bursting open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After confirming that two people were completely inactive, Su Ge looked around at the body of a student who was not adult on the ground and sighed: "You can only say that you are not lucky,"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;So Su Ge prepares the souls of the three to purify. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Su Ge once again discovered that the souls of these three people were also sucked away by the mysterious power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, Su Ge felt the inspiration flashed a bit of aversion, feeling a mysterious existence crawling behind him, peeping himself, approaching himself . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole body is erected, and Su Ge instantly utters all his psionic power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;唰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four huge wings suddenly stretched out, and the innumerable dark wings fluttered in the air like snowflakes. Su Ge’s eyes burned with ghosts and screams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咕噜咕噜...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that there is something in the water to breathe bubbles and I don’t know where It sounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嘶嘶嘶, then the sound of something rubbing and creeping slowly drifted away, as if a huge monster gradually moved away from the Suger head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪嗒! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately, Su Ge found that his vision had risen a bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What the hell is it? Is it peeping at me, or want to kill me?" Su Ge clenched his fists, and some of his heart was awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has the feeling that if he didn’t just start the wing of death, then the monster would instantly entangle himself from behind him and drag him into the unknown. In the abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wing of the psionic virtualization gradually dissipated, and Suge gasped slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His body is still unable to eat the shape of the night bell, and now his limit is to use the psionic power to morph the wings of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This thing is a little troublesome." Su Ge thought, picking up the professor who was fainted and ready to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just at the moment of getting up, Su Ge looked at the blackboard in the classroom and suddenly stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a tall altar on the blackboard. There is a man on the altar holding the cup in his hands and looking at the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the altar, a large number of people are kneeling underneath. It can be seen that the people on the ground have already mutated and become grotesque at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is... Byron the Great!?" Su Ge saw this look amazed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just knew some of the truth about Byron the Great, and when I saw such a scene, he immediately remembered about the destruction of the Byron Empire because of the Holy Grail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who is this picture!" Su Ge thought about it, looking down at the middle-aged man in his arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that these two monsters are not blindly fleeing here, but are attracted by this thing..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking, Su Ge returned to the downstairs with a middle-aged man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When everyone looked at Su Ge with a look, everyone was deeply relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bishop, how?" The clergyman hurriedly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug will lay down the middle-aged man and say: "Block the third floor 306 classroom, any police, no students can be close. Notify the cathedral, add personnel to protect the scene The school is closed for one day today."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!" The sinner immediately turned around and quickly left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Returning this middle-aged man to the church, he was frightened and caused a sharp rise in the spirit, so that Father Hank took care of him and must keep him sensible. I There are important things to ask him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!" The two exorcist nuns took out the stretcher immediately, carrying the middle-aged professor in the other two gods. Leave quickly under escort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After commanding, Su Ge took the hat and said to Harden: "I will hand it over to you, I will go back to the cathedral."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Bishop !" Harden said seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the attention of the group, Su Ge left the school in a carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 12:30, in the Basilica of the Holy Blood, in the large prayer hall, there are two people, Su Ge and Emilia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge said things in detail, but did not say that he never got the news from the fortress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listening, Emilia said indulgently: "The painting on the blackboard, no accident should be Byron the Great."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Byron the Great?" Sugg pretended to meditate and then asked: "Is the thing he took is the Holy Grail?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "It should be, but I don't know exactly what the situation is. As for the painting, it is one of the external scriptures from the Byron Secret. The pattern is found in the ancient slabs left by the tide of death. But what is the significance of this painting, and people have not studied it yet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger’s temptation asks: "You think this event and Is there any relationship between the witches and the ancient Byron the Great?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Relationship!?" Emilia brows wrinkled into contemplation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This thing should be related to the witch's runaway, but it is somewhat unrealistic to have a relationship with Byron the Great 30,000 years ago. That era, already And now completely severed, there is no relationship."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge nodded thoughtfully and asked: "The Archbishop, what should be this thing? "?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is something going on in the Holy See. I can't estimate too much here. It's up to you to take responsibility for this matter." Emily Ya said something absent-minded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened? Su Ge didn’t ask much. He took a deep breath and said, “Yes, I’m worried that I can’t handle it in some cases. I need a helper. ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
