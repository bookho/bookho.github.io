			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge carefully walked up the steps and looked at the roads on both sides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The left side leads to an oval stand, but there is a huge iron gate in the middle that stops Su Ge’s way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, this iron gate can’t stop Su Ge’s. The main reason he didn’t want to go is that it’s too close to the swollen woman in the fog. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then continue down the steps on the right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across this step, Su Ge came to a prototype turntable full of wild grass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transfer station has this step up, and there is a huge iron gate on the left hand side. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gate is about five meters high, six meters wide, thick and icy, made of steel with the thickness of the arm, and has a sharp tip at the bottom. Pierced into the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge looked down at the spear tip that pierced the ground, reached out and touched the dust, and how much he could restore some of the scenes through the crack and depth. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The penetration is about 30 centimeters deep, which is not a natural penetration. It should be pulled out of the ground directly from the highest position."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge raised his head and saw that the chain on the side of the hand brake had been broken, indicating that someone was hurriedly cutting the chain and letting the door out of control. fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slap the dust on his hand, and Sug looked through the gap in the middle of the iron gate, and couldn’t help but take a deep breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inside of the gate is a very wide square with a relatively high disc in the middle, a beautiful relief on the ground, and the core has this The head, a majestic and robust statue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are four similar gates around the square leading to four directions. At this time, three have been dropped, and only the gate opposite Su Ge is still open. With. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is not the grandeur of the square that makes Su Ge breathe, but the hundreds of thousands in the middle of the square. I don’t know how many years of strange bones have been piled up. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These bones are piled together, they are intertwined with each other, some of the shin bones are covered with spurs, some sacral heads are scary, and some sacral bones are curled into one ball. ............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These bones don’t know how many years have passed, the bones are black, they seem to have been burnt, or these people are burned by flames. of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; can see the struggle and madness of these people before their death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people’s leg bones are in the mouths of other cheekbones, some people’s phalanges are in the eyes of other cheekbones, and some people’s skulls are completely broken and held by people. In the arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time these cheekbones fell to the ground in various poses, and they were covered by black, black oil like oil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this black, oily thing, Sugna’s divergent thoughts instantly went to a terrible scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people are some innocent escapers, but they are physically contaminated. When they escape, they are directly cut off by the door and trapped in the middle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the fire burned, they burned their bodies, hair, and body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body burned by the horrible flame, the fat, the internal organs gradually melted, and the ash became these strange oily things attached to the cheekbones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嘶嘶嘶...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I thought of this Sugerton, I had a chill, and I had some nausea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horrible calorie-burning corpse, the disgusting scene of fatty oil flowing out of the human skin, allowed Su Ge to suffocate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Grandma's, thinking about what this thing is doing, it's just dead." Su Ge patted his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second side of the two stood up at this moment, and the two claws caught on the iron fence, and the narrow mouth stretched in, seeming to get in from the fist-sized gap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, two goods!" Su Ge grabbed its neck and flesh and pulled it down, looking at the strange square road with awe! "This place is still better than some."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The swollen woman in the fog has cast a shadow on Sugmon, he is now a lot of these cities. The place does not dare to explore too deeply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Step by step to the upper level of the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no difference between the building on this floor and the bottom. It is very small and messy. You can see clothes, daily necessities, and even chairs and nursery cars that are still on the ground. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that there has been a terror incident that has shrouded the entire city. This incident is like the end of the world, causing all residents to flee in horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result seems to be that none of these people are spared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The groundwater manhole covers a burst of light white steam, and there seems to be something underneath that is evaporating water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug immediately stopped and released the aftermath of the night clock to detect it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then his eyes twitched slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sewer, Sug saw the bodies of two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the two sinners, professional, from the psionic volatility of the Church of the Holy Blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the two skins seem to burn with flames. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the world of the aftermath, Su Ge clearly felt the incomparably intense psionic fluctuations and the high temperatures of terror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are both in the sewage, and the hot temperature quickly evaporates the surrounding water and emanates from the manhole cover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge didn't know how the two entered the sewer, nor could he determine how the two became this strange form. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flames seem to burn from the inside out of their bodies, and when Suge peeped, the fierce psionic burst out, followed by two The body began to burn intensely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Su Ge did not smell any smell, but smelled a pungent smell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This smell Suge smelled. When he was a child, he was full of air and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the taste of sulfur. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sulphur..." refers to the word, and Su Ge has cast a shadow on his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because there is no more common vocabulary on the earth, it has a different meaning here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many things in the world that represent something horrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the sheep's head represents evil, the five-pointed star represents the Yi, the stars represent the gods, and the aurora represents the cult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sulfur represents: the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Higher creatures, non-artificial objects created by the ancient gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The end of the gods, after the great changes in the world, the whole world is no longer suitable for the devil to live. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because they need to constantly consume a lot of sulfur to maintain their energy and form. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were many active volcanoes in the world when they were in the world, and they could get a lot of sulfur during that time. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after the gods, the heavens and the earth changed greatly, and the demons gradually faded out of the human vision and gathered in a place suitable for them to live. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Somewhere here, referring to: the abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the abyss, no one has figured it out so far. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the Wolf Legion does not know what the abyss represents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People only know that the abyss is the most distorted, darkest, most dangerous, and most ferocious place in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the constant efforts of the Wolf Blood Legion, people gradually discovered that the abyss is divided into twelve layers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The twelve layers are not the same as the building’s top-down twelve floors, but like twelve sheets of messy shapes and shapes. Was smashed into a ball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire abyss is detected to be elliptical, and in this ellipse the twelve layers of paper are staggered and twisted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the world, no one knows how to distinguish the twelve layers except the Wolf Legion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the information that Suge knows from the church, each layer of the abyss is like a separate world. It may be a mountain, a city, or even just a city. It is a small house, and it may be a sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, it is worth noting that the area is full of surprises and dangers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it is the habitat of all the monsters of the ancient times, the Yi people, and the channel of the world and the twisted void link. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Yi people in the astral world, the external god's tentacles are through the twisted void into the abyss, and then from the abyss into the human world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most central point of all intelligence is the reddish font. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abyss, is alive! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vast abyss is like a horror monster that holds twelve worlds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People don’t know if they have self-awareness, but what is certain is that its tentacles have been extended to the rules of the world, its horror and bad luck through causality Destiny is associated with all who have relationships and entanglements with it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The famous adage of the Wolf Blood Legion is: When you are staring at the abyss, the abyss is also staring at you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any direct view is relative. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And just gazing, the strange abyss can interfere with your destiny through sight, destroying your life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many records say that the abyss itself is a god of ancient times, but it has fallen into an unconscious sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is supportive of this statement, because this horrible thing has completely met the criteria of all gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the power is far beyond the many legendary gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Su Ge returned from his thoughts, he discovered that the two clerics of the sewer had become a pile of ashes, and it was not known to follow the flowing sewage. Where is it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sign makes Su Ge more vigilant, and at the same time, he starts to think about what is here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Andrew said that the whole city is divided into the side and the inside. We are just on the inside of the outer city, thrown here by the repairs, it should still be in the city. The inside side. Is this the inner side of the inner city?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge brows slightly wrinkled, eyes constantly looking around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he found that the layout of the inner city is completely different from the original one. The most obvious thing is that there is no palace in this city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether on the side or inside, you must rely on something that has a real existence and a real concept. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is obvious that the corresponding law has been removed from the front and back sides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "According to Andrew, the core of this call is probably the one from the abyss skull, the skull is the direct son of Byron, the skull of Karl's variation, He himself has had a deep relationship with the abyss, and even summoned the Byron and the Holy Grail in the abyss."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you follow this line of thinking, is it true that the Byron Dias people made a connection through the skull and the abyss in the process of summoning, thus forming some special passages or links. Just just repairs Turning over, we threw the city from the inside into the abyss city below the inner city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Su Ge’s thinking gradually became smoother. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The inner city is real, but it is hidden behind the reality. There are many things on the inside that are not real, even obvious. False feeling and disobedience. But here is different, here my night clock can be stretched normally, and the newly swollen woman is also real. So it is very likely that this is not the inner world, but the back side of the world. And this city is located in a certain layer of the abyss. The two clerics who have just died should be killed by the abyss demon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea is completely smooth Su Ge is more vigilant about this dead city. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the devil is not a star outside the starry sky, there is no such difference in the ability of the Yi people, but as a native creature, the overall battle is higher than the normal Yi people. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under normal circumstances, the strength of the flame demon that can be seen at 35 points is stronger than the conventional experts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the characteristics of Su Ge, it can be judged that these two gods are attacked by the flame demon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜呜呜呜...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, there was another scream in the distance Hey, Su Ge stood here and looked in the direction of the sound. Through the crowded cusp gap, he faintly saw a ring-shaped high platform in a relatively high place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the high stage, there is a vague shadow that cannot be seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it his voice?" Su Ge moved in his heart and continued to follow the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crowded and messy paths are twists and turns, and from time to time there will be some dark roads and garbage alleys. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Erha stood up next to Su Ge’s ear, and a pair of ice blue eyes widened and looked around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, it also feels the danger and extraordinary of this place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪嗒!啪嗒......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the walking sound of the leather shoes on the ground is slowly approaching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unseen Suge feels happy, he squeezes his cane in an instant, alert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the footsteps, there is a burst of heavy friction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This friction sounds like a certain metal is being carried forward by a person on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to be a steel pipe, and it seems to be a certain heavy object. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aftermath of the evening bell was released, and Su Ge then sighed: "I know this is the case."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few seconds, a two-meter tall, sturdy and even bloated body came out of the alley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of this monster is a member of the Holy Sword team, Su Ge from his silver-gray armor, the steam sword on the ground Can judge his identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time the Holy Sword has made a horrible variation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He seems to have suffered severe corrosion on his body, his skin is gone, and the red skin is bare outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, he attached a lot of dark bones to his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These bones are filled with a black oily liquid through which the completely scattered bones are connected to each other to form a creepy bone ooze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time the ooze is attached to the body of the holy swordsman, the black oil has filled his eyes and mouth, and the black human skeleton is attached to the holy The body of the sword team even fits into his muscles and controls his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Those things are actually alive!?" Su Ge instantly recalled the black material he had just seen passing through the square. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time he was very fortunate that he did not die to fly over the gate to see what it was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be seen here that these things should also belong to the possessive monsters, in order to encroach on the enemy's body as the main means. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh The hoe was like the second head he had grown up, the black hole eyes staring at himself, and the squat slowly opened under the black oil link, making a disgusting cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗡嗡嗡...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the moment of seeing Su Ge, this holy swordsman Screwing the holy sword in his hand, the roar of the motor suddenly sounded, and then the strong body slammed the holy sword almost in the blink of an eye and came to Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hurry, his physical strength has actually been enhanced!" Su Ge was shocked and immediately propped up the night bell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sacred sword was cut on the master’s night clock, as if it was cut on a thick clock, and a low-pitched roar was heard. The night clock was suddenly broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the monster here is bounced by the vibration of the night bell, the holy sword was directly released by the shock, and fell on the ground and directly pierced the floor tiles. , inserted in the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monster is equally uncomfortable, its body trembles constantly, the body is uncontrollably violently shaken, like a half-length, back a few steps backwards, powerless 跪on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The attack of the Holy Sword is indeed fierce, and actually opened the master's night clock with a professional-level blow." Su Ge was a little surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then, he looked at the monster sitting on the ground and couldn’t stand up and said: "But it is professional."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night clock that has just been blessed by knowledge has not only defense, but also a strong defensive counterattack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment of the impact, the evening bell protects the constantly vibrating sound wave and transmits it to his body through the holy sword, letting his body follow the night bell The frequency produces a strong vibration resonance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horrible amplitude and jitter make it numb, muscle congestion, ligament tear, broken bones, and loss of all mobility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second then flew around him for two laps, the blue eyes were full of curiosity, and also squirming his black nose to smell it. Smell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;噗嗤! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After smelling, the second time suddenly slammed and then stepped back. After a sneeze, turned and stretched out his claws and grabbed it on the ground. It seems to be a bad one. The thing was buried.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge couldn’t help but laugh at the two goods, then came over and carefully looked at the saboteur who lost his ability to move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as Su Ge approached, the black mud attached to the holy swordsman suddenly surged and quickly disengaged from the body of the holy swordsman. Su Ge's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is very calm, without any suggestion of dodging, it seems that he is very convinced that this thing will not cause a trace of harm and pollution to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second side of the two haha ​​has been very alert to help the owner stare at this unpleasant thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the black mud was about to contact Su Ge’s clothes, Erha suddenly opened his mouth and spewed a white chill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咔咔咔...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horrible chill has a whitish-like instant freezing ability . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In less than a second, the black mud becomes a quirky ice sculpture, parked less than a centimeter from the corner of Su Ge . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The holy swordsman was unable to kneel on the ground, the strange black mud skeleton half of his body, half attached to his body, and this time is completely Icing, like the armor of his body was half frozen, it was very strange, and the artistry of this kind of abstraction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge circumvented the statue slightly, looked down at the head and was a holy swordsman with the upper body already exposed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person is dead, and Su Ge does not even feel his residual soul and psionic power. It is estimated that he was eaten by the monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "All the monsters here have the means of attacking spirits, and they are the monsters derived from the Holy Grail of the Soul. There is really a set for the soul and spirit." Sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He does not intend to move this body, let him be here in this way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lobo has the same ability as his god, just the cold wind is naturally the most pure hoarfrost, even stronger than Gerros's hoarfrost . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is quite sure that this black mud skeleton monster is dead and can no longer die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continue along the road, the buildings in front are getting denser and denser, and there are more and more pieces of garbage on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is confident and steady, with his own night clock, plus Lobo's hearing and smell, Su Ge has absolute confidence in vigilance detection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This also makes his pace at this time look very leisurely, giving people a feeling of not taking risks, but taking a walk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the city for more than an hour, Su Ge has just seen There are no other living creatures outside the monster, let alone familiar humans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole city is very large and very winding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After walking, Su Ge found himself lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the impression he obviously went up, but after walking around, when he came up from an uphill path, he accidentally found himself back. The location of the first dilapidated chapel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this ghost situation?" Su Ge did not rush to continue this action, but to find a place to sit down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After walking for more than an hour in a row, he was already a little tired and did not dare to continue to rush, which would only waste his energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After returning to his original position, Erha had a trace of doubt in his eyes, and he seemed to understand how he came back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While Su Ge was resting and contemplating, it couldn’t go down to the small church full of dust and rubble, and rummaging through the boxes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗷呜呜! Hey! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After not knowing how many cans were crushed and how many cabinets were knocked down, Erha suddenly made a strange call. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug returned to God and rushed over, just to see the whole body is dusty, standing in the middle of a broken jar, facing a tightly locked door Cried out loud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! boom! boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This does not know how many years of experience the door is full of dust and worn marks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on the other side of the gate, it is like a man holding a huge hammer, carrying a huge force and licking the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a heavy voice, and Su Ge looked at the rivets on the hinges of the door and fell off. He hurriedly took a step back with him and looked at the whole body. This mountain gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! boom! boom! ! ! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After three more, the crack of this interpretation finally yielded under the horrible power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a huge door fell, a lot of dust was picked up, and Sug squeezed his cane to release the night bell for detection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, he looks awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dust, out of a body full of blood Thin and thin middle-aged people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
