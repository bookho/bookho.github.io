			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge and Sherry stood steadily behind the dragon's neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the huge head of the dragon was lifted slightly, blocking the cold wind in front of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After two people, there was a small house about 20 square meters that was fixed on the dragon's back in a strange way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug fixed his body, and he saw the ghostly look at the sight, and sighed: "The storm emperor's force is directly affected by this house." Destroyed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hahaha!" Ge Wensi gave a smile and opened the door and said, "Come in and sit, there is no wind inside."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shelly looked at Su Ge with a strange look, with strange eyes in her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge reluctantly grinned, and then two people walked in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The house is very simple, with a bed, a table, and a few chairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the corner of the early room, there are about five huge wine barrels fixed, smelling it, it is snow wine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come here, the last time you invited me to drink, this time I invited you to drink." Ge Wensi warmly greeted the two people to sit down and then handed over Two wine gourds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two were dull and took some heavy wine gourds and sat down, watching Govins pick up a big drink and drink it, then shouted Sit down and sit down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you for this time." Su Ge took a sip and thanked him seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gwens waved his hand: "You're welcome, to be honest, you really surprised me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;He said, he glanced at the glove of Su Ge’s right hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge did not cover up and raised his gloves and smiled: "I generally say that this is done."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl took a sip at this time Then, the white face was slightly rosy: "It tastes good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gwens turned his head a lot of Shirley, with some complicatedities on his face: "It’s coming, after all, it’s coming."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you mean?" Shirley was very uncomfortable with this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gwens looked at the two and took another drink and said, "Don’t trust what you see and your memories. Sometimes, eyes and memories It is the most deceptive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge’s heart was suddenly immersed in contemplation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley's eyebrows are slightly wrinkled: "You said that my memory has a problem?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Ge Wensi is a mysterious smile, not to say more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley did not ask much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is very smart, or is awkward. Although she suddenly fell from the cloud, she has adapted to her identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, she does not have the ability to call this board. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sees it, Gwens is a ruthless person in the true sense, and everything depends on his own preferences. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you anger yourself, you will die, and Su Ge can’t stop it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Say, your body is okay?" Ge Wensi looked at the black blood vessels on Su Ge's face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug shook his head: "Nothing, just a little while."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Drink a big mouthful of wine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are your plans for the next? The Church of the Holy Blood should not let you go," asked Greven. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge said casually: "They all thought that I was dead. After all, I only know a few people who use the potion. This is just the case. I have been in the cage for a long time. I will return to nature. I plan to hide my name in the future. Walk around the world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley heard the plan, his eyes lit up, a small drink, a satisfied face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She also needs a deeper understanding of the world today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gwens nodded: "Good thoughts, the world is changing too fast now, and it’s good to see more."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge laughed happily: "For this plan, I have been planning for more than half a year. Now the church is being taken care of by the late bells, and the church is out of the church in March. I can finally eat and eat." "The luxury life is everywhere."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have so much money? In my impression, you are a poor ghost." Sherry suddenly Said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s heart: “How do you know?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This thing, only Ai Dad knows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley did not answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After paying attention to Su Ge, ask Ge Wensi: "I have a question, I want to ask."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Say." Ge Wensi said casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge calmly said: "Byron dynasty, undead dynasty, war of the gods, who is the first three generations?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gwens sighed: "This is a complicated matter. My memory is not complete. I just feel that there are two complete faults in the whole world."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fault?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to the times, the first nature is our undead dynasty, that There was no mysterious system at the time. We opened up the world with flames and thunder and thundered the dragon. But in the late War Dynasty, after the six kings were slaughtered by %¥#%, the whole world seems to have experienced three nights with only the moon. ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Since it is the night, why are three?" Su Ge asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gwens shook his head: "I don't know very well, just instinctively think. After those three nights, the previous generation of humans all became The undead was buried deep in the lava. At this time, the Byron Empire appeared. Through the Holy Grail of the Soul, he created a soul-centered mysterious spiritual system."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "You are sleeping during this time?" Su Ge asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gwens snorted: "I had a fight with %¥#%, I didn't beat him, and He couldn't kill me. So I passed through the valley." I was suppressed in the center of the world, and then I woke up and slowly climbed out of the center of the world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"World Center!?" Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is a deep and deep underground. My turbid anger is infected at that time. Originally my body was very light and can be windy. OK, chasing thunder and lightning, after all, the name of the storm emperor is not white." Ge Wensi said, and drank a big drink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge licked his eyes and returned to God for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This monk and the god of death have a fight, and the god of death still can't kill him! ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even hundreds of thousands of years after being buried in the lava of the earth, climbed out of the earth! ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gwens continued very casually: "But it is also thanks to him. If it weren’t for these anger, I wouldn’t miss those three nights."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take another sip, with recollections and pity on his face: "But I didn't expect that after I climbed out, he was already dead."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After that, I met you." He looked at Su Ge with serious eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge joked: "You won't find me to seek revenge? Like Ryan."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I and He are not enemies." Ge Wensi said silently: "In ancient times, I could have been able to unite the world with the world, but unfortunately it was exiled by the Six Kings. Oh! It's a pity."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is a pity, but Ge Wensi did not mean the slightest regret, calm and casual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He can kill the six wastes, just let me out, haha."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Suge and Sherry look at each other and don’t know what to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have always been very curious about what happened to the gods of the ancient gods." Su Ge said seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gwens swayed his hand: "I don't know what happened, because when I climbed out of the ground, it was about 5,000 years ago, when the gods had "It's over."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But, I suggest you not to stare at the gods all the time." Gwens said in a positive color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug 愣: "What do you mean?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I told you, the whole There have been faults in the world. In this case, the fault is like a machine restart. The two faults of the whole civilization were cut off, and everything was dying. I have visited many relics and found many different things. It ended the undead, and derived the Byronian dynasty. There should be another fault in an era after the Byronian dynasty. I think that before that fault, people have developed unprecedented levels of disparity."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"An unprecedented degree of surprise? How can this be so awkward?" Su Ge spit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gwenshaha smiled: "It can only be said that when I climbed up from the center of the world, I encountered some deep underground ruins and saw it. A lot of incredible things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For example?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gwens stood up and turned to run Go to the bottom of your bed, touch it for a while, and take out a black thing and throw it over: "It's this stuff."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug took over this black thing suddenly Silly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have seen it!?" Shelly took the lead in noticing the problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge shook hands and picked up the black thing, fiddling with it, whispering: "This thing, called the mobile phone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, Gewens The black thing that comes out is a mobile phone, and it is a mobile phone that is more advanced than the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This phone is made of a special black crystal, very thin and light, with a six-pointed star logo on the bottom and a power button on the edge. Go to the logo and camera. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mobile!! Why haven't I heard this word." Sherry asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gwens is also immersed in meditation, not knowing what to think about. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge whispered: "I have done some weird dreams before, dreaming of a weird world, weird people. They use this kind of thing Contact is similar to writing a letter, but it is much faster than writing a letter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge didn't say too much, or he didn't dare to say too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shelly took a suspicious look, bowed his head and meditated, and continued to drink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can I take this thing away?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gwens sighed: "I have an enchantment in this house, and if you take it out, it will instantly become a soil."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge silently let go, the room was silent, and the topic was deadlocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where are you going?" I don't know how long it took, and Gewens suddenly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge casually said: "Which, anyway, I plan to go out for a walk."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Come here, I want to sleep." Ge Wensi said freely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In silence, the dragon descends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five minutes later, two people were carrying a wine gourd and landed in a deserted mountain range. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
