			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today's Su Ge, you can already see the shape of this moon beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although his spiritual vision is not enough, but since he has seen the moon beast once and has also made contact, the law of the fearless person has expired, after all, he Already know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the price is that the vision has risen by three points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this problem is not big, so that Su Ge’s current horror and spiritual endurance has come to a level of horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next to the altar, Oliver’s body, which was mostly frozen in the whole body, was as white as a dead man, his body shivering, his eyes were devoid of his eyes, and he could not live without seeing it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the moon beast known as the Lord of the Moon and his companions did not save him in the slightest, but watched him let him die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In ten seconds, Oliver stopped breathing. At the same time, a whole body dark, soul-shaped Oliver emerged from the body, blood-red eyes staring at Su Ge low-lying: "I want you to pay the price, the hybrid of the scorpion!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mill saw this brow locked and said: "Be careful, this is the Necromancer One of the high curses: Revenge Evil. This is one of the few curses used by yourself. By cursing yourself, sacrificing your soul after death forms a kind of existence similar to the demon spirit. You can have all the knowledge and memory of your life. It won't dissipate before killing the target."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Su Ge’s mouth showed a smile: "In any case, he is now It’s dead, right?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You can say that, you...” Mill just asked what to do, but he stopped, because he already thought of it. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Su Ge stepped forward and said: "Hey, I am in a good mood now, I am arrogant to teach Vanas, and then kneel on the ground and pray for my forgiveness. I can consider the pain of letting you die!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, the three people suddenly turned black: "Are you too self-righteous?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, Dr. Salo waved and appeared immediately around. A large number of ambush mysterious people and soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long gun in Su Ge’s hand is smooth and swiftly transformed back into the shape of the cane: “The narrow vision limits your thinking, just like the frog at the bottom of the well, thinking that the ignorant thing is both truth. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you know! You don't even know what kind of great work we are doing!" The Duke of the Mountain retorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the moon beast descended from the sky, and the thick legs of the metal armor stepped on the ground, and the tentacles slightly squirmed while making a hoarse voice: "Bug, don't How high is your position, in my opinion, you are no different from those inferior animals."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are people waiting for something here Not anxious to attack, although it seems full of hate, but very restrained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge naturally knows that they are delaying time and want to wait until the coming of the Son of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not in a hurry at this time, after returning from the dream, he found that the power given by his body is temporary, and Su Ge is studying how to make himself Death knowledge is shaped and goes further. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the way, Su Ge was thinking about his own eyes on the son of the great god who had not yet been born. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since it is the son of the death god, there should be a lot of knowledge of ancient deaths, if the baby is absorbed by the authority of death..." Su Ge thought of this sorrow Heartbeat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A baby born in ten hours, Sug knows that it is not a real baby, but a curse and a regular solidified condensate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is called a baby, but in essence it can not be called a creature, Su Ge naturally has no psychological burden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, he is waiting for the birth of the Son of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opposite, seeing Su Ge and others are not in a hurry, these people are naturally not in a hurry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that Hayden is right, they don't know what we plan, and we don't know that the Son of Death is about to be born!" The Duke of the Three Pulses whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other two listened slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After they entered the palace, they naturally found the extremely miserable Hayden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this Hayden is indeed a man. In the face of Master Mill’s torture, he actually survived, and did not say a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to reward him, the Moon Beast personally healed his injury and knew that the other party did not know the core content of their plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think of this, these people suddenly have a well-thought-out mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger said with a silly question: "You have forgotten such a huge setback, what do you want to do?"<br /><br / Dr. Salo said with a wide open voice: "We are exploring the possibility of human evolution. This is a very great cause. We humans have limits, and our form limits us to more." The evolution of advanced life forms, we must be the pioneer of human evolution, the pathfinder, and the path of no one to walk for the whole human being."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oliver Low The hoarse voice said: "You are a self-righteous damn guy! I don't know how noble our vision is. It is stupid to measure our greatness with your shallow and ignorant worldview."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A nonsense!" Lance heard aside, and the voice was filled with anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge still looks at the opposite side calmly: "I have seen people who share the same ideals with you, who sacrificed a city of 40,000 people. Life, summoned the son of Mori's black goat from the stars."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;! ! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, the four people suddenly became shocked: "Sen's Black Goat!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, these madmen know what this title means. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you heard the name, the sound of the moon beast was not calm, and immediately asked: "Where is the place where the ceremony is held!?" /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge does not hide: "It is not far from here, the city of Bain in the Belland Empire, which is my hometown."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have seen that kind of thing actually alive!?" asked Dr. Salo, who had a deep research on the outside god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing his question, Su Ge’s mouth tilted slightly: “Do you know what the end of the ceremony is?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nature is that the entire city is destroyed, and countless ants become servants of the dark sons." The moon beast said indifferently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be seen that it seems to have experienced this before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hehehe..." Su Ge chuckled and didn't go on, but returned to the topic: "You said that human form has limits, then I ask you, do you know where the limits of mankind are?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard this, Dr. Salo immediately replied: "The sage is the limit of human form." It is very sad that our flesh cannot survive the ravages of the years and will die over time. In the past, all people who want to obtain a higher form must abandon the flesh and let the soul be more evolved. Only in this way can we reach a more advanced realm."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"However, the flesh is the dividing line between our soul and the outside world, we lose our flesh, and the soul will follow As time goes by and gradually integrates with the outside world, the more you want to get more knowledge, the more thorough it will be. After the thorough integration with the outside world, we will lose our self-consciousness and become the prisoners and madmen of the rules. This is not true To!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge listened to his heart and said: "Sure enough, as I thought before, if you rashly abandon the soul of evolution, then here is the end, it will only be A chaos."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Inferior creatures, your form has been locked up, and to break through the predicaments of today, let the form of the self be from the flesh Evolving into a more advanced existence, getting rid of human identity is your only choice." The Moon Beast is high above. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge heard it and turned to ask Mill and Lance: "Is this the case?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lance tangled, then nodded: "said It's still a bit reasonable, but please don't be fooled by them!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mill shook his head: "Their ideas are too radical, the big direction is really right." , but there are many ways to avoid that situation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咕咕...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just then, there was a sudden sound of hungry in the black ruler behind these people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a time, all the black breath in the huge pool is like being absorbed by something, and it drops rapidly at a speed visible to the naked eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Become! Become!" Seeing this, the three people are very excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Moon Beast said: "Since it has been successful, it is time to kill this group of insects."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;In a flash, the three people became extremely embarrassed, and they said with pride: "I don't know if we are delaying the birth of the Son of Death?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge smiled slightly: "Of course I know! Since you are ready to be born, you can die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;End, raise your hand Slammed forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, a dark ripple spreads out instantly. At the same time, Randall, Hills and others suddenly sneaked in from the outside world, with the ripples of death, hit the mysterious ambush around. Unprepared, panic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Randall, Lance, and Mil all rushed forward to meet the Duke of the Mountain, Oliver, and Dr. Salo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Moon Beast naturally knows the troubles of Randall’s higher vampire, and the long gun in his hand suddenly emits a glare of light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
