			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gujue’s skill is quite good. Accurately speaking, a successful bard has a good skill, because they need to deal with various kinds when traveling around. Kind of problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, there are many times when the efficiency of hands-on is much higher than the efficiency of the mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the attention of Su Ge, Gu Ju’s three squad and two divided the two clergy and two noble youths, and then the soft tone The two girls said a few words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl was suddenly grateful for her salute, and turned and left quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled and said: "You see, there are a lot of people who like to gossip, not just me."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley did not speak twice and continued to look at the follow-up development. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four people who were placed were not injured, their faces were red, and their expressions were angry. After the ancient sensation, they first screamed loudly, two clergymen. Directly took out the pistol from the arms and pointed at the ancient sense, and his face was gloomy and roaring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ancient sense is very calm, with a calm smile on his lips, and seems to patiently explain something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amber eyes are like two crystal clear gems, with a chic and wise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley suddenly said: "They are not living."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"??" Su Ge heard this and suddenly got a glimpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the two clergymen were ready to shoot, Su Ge took a cane and took a quick step forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he just said, he is also a person who likes to gossip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ancient sense does not seem to feel anything, continue to say something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the crucial moment, a little lazy voice sounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let the gun down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Su Ge, who was just approaching, looked at the sound, a black red-rimmed robe that was very rare, and looked almost 50-year-old. The young people are slowly coming out of the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This middle-aged man is tall, with a Chinese character face, some hair and a beard with a white hair, and some sunken eyes with some worn copper frame glasses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black robe is a strong body, with a one-meter-long, non-sheathed sword that is full of shabby marks. It looks like it is An old swordsman passing by. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing the voice of this priest, the two clerics suddenly turned white and put the pistol down without any hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two aristocratic youths on the side seemed to have seen the savior at this time, and hurriedly bowed to the ceremony: "I have seen Father Sini."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This priest Sini nodded slightly, walked slowly and looked at five people and asked, "What happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This crazy heresy attacked the clergy!" the two clergymen immediately said loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The heresy?" Father Cagne turned to look at the ancient senses and asked: "How do you judge that he is heresy?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He suddenly attacked us, it must be a heresy ready to destroy!" The chunky clergy said calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French Sini has a murky blue eye and looked at the clergyman and asked the ancient saying: "Do you have anything to defend?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ancient sense of tone is not humble, and the sound will slowly tell the story. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ignorance!" Another cleric with a beard shouted loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We just discovered that the two girls have an evil atmosphere on their bodies, wanting to help them hold a baptism, but they are suddenly destroyed, put those two The dangerous girl is let go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gu Jue’s mouth and mouth smirked: “Is the priesthood of the Church of the Holy Blood now shameless to this extent?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The heresy! You heard it!" The two clergymen said loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French Sini licked his ears and did not seem to hear the voices of two clergymen. He looked around and asked, "Who can prove it?" Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time there were twenty or thirty onlookers around, and they did not speak after hearing the priest’s question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are all very familiar people, and they all know what kind of background these four people have. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, dare to play women in the Ten Victory Gate, the forces behind it are not ordinary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four people saw this silence very proud, and the young man with a pale face said seriously: "There is nothing wrong with Father John and Moore, we both It can be proved."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another blond-haired youth went on to say, "Look, the people around have recognized the statements of the two priests."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, a very loud face sounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can confirm this bard's words, I just saw these four guys teasing the two poor girls."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, everyone’s eyes are gathered at the source of the sound, Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ancient look turned around and looked at it, then smiled and expressed gratitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Su Ge prevented accidents and had already done some simple processing on the faces of two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not that the clergy recognizes themselves, simply because they are afraid that the waste of these four sperms will be too much entangled by Sherry’s reasons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge calmly stepped out of the crowd and came to Father Sini, first carrying out a standard March church ceremony: "Hello. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this etiquette, Father Cagnes had some surprises. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this standard salute posture, there are many standards for the salute posture of many young clergymen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This includes the two priests next to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Father Sini had a good impression on Su Ge, and his voice said softly: "Please take this matter from the perspective of the observer. Narrative."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded and said, "My fiancée and I just saw flowers there..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two minutes, Su Ge will tell the story in detail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You lie!" The obese Father John shouted loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge looked at him seriously and asked: "We can swear to the goddess of March at the same time to confirm the authenticity. I dare, do you dare? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, the faces of the two people suddenly paled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world swears to the gods and is not as casual as the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mystery can be seen everywhere, the gods exist, and no cleric dare to swear directly to his faith. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s already obvious that things are here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest of Sini’s standard said: “Thanks to the two heroic gentlemen, I will handle these two clergy, for the two I apologize for the trouble."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ceremony was completed, and Father Sini was slightly cold and said: "The mosque."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two clerics did not seem to be afraid after listening to them. Their eyes stared at Gu Jue and Su Ge, seemingly trying to remember the two people completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The storm quickly subsided under the treatment of Father Sini, the crowd dissipated, and Su Ge smiled and looked at the face of the change: "I envy you." This means."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Gehaha smiled: "Little tricks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To thank you for your help, how about a drink together?" asked Gu Ju. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug turned to look at Shirley and saw that she had no reaction and said: "Exactly, some thirsty."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a very stylish bar near Beth Street, three people sit in the private room on the second floor near the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drinking a liqueur that is not too high, Su Ge recalls the fragrant wheat in his mouth and asks: "You don't seem to be the Belland empire. People."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ancient sensation of the wine in the mouth of the mouth said: "There is no taste, not strong."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, he replied: "Yes, my hometown is far from here, it is not easy to come over."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp He said that he shakes the bottle in his hand and said, "This wine is too tasteless. I have time for you to taste the wine of my hometown. With the sauce beef and peanuts, the taste is really refreshing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing this, Sugerton’s glimpse, because this is not the way Westerners eat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where is your hometown under the circumstance?" Su Ge was a little excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gujue took another sip and said with a smile: "This is not convenient, some sorry."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge set his hand: "Nothing, just curious to ask."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two had a few drinks in their chats. Gu Jue looked at Su Ge and asked: "You should also be a wise man with rich experience. I don't know if you have heard a legend."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Legend? Come and listen." Su Ge asked with interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ancient feelings opened the big book in hand and found a certain page. The sound was right and said: "When people are tainted by filth, the horrible disaster The beast will appear, the beast of the catastrophe will engulf the whole world, and all the filth will push the world to perdition, and all souls will perish in the blood, and all things will die, and the end will come."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
