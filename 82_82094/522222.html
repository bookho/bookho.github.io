			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ps:(This chapter is full of high energy, please watch it carefully!)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the teacher with awe Look, Bart's temptation asks: "Teacher, who is that?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man bowed his head and looked back: "The one is different. The times have different names. Some people call him the Lord of Infinite Glory. Some people call him the omnipotent master. Some people call him the god of time and space."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bad To these names, I felt a scalp tingling, and the whole body shuddered and cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every omnipotence, time and space, these vocabulary are all high-ranking names in all gods, even in myths and legends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now every believer in God claims that his Lord is omnipotent, but no title of God is omnipotent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the name of the god represents its own knowledge, the name is determined by the rules of the world, not by the god itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that is to say, any god from ancient times to the present has not reached the height of omnipotence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for time and space, it is entirely the existence of illusions and theories. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until now, people have never heard of a god who has the power to master time or space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher, is this... true?" Bart asked with a trembling voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man shook his head slightly: "I don't know too well. He seems to be everywhere. It seems that he can appear anywhere in the world anytime, anywhere, even at any time. All myths, all records, all doctrines are completely confusing for his records, upside down, logical errors, and different orders."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is Sotos' relationship?" Bart asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man looked at his most proud student and said: "You know it sooner or later, it’s fine to tell you now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Thank you for your teacher’s guidance.” Bart’s respectful salute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Every god has its own name, but this name cannot be known by me, because the name represents cause and effect and represents becoming a god. The roots and the gloomy past. The gods must be glorious, and everything in the past must be buried."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bar features nod and expresses understanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man continues to say: "The form of the god is different from that of the human being, so the perception is different for people. In general, the gods are malicious to humans. This kind of malice is not subjective, but from instinct."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why is this?" Bart is puzzled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man said: "Have you ever had that kind of experience? When you go to the bathroom to bathe, the flying insects fly in through the window and fly around you, you It's not malicious, but you feel bored, so you raise your hand, slap it and kill it, and continue to take a comfortable bath."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Here, we are the one, and the person who takes a bath is a god."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart bowed his head and didn't know what he was thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But that one is different, He is incompatible with other gods. He likes to be in contact with humans and will often show up and play some games if people can When you finish the game, you can reach a place full of brilliance and dreams through a flashing door. There, people can see the one and get the knowledge of that one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speaking of this, the old man's face with yearning and worship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart looked at the teacher and had some hope in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In rumors, people are able to enter the realm of the Great God because of his gifts. People have hundreds of names for Him, and His Divine power seems to be endless, and even can be called omnipotence. After some unknown reason, the surname of the one person was leaked, and this surname is Sotos."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;! ! ! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart's eyes widened and his face was horrified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The person who first knew the surname died instantly, or was crazy. But as the surname gradually became a concept, the carrier of the horror changed from a few people. It became a whole human being, and this surname is gradually hidden in history. Only a very small number of people know the source of this, and some people only know the extraordinary of this surname, but because of what is extraordinary, they are not clear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That... what about that one?" Bart tempted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man heard this with anger and bitterness: "The surname of that person was leaked, and I don’t know because of his own anger, or because of Some other reasons. He disappeared, and he disappeared with him, and the whole god."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it...he is..." Bart's eyes wide open , seems to think of something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a bang, Lingshi has risen two points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man nodded, his face dignified: "Yes, all kinds of signs and records indicate that it is the entire generation of God that ended, even though it is likely that He will take this world and The astral is completely separated, so that those outside God can not touch the world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart is sluggish, sitting on the ground with some weakness, looking at the bright lights on his head, Half a day is not a god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because that one is too hidden, only a few people who know the truth will worship that person. And those who worship him, you know." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The void family living in the head of the ancient gods."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart is a bit numb, with a dull expression and no fluctuations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Void Remains are ancient residents who live shoulder to shoulder with the undead. Although they are like people, they are not human. They are stronger and more cruel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How do we know about this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man sighed and said: "This is the knowledge that our great Lord has given us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My Lord, know that one?" Bart asked with shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man nodded slightly and wanted to continue to speak. It seemed to think of silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Make these things digested." Finished, turned and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart looked down at the information on the table, and after a long silence, contacted the deputy bishop of the Nighthawk Church, Childe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This nail, they have been quietly nailed in for twenty years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, it’s time to reflect his value. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entering the night, dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss fell asleep and prepared to return to the Kingdom of God to apply for the two witches to follow themselves into the Kingdom of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a dark mist, he accidentally discovered that he did not come to the Kingdom of God, but to a strange world of incomparably dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world can't tell the difference between Southeast and West, everything in the heavens and the earth, everything is dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, in that darkness, Jellos could feel the innumerable tentacles, mouths, scales, squeezing, squirming, splitting, and regenerating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These seem to be one and the same, there seems to be infinite division, infinite engulfing, infinite aggregation, unlimited reproduction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These things that are not called life and individual give a feeling of incomparable evil and horror, just like the darkest and most filthy things in the world are gathered together. Here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concept of darkness and filthiness and normality is different. They look so pure and so clean, except for darkness and filth. There is nothing, purely confusing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Apocalypse hunting? I didn't expect him to be so bored." The incomparably ghostly and seductive voice screamed in the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerousus took out the blazing sword in an instant, and the whole person wore frosty armor, forming the most primitive and powerful form of spiritual madness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a limit to the body, but there is no limit to the spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To fully exploit the power of hunting, it is the right way to go through the spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who?" Gerlos’s voice remained calm, just like the previous hunter who had no feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You did a good job today and didn't humiliate him." The voice came again, and the infinite darkness gradually gathered, forming the temptation and the figure. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one can afford this temptation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at this moment, Gerlos is no longer a human being. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is the apocalyptic apostle of the Lord of the Storm and Death, and the powerful apocalypse is used in his will, so that he can even throw away all feelings and desires for the time being. It becomes more indifferent and more indifferent than the demon hunter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the appearance of this form, Jerouss did not have the same demise as Su Ge, his attitude and heart were extremely calm, and asked indifferently: "Who are you?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shelly with a mask is standing there, faintly visible under her white jade feet full of disgusting tentacles, hooves, Behind it are countless long-horned scary heads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These things don’t have any embarrassment and violent feeling in front of her, like a child who longs for maternal love, praying there, full of respect, fanaticism. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley is not surprised that Jerous is so calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She knows him too well, she knows her relationship with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rhythm of the causality made him very resistant to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he owes his own! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and this man who only inherits his power, because there is no such rhythm, after inheriting his power, you can reach the form of ruthlessness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body came to the front of Gerlos in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss who took on the power of hunter had no resistance in front of her and found that she could not move at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he experienced a lot after all, how much can guess his situation at this time, so he gave up resistance and looked at her calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You seem to have a problem, if it doesn't matter, I will cooperate with you." Gerlos said calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl’s voice said with a slap in the face: “You still know the current affairs. Or, you are very smart.”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My Lord’s vision is not wrong." Gerlos responded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley snorted and looked at his body and asked, "Know why you are looking for you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because I am in this blood." Gerlos directly looked at her eyes and answered directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley gave a slight approval, and the contempt in the depths of the eyes was reduced: "You are not stupid. The Holy Grail of the Soul can be obtained only through some sacrifices." "That's not the Holy Grail."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your ancestor is a monkey, but it is a relatively intelligent monkey, and the Holy Grail is tied to you by an empire. In the blood, the method is very stupid, but the monkey's thinking is already good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of such contempt, Gerlos remained calm and his voice calmed down. The answer: "Do you want my blood?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl said indifferently: "This low blood that is full of filth and curse will only tarnish me. Eyes, you only need to appear in the palace when necessary."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gerlos was silent for a long time, and he tempted to ask: "Are you an enemy or a friend?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark eyes of the mask are a little playful, like a tiger Looking at a mouse in general: "What do you say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Gerlos responded calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, the desire to survive is really strong." Shirley finished, waved, untied the bondage of Gerlos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body is free, and Gerlos vomits a cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just a few answers, he answered yes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the power of the Lord, he is very aware of the horrible power of this owner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kind of inhuman eyes, the high-pitched gesture and tone, the kind of playfulness and casualness that looks at a bug, so that he has just turned the brain Running to the extreme, I am afraid to answer any wrong sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can feel from the first sentence that this horrible existence has a relationship with his own master, which means that she is likely to care The majesty of the Lord is to crush himself like a worm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;here here, Shirley’s body is casually doing it in a tentacle that doesn’t know how big it is, and looking down at it, Jellos asked: “ How long have you been with him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Recent time, about a month." Gerlos answered truthfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley nodded and asked: "How is he?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Unable to answer My master is a true god, and my humble person is not qualified to look directly." Gerlos continued to calmly answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shirley’s eyes flashed a glimmer of light, and the plans in his heart were constantly adjusted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the situation with the black gloves on Sotos' hands?" Xuelier asked again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gilos glimpsed and then shook his head: "I don't know, the clockman is the agent of my master, I am not qualified to ask."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The substitute?哼哼"The face under Shelly's mask showed a sneer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss lowered his head and did not dare to speak without permission. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go back and tell Sotos, let him keep the glove, if there is any mistake, I will immediately find the door." After all the darkness of the room gradually dispersed... ...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Gerlos returned to God, he saw Sug’s face staring at himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a situation!" Gerlos said immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug raises the hand: "Don't move!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss does not move at once, Looking down slightly, I found a monster around my waist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This monster is dark, as if it were a snake, but with eccentric hooves and a sheep's head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time it was wrapped around Gerlos’s body, a pair of black-eyed eyes staring at Gerlos, and the slender body gradually extended a large number of tentacles, at any time Pierced into the spirit of Jerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bell rang, the snake body was like a stimulus, and a screaming screaming, killing Gerlos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next second...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss only felt a weird twist, then the monster was Su Ge held his right hand in his black glove. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This monster gradually melts and then melts into the glove of Su Ge like black oil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug immediately turned around and said, "Wait for me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, quickly turned around Walked into the temple and disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the temple that closed the door again, Jerouss took a sigh of relief and gradually recovered from the form of hunting, and the body was sitting on the ground in an uncontrollable manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that time, it’s been a lot more than the horror that he has experienced in the past 100 years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He never dreamed that he would encounter such a horrible existence one day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the temple, on the throne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge relies on the throne of the grandeur, and the black gloves float in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The look of today's gloves has changed again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The size of the glove has grown longer, before extending only to the wrist, and now it is possible to protect half of the arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The glove seems to be a little thicker. The most important thing is that at the center of the hand, there is a bump in the original place with the snowflake. The bump seems to be a piece of paper. Open the mouth of the sheep's head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The breath of this energy is so familiar, who is it?" Su Ge was frowning at this time, using his own all-spiritual thinking but still thinking do not understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Does this kind of volatility and energy that provokes me have a certain relationship with the previous will?" The brow under the mask of Su Ge is completely locked. I don't understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But one thing is certain, the essence of the glove is the darkness of the child, this thing can be integrated into the glove, and the fusion is so perfect, it also shows the monster and The darkness comes from the same source."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sen's Black Goat!" Su Ge thought of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the next second of the name, Su Ge’s body suddenly trembled, and the body actually had a trembling or vibration, as if instinctively had this name. Special induction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is mad hunting related to Mori's black goat?" Su Ge continued to think. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gods began to think crazy, and even the Su Ge human form memory was infinitely detailed and meticulous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he saw the sound he had heard in his dreams when he was fainted by Ada’s departure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My Lord, we have conquered the end of the abyss, and hoarfrost has frozen all the disgusting guys."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My Lord! Go! Go! This is a trap! This world... This world is... Ah!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Hide up! Hide! The world has no hope of redemption, not even the qualification to be shattered..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My Lord! Go! Go and summon us Exist, find %%##¥%, we still...can..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Su Ge suddenly thought: "The mad hunting is being somehow There is a call to the world, and the purpose is likely to help the existence to accomplish something. But in the end it fails, the hunter army is destroyed, and even the will of the hunter is dissipated, leaving only one The body and a dilapidated battleship hid in the slit of the dream."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is most likely to happen at the end of the gods Things, at that time, the wild hunter army as an outsider encountered a black goat that was invaded by the gods and made some connections."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continue Going forward, he then found the second focus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the time of the Guinness incident, he saw some illusions after hearing the deep integration with the heart and the breath of death, and heard some words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw a huge planet with eyes falling from the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That should be the star of judgment, Gherros, known as the pioneer of destruction."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "After Gherros, it should be the group of invading gods, and the old dominators."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he slowly recalled the memories of the time . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the "unexplained period", once dominated the human dreams, in the past, the dark former dominators came back again, and the world was once again shrouded in distorted dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horrible existence, ordinary people will be crazy when they look at it. A more glance, it will become a sly monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of being overwhelmed by fear. Some people have chosen to surrender, want to survive; some choose crazy, try to forget the fear; more people choose to worship, hope to get knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But me! I can not be reconciled! I want to practice this path of death. I want to reach the root of everything. I want to kill those things that don’t belong to this world! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There should be a human being who practices the path of death. He wants to free the world from the fear of the gods and kill all the gods." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These scenes, ending with a sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My friend who passed away! I swear by the Lord of Wild Hunting that this road will be practiced forever. From then on, I walked with death, with the clock The sound is the same..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When this sounds, Su Ge slowly raises his head and looks at the bell at the top of his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If there is no accident, the person who tries to kill the gods should be the clockman in the depths of the valley. He seems to be the owner of the hunter." Very good, then the god who has mastered the voice and death in the battle. And the same hunter that masters death accepts and blends his knowledge, while accepting, and that one is already in the valley. In the infinite years, the big clock that has been deified."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking about this, Su Ge probably can understand something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The god of the clock is dead, the big clock on his head is the big clock in "The Evening Clock of Glen." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fighting is indeed an outsider, he is summoned by a presence to prevent the invasion of the world by the outside god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fighting in the battle inherited the comrades of the comrades, and the Mori black goats produced an indescribable connection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
