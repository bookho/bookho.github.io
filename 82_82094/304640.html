			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Montgomery, are you not kidding?" Vanas asked with a hint of elegant smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Randall responded with a smile: "Of course, you are an important partner of my husband, and I naturally won't make such an rude joke to you." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, Randall said with a trace of remembrance: "It was almost two hundred years ago, I have lived here for almost thirty years. It was a beautiful place with beautiful scenery. At that time, Mr. Charles was a wise emperor. At that time, Guinness could be said to be the strongest existence of the entire northern countries."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Looking at Randall's appearance, Vanaseton was very surprised: "Two hundred years? And my great-grandfather?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illina looked carefully A: "I see you in your thirties? How can you live for two hundred years?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vignia stared at Randall After hearing it, he later said with a look of disgust: "A corrupt blood smell."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mier interrupted the doubts of two people and said bluntly: "He said Nothing wrong For a higher vampire, two hundred years is just a blink of an eye."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"High...high vampire!?" Hear this, Vanas At the same time, Irina was wide-eyed and shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vignia heard this very unexpectedly, confidently looking at Randall, his eyes glowing: "I was the first time I saw a high vampire." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vampires are a special form. They are not humans, nor belong to the Yi, the monsters, the monsters, the ancient monsters, and they are not in the entire mysterious body. Clear positioning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, scholars have no way to separate this race into new categories, blood-sucking subjects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bloodsucking family includes many, and the blood bats that Suge had previously contacted were one of the blood-sucking subjects, including the bird-headed mosquito, the thirsty blood-beast, and the lower-level vampire. , female vampire, intermediate vampire, and the last high vampire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strength of the vampire is mainly related to age, and the actual combat effectiveness is not favorable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the two most dangerous ones are female vampires and high vampires. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Female vampires can be turned into human figures, afraid of light, afraid of mercury, not flying, physical and healthy, can be invisible, superior strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This vampire was once known as the hunter killer, because the stealth ability was the nightmare of all monster hunters before the invention of silver ash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female vampire is very eager for blood. On average, she can suck the blood of an adult for a week. They can also use the blood of the beast to survive, but human blood is like a drug. The same, as long as you take a meal will be addictive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the female vampire is very aggressive to humans, and can transform the human form, the risk index in the mysterious circle, she is 90 (100 full), is extreme Danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a female vampire, the second is a high vampire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High vampires are all tricky to all mysterious people. Because the higher vampire itself does not belong to the creature, it is itself a cohesive body of mysterious phenomena, belonging to high-level creatures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have lives close to eternal life and cannot be killed anyway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, anyway, even if you burn it to ash, even if there is no residue, he will also be from his other family after one hundred years. The body splits and forms new individuals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the higher vampires are not afraid of the sun, not afraid of mercury, and have almost no weaknesses. They can be turned into black fog, bats flying, can easily convert human beings into their own servants, have super self-healing and strength, can be said to be almost perfect form. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if they are almost out of dependence on blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once a human sage fell in love with a high vampire, in the three hundred years of the sage’s survival, the vampire did not drink a drop of blood, still Live and jump. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Randall smiled and said: "Yes, Her Majesty, this master of the demon hunter is right, I am a high vampire, this year is 573 years old."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas and Elena looked at each other and saw the shock in the other's eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then Elena turned his head and asked Su Ge’s temptation: "Is this what you said?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge put down his legs and said: "Yes, this is the person I said."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is your follower! "Irene asked with a big eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge lifted his chin slightly, with a proud smile on his face: "Okay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Not really, but is. Mr. is our leader, my elder, is our enlightenment." Randall said with a positive face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hearing personally, Elena turned her head and looked at Su Ge, squinting and unable to speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One side of Vanas leaned on the chair, raised his hand to the forehead, and the wide sleeves blocked her look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And behind the sleeves, Vanas reveals a kind of worship like a mad believer, with big red lips and a blushing face, like a sick girl. Yan Yi looks a little scary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;噗嗤! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of some excitement, the laughter did not hold back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "His, what's wrong with you?" Maria hurriedly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas hurriedly said, "Nothing, sneeze, you talk."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Everyone has a moment, after all, the Queen’s ugly state is not something that ordinary people can see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, they didn’t know that Vanas’ eyes were round and wide, and Yan Yi’s smile was wide open. (Refer to Ya'erbide's smile)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if everyone's eyes were placed on Randall, they did not notice the abnormality of Vanas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hills came over here, respectful salute: "Teacher, long time no see."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Randall smiled and nodded: "Look at it, your growth is very fast, and Mr. should be very happy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is satisfied: "Yes, Earlier than I expected."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your will is the will of the Lord, and it cannot be delayed for a while." Randall's answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vignia walked over and said: "Although I hate the corrupt bloody smell on you, you are the leader of the awakened dragon." , then I can also get my respect, not to mention your belief in the existence of one, I believe that He will certainly cure you, blood and blood."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This In the words, Randall’s old fritters are a little bit confusing, turning to look at Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She is not a believer, let Hills tell you." Su Ge directly to Hills. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then Sears whispered, Randall said: "Since it has left the Glorious Church, it is your own."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illina looked at Randall’s respectful attitude towards Su Ge, and he was even more puzzled: “What is the reason for such a powerful vampire to respect this guy with no features? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug turned to introduce Elena and Mill to Randall respectively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After introducing each other's familiarity, Mill's rating on Su Ge has directly improved by at least five grades! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very clear that he is not the opponent of this senior vampire. The state of prosperity is not good, and the current state is even worse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He may have suppressed Su Ge before, but the arrival of this guy has completely subverted the status of both the host and the guest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
