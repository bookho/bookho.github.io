			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ps:Sorry, meeting and going out, just hitting the computer.)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yi When he finished, Su Ge stood up with this rag and walked to a relatively empty place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hands pressed on the cloth, and the vibrations of the night bells passed from the hands of Su Ge into the rags. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rag that was just beginning to darken can still be calm, and it can’t help it as the magnitude and speed of the shock accelerates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After about ten seconds in the past, the black cloth that was squeezed into a group by Su Ge seemed to have a struggle of his own consciousness and seemed to have a dark cloth. The two dry arms stretched out, and the constant swing seemed to be begging for mercy and seemed to be threatening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the cloth broke free from the restraint of Su Ge’s hands and suddenly opened, it looked like a three-meter-long, two-meter-wide irregular Rectangular. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The goddess is on!" Ivan saw this, his eyes widened and looked up, and he was inconceivable and sluggish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rag is black and shiny, it seems to be some kind of black leather, and it seems to be the umbrella surface of the umbrella. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The open rag seems to be a monster with a huge body, claws and claws, and then suddenly slammed down and will completely wrap Sug. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be careful!" Ivan yelled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger is very calm at this time, picking up his cane and gently reaching the rag's cloth: "You better consider it!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the contact with the cane, the rag seems to have been violently scared, just smashed into a group of human-sized cloth from the claws of the teeth and fell to the ground. like a statue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At this time..." Seeing this sudden change, Ivan blinked and couldn't return to God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge stooped and picked it up and said, "I am not malicious to you. If you are honest enough and obedient, I can let you stay with me. Otherwise, the hoarfrost will completely freeze your body." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This rag breaks silent for a few seconds, then stretches out his clothes and nods very humanely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that he has been with Luobo for more than half a year. It has learned a lot of common sense things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Expand your form and fold yourself up," Su Ge said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This rag immediately stretched out of his body, and then he was skillfully folded and finally turned into a very neat black fabric. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this hand holding this black cloth, Su Ge asked: "What is the relationship between the violent witches and you?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The awareness of rags is not high, and when I hear this, I can’t get back to God for a long time, I don’t know what happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, he has very little exposure to the outside world, not to mention this sophisticated intelligence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg didn’t ask much afterwards: “I’m hiding here, just like before.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rag breaks and continues to nod, indicating that. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivan looked at the rag in awe, and asked: "The legendary holy grail document is mutated with the power of the Grail, and the Holy Grail There are hidden connections. Every holy grail file has very different abilities, and can even be said to be very dangerous. So how about putting it here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge smiled: "The problem is not big. This rag is intellectual and conscious. Although it has not been finalized, he seems to be more afraid of death. And it seems to be very friendly to Luobo."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you need to report to the church? This is a big deal after all." Ivan tempted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg thought about it and grinned: "We don't need anything to let the church know. After all, who knows if there are people like Ron in the church?" ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, Ivan flashed a strong vigilance in his eyes and sighed: "Well, after that incident, I secretly left a hand to anyone in the church, just in case."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge patted his shoulder with satisfaction: "Yes, there is progress."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"嘿嘿嘿..." was praised by Su Ge, Ivan scratched his head and smiled happily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How about Evan in this half year?" Su Ge asked suddenly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half a year ago, Evan was the deputy of Ivan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivan smiled and said: "It’s good. He helped me for a month and a half, then went back to school and continued to study. Now he has A well-known genius mechanic, and the steam engine that has been improved with others seems to have received relevant awards."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Joining with others!?" Su Ge eyebrows pick one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the beginning his instructions were already very obvious, and it would be easy to improve with Evan’s talents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivan nodded: "Well, the leader of the improvement is Mike Road. I heard that because this award has been officially nominated by the Steam Association, you can formally join after graduation. Guild."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge frowned and felt that something was wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened to you?" Ivan didn't feel anything unusual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing, oh right! You are ready, I let Anthony inform us about our old friends, have a meal together this evening, by the way, I announced a "Important things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is important?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge mysterious smile: "You will know at night."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the time, Su Ge was relatively leisurely, taking Lobo, who had not seen him for half a year, to walk around, by the way, look at Bain now. The new weather of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Jean set a layer of a relatively high-end restaurant in the name of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a small fee for this kind of restaurant, which costs about 300 francs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Su Ge’s current family, he can’t bear the cost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But with the current status and status of Su Ge, this kind of thing has not been able to spend his money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 7 pm, the invited people arranged their work and then arrived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first to come is Marx and Bobby two night patrols. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This pair of young people now seems to have another layer of relationship, Marx is wearing a decent black suit, Bobby wearing a light pink dress, two people pulling After I stepped in, I looked at the magnificent hall that was ready, and praised: "I really did not read it wrong, Su Ge is really developed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wang ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A barking dog, seeing that Marx’s Lobo’s pace ran lightly and was very close to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past six months or more, Marx has taken care of Lobo more than Ivan. This person has a very good relationship with a dog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two, please show me the invitation." The waiter on the side came over and asked politely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bobby with a lighter makeup from the invitation that Anthony gave them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attendant saw a respectful sideways body: "Please!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second batch The second time is Jack and Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack, who has not seen him for half a year, rarely hangs his big beard today, revealing a straight face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack looked at the splendid shed and sighed: "I remember that I had to eat 10 francs for a meal here. This package should be at least 200 ng. This money is enough for me to collect a set of out-of-print silver Kunte cards."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the side of Roland, he gave him a look: "No wonder you are still single now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland, which has not been seen for half a year, is more mature and beautiful than before, and the temperament is also steady and restrained, Luke For her long-distance teaching seems to be very good, her eyes flashing from time to time to make people feel strange bloody brilliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey! You came very early." After the two people came to the church, including Father Hank, Father Anthony, Marlene Nun, Father Harden, Ivan, etc. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After these people, there are some other people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Including the director of Orson who had taken care of Su Ge, and those who witnessed the birth of Su Ge, and then strictly kept secret or incumbent, or A clergyman who has left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Total together, there are almost thirty people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all the arrivals, the banquet officially begins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This banquet opened relatively freely, and there was no part of the stage of the speech, that is, a group of friends and acquaintances had a meal together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone sat together and talked about the experience of half a year while eating, which is mainly based on Su Ge, and others are more inquiring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard that Su Ge had surrendered to the out-of-control witch with one's own strength, everyone's eyes were unbelievable. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After accidentally hearing that Su Ge’s current deputy is the prince of the Guinness Kingdom, his heart is immediately in the heart of Su Ge’s rights and status in the Guinness Kingdom. Have a new understanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a chat, the wine went through three rounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug is cut into the topic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although Guinness is on the right track, there are not many cores. I believe that the people of the Guinness Kingdom are loyal to the church, but they are cultivated in the short term. Important cadres are not realistic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listening to the people, they all understood and then understood, and then suddenly thought of a possibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge smiled and noticed the change of these people's eyes: "So I applied to the Archbishop, I hope I can transfer a group of skilled backbones from here to help I propped up and took care of the facade of the Guinness Church system."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pump! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear this, everyone suddenly accelerates and beats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is a country, although the area is not large, but after all, it is more than ten times more than the city of Bain! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you pass the bishop’s confession, your position will be rising, and the promotion and salary increase will be just around the corner! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony looked at the people around him, his heart smiled and looked calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivan was so bright and excited at the moment that he finally knew the meaning of Su Ge’s smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge opened his arms and asked: "I want to ask you, who are you willing to come to Guinness to help me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am willing!" Anthony stood up immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am willing!" Ivan excitedly raised his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland seems to have been feeling for a long time: "Let me be one!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father Harden At this time, I was proud and happy: "I said that Su Ge can rise. Laozi has already been fed up with this new idiot bishop."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Follow up and stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mermaine is very good at Su Ge because she converted some of Ada’s memories to Su Ge, and she stood up and said: “Su The character of the grid will not disappoint us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last Marx and Bobby looked at each other and recalled their recent unhappy experience and Rogan’s entrustment. I am also very happy to stand up and express my willingness to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
