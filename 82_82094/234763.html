			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Blood Church, the Bishop's bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ron was sitting in the chair, and his normal eyes had flashed with strange blood. He had just listened to his subordinates’ return and his face was a bit gloomy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside him stood the mayor who was as motionless as Arno. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I really can't think of it, you can actually doubt me," Ron said flatly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In front of him, it was Rogan who was tied to his hands and feet and kneeled on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Rogan’s appearance was not so good, and there were many wounds on his body, which was very miserable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogen looked up at him casually and said: "You can only say that you are too anxious to push Jerous and make him suspicious."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since you know what happened that night, you should be very clear about the gap between you and me. I ask you, why do you want to save Sug?" Ron whispered. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogen smiled and asked: "You should have never heard the bell!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "The bell? What bell?" Ron frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogan is not answering, directly open the topic, whispering to ask: "When did you turn over?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hah, your insight is really keen." Ron chuckled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, Ron stood up and said: "Two years ago, that battle gave me a glimpse of the truth of the world, that is, that year, my spirit. The breakthrough was 85."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You crazy!" Rogan whispered. Ron opened his mouth and said, "I found out that the church's things are deceptive. They say that the character of more than 75 people will be separated from humanity. The form has a huge flip. More than 85 points will go mad and become a monster from the human form."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said with open arms, his expression was very pleasant: "However, I am now 90 points, even looking directly at his existence, I am still in a state of inversion, and did not enter the so-called madman state."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You should thank me, I am the pioneer of your group of blinded people, I have shown you a new path." Ron looked proud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogan sneered: "So you plan to slaughter the people of the entire city as a sacrifice?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "There will be certain sacrifices in the face of exploring the true knowledge. Have you forgotten the people who died in the process of inventing gunpowder, airships, steam engines, firearms? You forgot how many people were when translating ancient sounds into runes Are you crazy? Hey, the death of the ancestors is called sacrifice and sacrifice. When I come to me, it becomes a massacre?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogan coughs with hoarseness The voice retorted: "There are indeed many people who are sacrificing in the process of exploration, but don't forget. The ancestors of sacrifice are remembered because of their courage and senselessness, they sacrificed themselves, not sacrificed. "Others!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you know that I am not sacrificing myself!!!!" Ron suddenly turned and yelled at Rogan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogan closed his eyes and did not argue. The good bishop had already had a huge flip of personality because of the problem of the vision, and this kind of theory is saying Unclear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ron, we have a life of friendship, I hope that you can promise me, don't even bury the clergy in the Holy See." Rogan seems to be dying, Said with powerlessness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ron squatted down and gently supported this former comrade-in-arms, calmly saying: "I can't decide everything. The personnel is close, then I gave it to him for a ruling."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You guy!" Rogan vomited a sip of blood and fainted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Put down, and the group of priests."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!" Father Gail, who lost an arm, whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Turn off all the organs of the church and open all prohibitions. The ultimate law, which has not been used for almost a hundred years, should also play its role."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Yes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A series of instructions, Ron looked at the night sky outside the window and said with a smile: "The night sky will be more beautiful tomorrow night."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will protect your call, but then follow your agreement, and the Holy Grail document that He leads is ours."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the shadow, the middle-aged man still wearing a chef's suit walked out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ron’s head did not return: "Clawson, I am very curious. Why are you joining the cold church as an undead? Even if you join There is no name for the old king, I am not surprised."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This man named Clausen sat down casually: "Coincident, just they took me from the grave I dug it out, so I joined him. Anyway, it doesn't mean anything to live."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So what are your plans? People who are doing things like you have been helping It’s a pity that the ghoul is doing things,” Ron asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clausen waved his hand: "I am doing things steady? Haha, that's because you don't know me very well. My nature is very bad. Why can it? It’s so good to get along with the ghouls, because...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He’s mouth has a strange smile: “I don’t mind eating people.”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; suddenly, the air is a little dignified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, joke. We don’t have different levels of schizophrenia during the long years to deal with the inexhaustible time and difference. Time. What you see is only my superficial personality in this era. Believe me, you don't want to see my nature."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ron does not Continue to continue: "After an hour, the ritual will open. I need you to bring your people to help me to eliminate all the unstable factors."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clausen stood up and said, "Is that interesting little boy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not only him, if it is him, I will not care. He is around There are others who have helped me stabilize that instability. After tomorrow night, we will enter a new world!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dark, a group of people returning in a carriage just returned to Su Ge’s home and took a break. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then all of them apparently felt a violent sensation flashing past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adeline looked up at the window and said with a dignified face: "What is happening."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Luke looked at the front: "The formation, started."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dark, a dark, straight beam of light in the Basilica of the Holy Blood And up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the appearance of this beam, the city is surrounded by sixteen other beams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sixteen beams completely enveloped the entire city, and the mysterious power gradually spread. In the dark night sky, a huge array of pixels that could not be seen by the naked eye gradually formed. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗡嗡嗡...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the sound does not know where it came from, the night People who sleep are walking uncontrollably to the streets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moonlight shimmered, and their stomachs suddenly flashed a strange ash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the moon shadow, you can see that their stomachs are gradually swollen and the structure of the body begins to become distorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole body threw down on the ground and turned into a piece of broken meat that lost its bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hula! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The back of the back suddenly broke through a big hole, a lot of things on the body flashing with countless strange patterns crawled out of the human body, after a few creeps on the ground, turn The head swallowed up the bodies of these poor humans and silently sneaked into the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
