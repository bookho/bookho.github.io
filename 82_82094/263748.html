			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guinness’s border is really small. In the morning, take a horse-drawn carriage and follow the country’s official road for a day. At dusk, the Guinness Metropolis, return to the shadows. The city walls of the city are already far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, it’s not that the seeing is very close, the grooms know the truth of the dead horses in the mountains, so they are about fifteen in the distance to the city. Take a break from the satellite city of Km. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This satellite city called Yumu City is located on the southwest side of the city of Chengcheng. It is one of the three major satellite cities in the capital, mainly producing flax and fish. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Yumu City is built by the river. About one-fifth of the buildings in the city are on the water, so the neat air is relatively humid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have not entered the city, and Su Ge sees the rising smoke in the city in the sunset. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You must be careful about this foreigner. Now it is the Duke of the Mountain, which is occupying the Yumu City. They are here recently to investigate the spies of the Imperial City. Look, a lot of people have been killed!" The groom said pointing to the front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looked down at his fingers, just to see the trunks on both sides of the road, hanging the bodies of many people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people have men and women, old and young, all killed by cruelty, hanging on the neck and hanging on the trunk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at it, there are at least fifty people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The oldest person here seems to be around 50 years old, and the youngest looks like 15 or 6 years old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there evidence for killing these people?" Su Ge turned and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The driver shook his head and sighed: "There is no evidence in this world. I think you are suspicious and kill. I have seen it several times. Some escaped." Because there is too much money, it is considered to be a spy, and it is hung on the tree after killing. Some because of the large number of books, it is also considered to be spies, and counts."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge squeezed his fist: "Do you support the Duke of the Mountain?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The driver was silent, looked around and determined that no one had whispered: "There is a way to do it. Before the Duke of the Mountain was famous for its brutality, but now the royal family and the monster colluded to turn us into sacrifices, we also There is no choice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this to say?" Su Ge brows slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The driver said: "And who else to listen to? This is everywhere the wolf has already explained everything."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear this Su Ge is in silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hurry up! It’s getting dark, we have to get into the city soon!" The driver behind shouted and speeded up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In today's Guinness country, the black sky is a restricted area for humans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger is now on a transportation team, and he has a total of six or seven people on the road, all from the towns along the way. Go to the capital. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a total of seven carriages gradually accelerated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug sat next to the driver and looked at the gates not far away, where there were two checkpoints. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One is to inspect the vehicle, and the other is to check the pedestrian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers on both sides seem to have at least fifty, all armed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, there seemed to be riots on the other side of the city gate. A young man in a gray trench coat was surrounded by a group of people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, the young man waved his hands, and the two flames burst out to burn the soldiers around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mystery? And it seems to be expert?" Su Ge was the first to see such a strong flame ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of this flame is very large, and suddenly the door of the city is messed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stupid mortal! You don't even know what kind of existence is standing in front of you, dare to stop me!?" The young man looks proud and has a strong tone. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers in the distance saw this hurriedly lifting the rifle in their hand and aiming at the shooting against the youth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the young man whispered two sentences and waved his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thick smoke spreads out, not only hides his own form, it seems that there is still some toxin in this smoke, and the soldiers who smelled around suddenly The eyes fainted in the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The mortal mortal dare to block the descendants of the dragon? Who gave you the courage?" The voice of the young man was heard from the smoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the soldiers have no choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗖嗖嗖嗖...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interior of the city gate suddenly flew over a series of dense fire red bullets . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These bullets are very dense, and it seems that dozens of shots have been made in a second. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ignorance! Ordinary bullets really think that we can be mysterious to us..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No When the youth finished, the two huge bodies rushed out of the quickness of the ordinary people and rushed into the smoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! The harsh screams came with a heavy slam. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a dozen seconds, the smoke gradually dissipated. Under the gaze of everyone, people saw two huge steam robots three meters tall in the fog. They have big swords bigger than people in their hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the body of the mysterious man who was just alive can be broken by the bones of these two big swords, the flesh, the bones, the internal organs, and the broken ground. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An expert mystery was killed by two steam robots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pedestrians around are very calm, it seems that all this has become accustomed to. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug, sitting in the carriage, saw the unsuccessful acceleration of this heart beating twice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also saw the steam robot for the first time, and the actual combat power far exceeded Suger's expectations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Quick! Quasi! Hey! Ignore the spirit of attack, high defense, strength, this is simply to deal with the mysterious!" Su Ge was surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The driver on the side snorted: "This is what the so-called mystery is just like this. The legendary blows to them are all going to heaven, what is going on the sea, driving Ghosts are fascinating, and the result is not the same as that of ordinary people! Once a shuttle bullet goes down, it will be gone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled and said: Yes! What mystery is nothing but awkward!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No wonder this world is so mysterious, technology is still so prosperous, over mysterious. From this The robot can see one or two. It is also such a strong technology that the world is still in this steampunk era, without going to the magical world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Near the gate, a few passengers from Su Ge came down and lined up next door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Standing in the team, Su Ge saw the front search very carefully, body, backpack and many other aspects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge sighed with a sigh of relief: "Fortunately! I have a foresight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thoughts already thought Su Ge, who was searching for himself, was on the road, hiding all the equipment on his own in the goods of the trains. The location was absolutely hidden, and Su Ge was not worried about being searched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the turn of Su Ge soon. After a detailed search, the soldiers looked at Su Ge’s identification. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having looked at Su Ge’s thin body and his empty hands, he nodded and let him go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certificate of identity created by the church is specially treated. After seeing it, there will be a hidden psychological suggestion, so that the person who sees the document will not produce Su Ge. What is doubtful and hostile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After passing the gatekeeper's inspection, Su Ge walked into the gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
