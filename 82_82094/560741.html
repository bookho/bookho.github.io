			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the ancient city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jeros, Randall has already met with Jenny and others who are waiting outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now it can be seen, Hills, Sonic, Frost three witches have fully recovered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although they have just witnessed the advent of the dragon, they are totally different from the people in the city, and they are very excited at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s the spokesperson of my Lord!" Several people were shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss already knew about Su Ge’s means. He first returned to God and said, “Suge has already left, and we will leave here as soon as possible.” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How did adults call out my hoarfrost and servants?" Randall suddenly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss smiled: "Nature is the gift of my Lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People It’s all right after listening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, I remember that adults want to go into the city to find something, have you found it?" asked Hills. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerlos nodded and said: "Found."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is it?" Giniya asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss smiled: "You still don't know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, The memory and total elimination of Randall, Hills and others related to the Holy Grail, only Jerouss was spared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss knows very well what he can remember the Holy Grail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't expect the legend to be true." Gerlos sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side, the edge of a city in a certain place in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge's footsteps faltered forward, as Xue Lier said, he was quickly drained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not the kind of physically strong person, although he has been refueling for many years, but he can’t stand it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley standing beside him was very comfortable, clear and refreshed, and even the burgundy on his face retreated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You will not drink in the future." Su Ge said seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, his face was pale, like a noble man with a wine color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley licked the scarlet lips, like a wicked female monk who had just absorbed the male essence: "This depends on your performance." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only exhausted cattle, how can there be cultivated fields?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge I am bitter! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hungry, go eat first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city is in front of you, two people Walk in quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "From the point of view of the humidity of the air, it should be located in the south." Shelly whispered with a hood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two walked on the street, listening to the language around the language: "Fortunately, still in the territory of the Belland Empire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then grab a Langke from his arms and say, "First change the dress, this dress is too conspicuous."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Where did you get so much money?" Shirley had some surprises. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge said faintly: "The Pope of the Church is a king now, my clock holder is above the Pope, you think I will "Lack of money?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, nouveau riche." Shelly said in her mouth, but snatched half of Langke from Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then two people walked into a clothing store that looked relatively high-end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After changing a dress, the two also determined their position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time in the southeastern province of the entire empire, Shanyecheng. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A second-tier city similar to Bain City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half an hour, Su Ge put on a black suit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shelly replaced a dark red lambskin sleeve with a ruffled skirt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Put on a pair of beige flat shoes on both feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a black gauze hat with openwork lace on the head, and the black veil fell to cover her face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hurry to eat!" Under the enthusiasm of the owner, the two quickly came to a restaurant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night, in a relatively upscale hotel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bath in the upscale suite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug is comfortable lying in the bath, very tired, and the body that is falling apart finally got some relaxation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bath is about three meters square and has a large area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the mist of smoke, the beautiful body of white flowers enters the bathroom and sits comfortably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This feeling is really good." The first time in the bath, she was satisfied with the sound of Shirley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the bath, the long, dark hair floats on the surface of the water, like blackening the surface of the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge said with ease: "The benefits of being a man are much more than you think. It is the most boring to become the cold god." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shelley heard the brow furrows and seemed to fall into some memories. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a moment, Emei stretched out and nodded slightly to agree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In her vague memory, the previous combination was more like a group of two different shapes of mud, not only did not have any pleasure, even let She felt bored and bored herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, her heart suddenly disgusted, so I recalled that today these two feelings like floating in the clouds, can not help but more recognized Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug continued: "There are many interesting things to do, eating, drinking, and playing are just one aspect, as well as love, interest, friendship, sense of accomplishment, learning, etc. Etc. These can give us a lot of fun. There are still many things you will learn in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know, I don't need you to teach." Shirley Not happy to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge snorted and said: "Shirley’s childhood is full of misery and darkness, and I have no experience of any human happiness. Being locked up in the ground, after finally coming out, I started planning these things again and didn't enjoy anything at all. Just today, you experienced the thrill of xing love in me. I don't want you to look down on you, you know nothing about the world! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I killed you!" Hearing this, Shirley was like a fierce little tiger, and suddenly rushed over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But was held in his arms by Su Ge, calmly saying: "You can't kill anyone now."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the water, Su Ge was so hugged, and she had a different kind of pleasure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little hand fumbled twice and suddenly pinched something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugton was physically stiff and hurriedly pushed her away, and quickly waved: "No! No! Nutrition can't keep up! Nutrition can't keep up." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shelley revealed a vicious and evil expression like a female demonic: "This can be without you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dream in the Kingdom of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing that Suge and Gerlos met: "Master, do you have any way to keep fit? And, that's it." Is there any secret recipe for kidney? Also, I see you... I see that you and Ms. Adeline have been so loved for so many years, are there any tricks to share?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss was stunned by this question, and then coughed under Su Ge’s serious gaze. He asked: “The nutrition of the body can’t keep up?”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded bitterly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough and cough!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerousus coughed a few more times and whispered: "You are asking the right person. Although I am good at my youth, I can barely surrender to her, but as I get older, my mind is a little different, even though my body is fine."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's what you say, the body is on the one hand, the skills and tricks are also important."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge eyes brighten: " So... can you teach it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss is somewhat uncomfortable: "Is it not too good to say these things in the kingdom of my Lord. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge indulged and asked: "Then I will ask the Lord?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Jerousus hurriedly waved: "Where can this trouble trouble the Lord, so let's go far."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hour later, Su Ge looked at it. Followed by Gerlos, his attitude is full of confidence: "I know "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said, he grinds his teeth: "I see who is begging for mercy this time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "What is begging for mercy?" At this time Vanas's voice came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge coughed one channel: "Nothing, I met an old monster, I can't beat her, so I asked the master of Gerlos to ask about the hunting skills." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas didn't think much, he asked, "Master Gerlos has told me about this, you are doing very well!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a clear smile on Nas's face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled: "I said, I will never give my master the power of the gods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you going to do next?" Vanas asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge stretched his body and said: "Travel around the continent to determine the situation in the world. Now the Holy See thinks that I am dead, all the bondages disappear, nature The sky is high and the bird is flying."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas nodded after listening, then said: "I will give you a new identity through the relationship, and give you another Open a separate bank account and set aside, don't let go of the evening of our late church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge patted his chest and said: "Reassured!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where is the plan, where are you going?" asked Gerlos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug shook his head: "I haven’t been there for a while, I’m busy killing me for a while. I’m going to take a few days off and change my mind, then according to my current hands. The clue goes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The church doesn't have to worry about this, I will handle it well," Vanas said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug said with a smile: "I am completely relieved to see you so confident."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; After a simple negotiation, Vanas returned to his dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She seems to be at some critical moment and needs constant enlightenment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here, Jerouss said something about the Holy Grail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is this kind of thing?" Su Ge stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerlos nodded and said: "The Holy Grail is not a god, but because of its particularity, it can only exist in the present, but not in the past. If there is no special The blood, or to a certain extent, is not qualified to remember the appearance of the Holy Grail."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
