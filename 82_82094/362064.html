			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you dare to move my people to a hair, I will commit suicide immediately, believe me, I have this ability." Stride to the Olympics In front of Lifo, Vanas said loudly and loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Olifo put away the gray gas and said faintly: "Reassure, I am very honest, let's go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, he did not control Vanas, let Vanas follow him and turn around quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Virginia and Hills came to Su Ge and asked, "Are you sure they won't hurt Vanas?"<br />< />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s face nodded confidently: “Reassured, they are a group of madmen who are eager for truth, not the worms of the brain. I am very clear about what they long for. Vanas not only There will be no more things, and you will get a lot of benefits."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hills turned to look at the Imperial City: "I don't know what's going on there." ??<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge sighed: "Since they want to act on a large scale, the Imperial City has collapsed without any accident."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, a vampire servant fell in the sky and immediately said: "Mr. Report, the Imperial City has been captured, and Mil, Elena, Connor and others have successfully withdrawn The Imperial City is gathering here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug is not surprised, nodded slightly and said, "Go and see your master, he should I need your help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attack of the Lord of the Month is very weird, and Randall’s wound seems to heal very slowly. After half a day, he has not recovered. Signs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To search for the gas masks on those people, we can use them for a while." Su Ge told Sears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hills immediately nodded and flew out physically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jean then came with a group of werewolves, respectful, and asked carefully: "Mr. Sotos, what should we do next?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge smiled calmly: "Wait."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Death Breath."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How much can Suge guess the flow of their rituals now, and at the same time that the late bells have evolved, Su Ge The soul is traction, and more or less master the knowledge of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This knowledge of death is critical because it is the introduction that he urgently needs now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afterwards, a group of people returned to the residence of the Duke of Raul and waited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After fifteen minutes, the entire air was covered by the werewolf plague, and a large number of guards and servants became werewolves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the soul effect of Su Ge’s late bell, these people quickly recovered their senses and continued their previous work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Almost at the same time, Mill and others arrived at the reception of two vampire servants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Suge worried that they were infected by the plague, they found that these people were walking in the plague, and there was no problem at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Su Ge was puzzled, he saw a familiar silver figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s still a silver-gray cloth, but with a helmet on the head and a long sword behind it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg recognized Lance at a glance, thinking about his ability to purify the plague of dead bombs before, and it’s no stranger to this situation. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mill and others have suffered more or less, but the problem is not big. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the more weird thing is that Mil’s face was very serious and cold, and it seemed to be a cold, uncharacteristic form of the demon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you." Su Ge looked at Lance seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was some boring voice under the Lance helmet: "Treason and evil, helping others is a code of our own. I have forsaken the principle of being a knight because of the church's orders. Now I want to come."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge heard this sigh: "You are a true knight who deserves respect!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He also took a look at Vegginia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Virginia is so stunned by the bachelor at the moment: "Look at what I am doing, I am not a ghost knight now. But, this holy Although the sword makes it male, it is indeed a few men who have not let me feel disgusted."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lance is very surprised to hear: "Mr. Zhong Zhongren My friend is really amazing. I can see my mysterious career at a glance. It’s amazing! It’s amazing!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Cough!”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg coughed and whispered: "As long as she takes the sword, she will call others a holy sword."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The "..." scene was very embarrassing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the chill, Su Ge asked about Mil and Elena. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The firepower was very fierce, and the plague of the werewolf spread very badly. The left side of the wall was smashed with a gap, and the runes I arranged were not covered by these. The difference in the tactics was all broken." Mill's tone was cold and he coughed twice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irene has just listened to Jean’s story of the whole thing, and her face is impatient: "Sug! You can really be sure that your Majesty will be safe." "What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassured, everything is in my grasp." Su Ge calmed her and asked Mil: "Your situation does not seem too much. Miao."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mill sat down and took a breath and nodded slightly: "I was cursed when I was here to attack the devil. I have been cursing these years. I am eroding my body. The arsenal that I placed in the imperial city is not only a defense, but also a sanctuary to suppress my curse. Now leaving the imperial city, the curse is attacked again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Su Ge can think of some possibilities, and it is not too unexpected: "Are you recovering your feelings because of this curse and the reason of the formation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, I removed most of the power of the demon hunter through the formation, and suppressed the curse. After leaving the squad, the power of the hunter came back, and the curse came back. But the problem is not big, I can still have some fighting power now." Mill explained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lance and Connor on the side said a little after the situation, looking at the people with the mask said: "Come a few people, help me around After dealing with the doors and windows, I can create an isolation space to block the plague."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, Prince Jean was very happy and quickly ordered these nobles to go by themselves. Help Lance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illina is a little confused at this moment, instinctively asking Su Ge: "What should we do next? Do they let them succeed in the evil ceremony?" ?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug squeezed the right hand with black gloves and said calmly: "The real threat is not the Duke of the Mountains and Oliver. The threat is the god of death who has been lurking in this land."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you mean?" Elena asked quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge sneered and explained: "They want to bring the son of the dead god to the material world through the body of the squat, through this child, glimpse more advanced and deep Knowledge. But they are just a group of ignorant people who have never seen a true god. They don't know the horror of true gods!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you seen? Said Elena tempted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hills said: "Of course, Mr. is the apostle who serves my Lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp On the side of the mir, there is no wave of interjection: "Do you intend to use the power of your faith?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Lord of Death and Storm, also the dominator of death, My Lord has the great power to master all the knowledge of death. If the Son of the Great God is born, as long as I use the power of my Lord, I can surrender Him completely. Otherwise, the child’s crying can make the whole city People become crazy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Everything must be prepared for perfection. We don’t know their true progress, even if it is to stop the ritual, we must also ensure that we have the means to stop the Son of the Great God.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear this, everyone has nodded and agreed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next time, it is centered on the residence of the Duke of Raul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the guidance of Jean, the aristocrats gradually mastered the switching methods between humans and werewolves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And for this ability, these nobles are not afraid, but rather very novel and inspiring, because they are very strong in the werewolf form. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He even thought about keeping it like this, not wanting the loss of the werewolf form. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At midnight, the entire city was covered by the plague, and no one was able to escape the residents, the army, the high officials, and the nobility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tens of thousands of werewolves seem to have received some guidance, gathered from all directions to the inner ring, around the imperial city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Randall, who was awakened, ordered his five servants to constantly inspect the situation from the air and report in time through their relationship with the master and servant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At three in the morning, no one is sleepy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sixty-seven people gathered in the hall, waiting quietly, and the atmosphere was dignified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr., the black man in the city's werewolf gradually appeared, and the entire inner zone was almost completely covered. There were also a lot of ghosts." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge stood up here: "You are waiting here, I will go out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp After that, Su Ge took the mask and walked out the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the whole outside is shrouded in a misty black atmosphere, which is very strange, giving a cold and oppressive There is a touch of warmth and heavyness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
