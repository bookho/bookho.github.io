			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The luxury cabin at the top of the cruise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man who was stepped on by Shirley’s face looked gloomy at the six people in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What the hell is going on?" the middle-aged man asked in a low voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first officer shook his head at this moment: "I don't know, we heard a fingertip, and when we returned to God, it was like this."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Boss, that person must be a mystery." The strong man on the side said calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man turned his head and asked: "How come?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was then He was arrested from behind him, but he was suddenly defeated by a force. Now both hands are still numb." The strong man said honestly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear this, middle-aged people are silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a dozen seconds, he said, "Go on, this thing has not happened, don't be discovered by the captain."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then six people left quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man named Pigu Dick, a baron of the Lion Empire, owns his own ocean freight company and is well-known throughout the ocean city. High-ranking characters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pigu is not the owner of this ship, and his wealth has not yet been able to create this storm-class ocean liner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he and the owner of the ship have seen several faces and are considered partners, so they have the opportunity to secretly insert a few of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of his trip to the Berrant Empire this time was to have a meeting with the legendary Admiral. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He needs to help someone to send a batch of less-conforming shipments to the North Wind continent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the goods are not too clean, they can't walk the church's official road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And from the Ocean City to the North Wind continent, without the official road, it is very easy to be attacked by those Viculos pirates and ghost storms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he needs the asylum of the legendary general. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Sherry, on the one hand is his own desire, on the other hand he hopes to give Shirley to the Admiral. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The admiral has not remarried because of his wife’s illness, but according to his intelligence, he still has several hidden lovers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He believes that the appearance of Shelly and the incomparable seductive temperament can definitely win the admiral's favor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't expect to encounter a mysterious person." He squeezed his cane worth 15,000 francs, his face was gloomy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a long time, he decided to ask for his most hidden reliance and the strongman who made himself a family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned to the side of the suite, started the organ, opened a secret door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Iyeta, I met the mystery." Standing at the door, he said with a trace of respect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few seconds later, a woman wearing a light green short robe came out of the room on the inside. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This lady is about forty-five years old, although the appearance is average, but the maintenance is good, the makeup is exquisite, with the mysterious robes on the body, giving a mature, dignified temperament. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iyeta came out and smiled a little: "Is it a mystery? Dear Pigu?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Pigu seriously nodded and said: "Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing his own situation, and his own plan all said a bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iyeta nodded: "A good plan, from your description, should be a mesmerist at least a professional level."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The hypnotist Although Pigu is not very familiar with the mysterious system, he has heard it many times that the hypnotist in the mystery is very dangerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those people can be said to be killing invisible, you don’t know when you were attacked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iyeta calmly said: "There are still six days, don't worry. We should try to avoid extra-budgets this time."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!" Pigu nodded with approval. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows exactly what kind of talent he has. He now has the wealth and status of today, relying on this powerful and mysterious female warlock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, he doesn’t just have a little power, at least he used the whole body solution for so many years, and he comforted the female warlock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iyeta said with a serious face at this time: "You must keep in mind that this mission is very crucial, this material is a great Sofia revival The important core, there must be no mistakes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understand!" Pigu nodded seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very aware of the madness of this intellectually and dignified woman who is on the road to rejuvenation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The eastern continent and the western continent have no place for us. If we want to rehabilitate, we can only live in the inaccessible north wind continent, where we can develop very safely. Long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, Iyeta looked at Pigu and said, "When you are, you will be the founding father, as my husband becomes an empire. Marquis."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard that Pigu’s face was a little excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not pretending. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is only a baron in the Lions Empire. His status is relatively low. He has to look at the faces of the big aristocrats every day. Although he has a lot of wealth, he is very depressed. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a partner, a marquis of a small country. Although the country is smaller, it can be said to be rampant in that country. It is very happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In a small country, it is also a Marquis, and a country formed by a group of female warlocks, the horror energy contained in it is certainly quite horrible." Very clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Female Warlocks, whether in the mysterious world or in the normal society, are elites who stand in the upper and lower levels of various industries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others, this is the woman Iyerta in front of him, not just an expert female warlock, but also proficient in business, politics, nobility Etiquette and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many years his company has been well organized and her profits have doubled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Pigu needs to support the facade outside, and serve her well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pigu sees very clearly, every female warlock is an all-powerful female spy with powerful power. He has seen several female warlocks several times. The underworld organization played with the applause, and finally closed all the underworld organizations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people sat down and talked, Pigu asked: "What happened to Hui Yaocheng?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Iyta nodded slightly: "My sister has been working for a long time. At the banquet two days later, she can take down a finance minister of the Berant Empire, so that we have enough economic base." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Pigu’s heart once again marveled at the horrible penetration of the female warlocks, and the education they have passed down for many years has already touched these arrogant and noble ministers. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These two people..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I first use the magic to determine these two What is the faction of the individual. In addition to me, there are other forces on the ship, and it will be very dangerous to appear rashly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, people are ready." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At nine o'clock in the evening, Hui Yaocheng. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the largest city in the entire Berant Empire, the night of Hui Yao City is naturally not comparable to other small cities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlike the second and third tier cities, Hui Yao City is not allowed to stay up late, but the night of Hui Yao City is very lively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The signs and lights of the major shops in the city are lit up, and the bright street lights on both sides of the road are called a city that never sleeps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not stay up late, does not mean that there is no inspection, even the night inspection is more severe than the day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but those ghostly patrols don’t appear in front of people, but everyone is hidden in the darkness, staring at all the mysterious movements of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, any defenses and inspections have loopholes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hui Yao City is too big, the night watchers are limited, they can only focus on some lively places, and other places can only be swept away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, in some relatively quiet residential areas, the density and intensity of inspections are much lower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, even the March church is not a lot of money to spend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast, the church in March is very short of money, because there are so many places where they need to use money, and many unnecessary expenses are naturally saved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bes Street is a remote location from the center of the city. The three nearby streets are also responsible for only one group of night patrols. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the room of No. 3411, the three sisters were not very good at this time, the dark trees, the street lights flashing from time to time, and occasionally some harsh cats came. Call, let them feel nervous to the extreme. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because they are very clear, since the teacher knows, she will definitely retaliate against them this evening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three people are sitting calmly in the living room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not far away, the mysterious and powerful Miss Bernice sat quietly on the sofa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the coffee table in front of Bernice, there is a simple and delicate incense burner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the smell of very special flue gas floated out of it, gradually spreading throughout the room, causing a faint smog in the entire room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪嗒! Hey! Hey! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the quiet night, there was a sudden drop of water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sound is too far and near, so harsh in the silent night, so scary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three sisters trembled together and looked around with vigilance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, three people felt the air gradually become wet, and then a blurred figure slowly crawled towards this side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Children, it's time to go home." The figure made a horrible voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't come over! Don't come over!" The youngest girl, who was the courageous, suddenly screamed and leaned back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second sister’s eyes are wide, her heart has been overwhelmed by fear, and even all mysterious knowledge has been forgotten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the older sister is reluctantly calm, she does not know how to fight back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their mothers are very accurate, whether from a gift or a mentality, these three sisters are not suitable to become mysterious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The distant bells came from the fog, and led to the lost soul. The glory of my Lord bloomed in the abyss, breaking through despair and spreading hope. Storm-like warships linger in the fog, expelling terrible monsters, pinning on the glory of my Lord, performing justice, eliminating prejudice, and blessing the people, shining the world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the spirit of the three sisters was about to collapse, Bernice’s calm, devout, solemn prayers came out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
