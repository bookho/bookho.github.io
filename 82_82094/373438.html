			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you sure you can withstand the knowledge of existence?" Mill asked after he heard Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s confident answer: “Reassured, my Lord is different from other gods.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;After finishing, turned to the aristocrats piled up at the door: "You can go out, the next thing is unbearable with your vision."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;When I heard this, everyone was relieved and hurriedly turned and went out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mill Master, Randall, Lance stayed, and other people went up." Su Ge took off his hat and took off his black suit. Unbuttoning the button on the neckline of the shirt seems to be a big deal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hills and others followed the nobles to go up and close the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lance asked curiously: "What are you going to do? Although this array is ready-made, we have not prepared enough content and mysterious materials. We I don’t even know the formula of the mysterious material used in conjunction with this array.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge rolled up his right hand sleeve and said: “What mystery material needs for the squad does not know. However, since it is a dreamland, then this thing is definitely the most advanced and effective medium."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, Su Ge’s hands burned incomparably cold The cold flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this ghost thing?" Seeing this cold flame, Lance looked full of vigilance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the nature of this flame, it will succumb to its own water properties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is one of the abilities that my Lord has given me. This flame has the highest level of mysterious coordination and commonality, and the source of this flame itself. There is a certain connection with the dreamland. With this flame as a mysterious medium, it is much better than ordinary materials."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Su The grid extinguished the flame and took out a bottle of shark potion into the mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a time, Su Ge’s spirit could increase again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, this time the triple increase is not based on the psionic power that has increased five times, but on the most primitive psionic power of Su Ge. That is, the psionic power of Su Ge at this time is eight times that under normal circumstances. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, the sacrificial mark of the lake itself is similar to the shark potion, and it is an acquired effect of increasing happiness. The two cannot be perfectly superimposed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the psionic power of your body!?" When drinking the potion, there was a wave of volatility as the psionics grew, and mil felt it. I asked immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, he has lost his feelings at this time, otherwise the expression will be very exciting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the side of Lance looked at the heartbeat: "You just drunk the potion!!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even Randall sees this in his heart full of surprises and curiosity: "What exactly did the Pope do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Su Ge grinned and did not answer: "The first time I felt the taste of the potion was not bad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, turned and strode towards the center of the entire circle . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Slightly step back and help me to fight," Su Ge said loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mill nodded and waved at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dust of the hands of Su Ge black gloves is incomparably fierce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This flame, under the sensation of the massive psionic power of Su Ge, is four meters high and seems to form a huge funnel-shaped horror flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The blue bar has risen eight times, which is really cool." Su Ge looked at the cold flame that was bigger than his own five, and he looked comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the right arm waved and slammed the flame on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whistling...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cold wind spreads out, a lot of flames are like the rain falling into the land, along the dense and complicated lines of the law Infiltrate into it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the entry of the flame, all the lines of the entire array are slowly lit up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a time, the space was filled with dazzling light, and Randall looked at it, thinking that he had entered a different space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The continuous input of the flame, when the lines of the entire space shine to the extreme, the three people only feel a strange space distortion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next blink, everything is back to normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chill was gone, the flames were gone, and Su Ge, who was in the middle of the squad, disappeared, leaving only a silver-white rifle inserted into the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that he succeeded. This rifle is the anchor coordinates he needs when he returns. Then he just needs to wait quietly," Mill said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other side, Su Ge felt that his surroundings were very blurred, and then there was a violent weight loss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he suddenly felt like he was standing on a hard ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open your eyes, Su Ge found himself in a dark space where he couldn’t see his fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where is this?" Su Ge thought in his heart, and suddenly heard a thick and unpleasant gasp in his ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sound is so familiar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Su Ge instantly released the night bell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the reflection and reverberation of the late bell, Su Ge clearly "sees" himself in a narrow and winding cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This cave is about three meters wide and ten meters high, surrounded by solid walls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many caves on the wall, and in the cave Sugg sees the owner of the familiar voice, the ghoul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lot of ghouls here. It looks like there are at least one hundred, almost all of them are small ghouls, and they are suddenly appearing right here. The Su Ge is awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Human, you have come to the wrong place!" There was a deep voice behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The windy claws caught the Suge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of attack is naturally impossible to hit him, only to see the slight side of Su Ge's body, with a few waves of sound waves cutting his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the sound wave blade has no effect and is broken directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Useless, your psionics have no effect on our resistant shells!" The ghoul said proudly, extending his claws to continue attacking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg thought about it, the body slightly retreated to escape the second attack, the left hand suddenly stretched out, and randomly clicked on the ghoul's hard chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Idiot! I..." The ghoul waited, and suddenly the mouth of the big tooth spit out a large blood, and his eyes fell. On the ground, die completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger said faintly: "Your shell can only resist psionic power, but it can't resist the vibration of physical nature."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one that seems to be simple is actually very complicated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first sound of Su Ge’s evening bell acts on the body, and is controlled by the psionic power to gather between the fingers, transforming the psionic sound waves into physical vibrations. Sound waves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afterwards, the fingertips are brought into contact with the skin and passed into the body of the ghoul, which is then controlled by Suge to smash its internal organs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one aspect of Su Ge’s knowledge after entering the expert level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Disposal of this ghoul, Su Ge spread the aftermath of the night bell to a radius of 50 meters, and found the exit when the aftermath was near the limit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then more ghouls climbed out of the cave on the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of these guys, Su Ge didn't want to waste time here, so he took a quick step forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghouls around will naturally not let him go, jump off the cave and attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge snorted, first added a night clock to himself, and the right hand suddenly appeared a lot of horror cold flames, driven by two cold flame elves The next spread quickly spread around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is...what is this ghost thing!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instant, a dozen dodging The ghouls that were not caught were frozen into ice sculptures, and the ghouls who had jumped down had just looked fierce. After feeling the flame, they were scared on their faces, and hurriedly climbed back along the wall to make people look. Inexplicable joy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug, who had already discovered the road ahead, was escorted in the escort of the two Han flame elves. After about a minute, he saw a light-filled exit. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the tide went out, Su Ge found himself in a world that looked very normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at it, the front is a series of towering mountains, green vegetation covering the mountains, the top of the mountain is covered with clouds, looming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On both sides of the cave, there are two steep cliffs with trees and vines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Su Ge’s location seems to be in a valley. The slope in front of it is steep, with strange rocks and only a small amount of vegetation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the hillside is a wide road. The road twists and turns, appears from the fog, and disappears in the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is a bit gloomy at this moment, the air is slightly moist, much like the city of Bain in the early autumn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get out of the cave and step on the hillside. Su Ge snorted in a deep breath and said, "Yes, it is here."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
