			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability shown by the butcher was so shocking to Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a thin body, holding a single knife can actually resist the terrorist attack like a fierce beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shocked thoughts flashed past, and Sug’s right hand with black gloves slammed tightly, and a horrible wave of vibrations emanating from the heart, passed through the arm Su Ge's fist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗡! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, the space around Su Ge’s fist began to tremble violently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A deep breath, Su Ge gas stagnation Dan Tian, ​​the body swings open, using his own voice to resonate with knowledge, the arm is like a physical master, a moment of punch Hit out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, a fist with horror and violent vibrations ignited the air around his fist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air-like cannon that flared like a fist was fired around his fist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High frequency vibration plus severe wind pressure is an explosion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three hunters who were attacking were suddenly hit by this air cannon, the body movements were stiff, one slammed down, and the violent attack rhythm was suddenly interrupted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The violent vibrations in the air caused their bodies to resonate with violent shaking through steel armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But these three are masters after all, they are very powerful in controlling the body. At this time, they only return to normal after two seconds of stiffness and get back control of the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, these two seconds are already critical. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second time waiting for the opportunity to open the second suddenly opened his mouth, spurting a sigh of cold to the three people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three people couldn't hide without seeing it. The first person directly opened his arms and kept his companion behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, the hunter became a cross-shaped ice sculpture that looked crystal clear, like a specimen frozen in ice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spouting this chill, the second time was very wilting, and the body stumbled, as if drinking too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two remaining hunters who focus directly on Erha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I only saw the palms of two people slashing, and then a burst of dark red silk threaded from under the helmet and entangled them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately, Su Ge felt that the physical state of two people entered a new posture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗖! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a dazzling phantom, two people rushed to the second. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key moment is that the butcher has a low drink, the body does not know what kind of reinforcement has been experienced, his body suddenly becomes faster than the average person, actually catching up with the sprint Two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, he grabbed the shoulder of a hunter, and the momentum turned from a string of arrows to a meteorite that was tightly connected to the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temper of the hunter slammed in a sudden stop, as if the monkey was suppressed by the mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are responsible for the other one." The butcher whispered and screamed at the hunter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time another hunter has come to Erha, and the long knife in his hand is waving and stabbing at the head of Erha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speed of Su Ge can't keep up, but the sound can keep up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thick bell rang, and the hunter felt that the ground beneath his feet was squirming like a wave, and the knife was actually stabbed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here Su Ge came up a step, and the sword in his hand stabbed the back of the hunter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Master-level hunters are naturally not stabbed by this awkward attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only seeing his body with a handsome phantom instantly disappeared to the side of Su Ge, stretched out the dirty palms to the thunder and lightning Pinch to Su Ge's neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a bang, the early preparation of Su Ge’s late night was easy to bounce off the hunter’s arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the moment when he attacked the bounced back, Su Ge’s body arched forward, and the right hand of the clenched fist looked very weak and weak. The hunter's steel breastplate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like a small stone slamming on the iron board. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Su Ge calmly recovered his fist and looked at the hunter of the disaster and asked: "What else to say?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Responding to Su Ge is a rapid knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this rapid knife fell to the ground when it was just lifted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because all the internal organs in his body have been shattered, even the spine bone supporting the body has no idea how many knots to break. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body is like a muddy mud on the ground, and after three seconds he slowly closes four eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dangdang! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not far away, the butcher is slashing with the hunter of the hunter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butcher’s fighting ability and physical strength are not said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But due to the limitations of knowledge, he can't guarantee high speed movement and precision while ensuring physical strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So as long as he enters the meteorite state, his mobility will be greatly reduced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point he can only entangle the hunter of the disaster, the most primitive blade cut. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sword of the sword is accompanied by a splash of Mars to make the scene magnificent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butcher over there has noticed the situation of Su Ge at this time, and his heart is secretly surprised and whispered: "Come on help."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded quickly and rushed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next battle was relatively smooth, but the butcher seized the opportunity to directly hold the arms of the hunter, and Su Ge quickly aimed at the fluttering punch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fist went down, the butcher’s ear clearly heard a series of broken bones and the sound of internal organs bursting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This suddenly made his heart jerk and his eyes tightened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very aware of what is going to break the hunter's internal organs and spine bones, which makes him even more surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he has seen the sound wave ability of the master sonic witch, he has a relatively good understanding of the ability of sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he did not think that there are people who use the sound waves so strangely, so cruel, so destructive! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is very calm, after solving the two hunters, he turned and kicked another ice hunter of the hunter, and ran to Lobo. Its situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, Lobo was weak because he consumed too much and was not injured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take the head of Erha, Su Ge smiled and said: "After the time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Erha opened his mouth and licked Su Ge’s face. It seemed to be laughing, and it seemed to be somewhat proud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butcher came over and looked at the magical expression of Erha, and his expression was a bit strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge stood up and said, "Where are we going?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butcher returned to God and turned to look forward and said: "The Archbishop is in the ruins. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge looked up and stood here and could clearly see that at the end of the bridge was a ruin that did not know how many years had passed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ruins are large in size with broken rubble, broken stone pillars, broken statues, broken reliefs...<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The broken wall is full of dust and desolate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The imperial power corresponds to the divine right. The middle road is the core of the occult at that time, the road of the fire sword. Corresponding to the theocracy, it is naturally imperial power, that is to say This is the ruins of the palace of Byron Dias." Su Ge suddenly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mystery originated in philosophy, and at first it was the cognition and discussion of the spirit of the self. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The origin of all philosophy comes from ancient times, even the Byron Empire before the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great scholars at that time divided the spiritual essence of human beings into ten units. Combine these ten units with the fictional world tree of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People want to be great, gain more knowledge, and deep self-identification begins with the first unit "kingdom", to the top, symbolizing The "crown crown" that connects with the universe world advances. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This set of doctrines is not only the source of the entire philosophy, but also the source of occultism. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This set of doctrines is called the "Kabbalah World of Wisdom and Flame." And this road from the kingdom to the crown is called the road of the fire sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The palace symbolizes the kingdom, and the heaven at the top of the church symbolizes the crown." Su Ge said back and forth, muttering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butcher listened to the look: "How do I not know these?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because At the beginning of the three great churches, the source of mystery became Cabatos. Kabbalah simply became a philosophical thought. You don’t learn philosophy, and naturally don’t know.” Su Ge said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butcher said: "Is there still such a statement?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge stepped on the floor and said as he advanced: "The history of the past, the history of the past, The rules of the future are made by the winners. If they don't want you to know, you will never know that this is the winner's right and the embarrassment of the past."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butcher silently followed Su Ge, and retorted after a few seconds: "You don't know what is true, maybe it is also a history modified by the previous winner."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge heard this and looked at it and silenced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butcher is right, who knows if there were other civilizations and worlds before Byron the Great? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That time is too long, no one knows, no one is sure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silence for a long time, Su Ge said: "The letter is there, if you don't believe it, there is nothing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a refutation, and both people can't understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people in silence have crossed the bridge to the ruins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outermost part of the ruins is a circle of completely collapsed walls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This large circle wall completely collapsed into a pile of ruins, and Sugg looked down at the bricks and found that there were many semi-circular gaps on it, as if A huge rope tightened, and then the hard-rooted smashed the general. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interior of the wall ruins has a moat that has been completely dry, and on the inside is the main ruins of the palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire palace seems to have been destroyed by something huge, very scary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are footprints here!" The butcher walked in front and said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug went over and found a big footprint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This should be a monster's foot, two meters long, fifty centimeters wide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
