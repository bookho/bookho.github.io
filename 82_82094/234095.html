			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At midnight, Roland could not sleep in bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aftermath of today’s spiritual growth still exists, she always feels awkward and feels that something bad is about to happen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the apartment, a man in a black robe slowly looked up and his body quietly prepared to sneak into the apartment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But without taking two steps, he suddenly felt a little itchy nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reached out and touched it, and suddenly felt a warm liquid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Blood blood? How is the nosebleed?" The black robe said, and sneaked in at random. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he didn’t take two steps, suddenly coughed, and then a large mouthful of blood spewed out of his mouth uncontrollably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This...this..." The black robes felt bad at this time, and instantly took out a powder and threw it into the air, and they had words in their mouths. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Children, I don't like the goddess of March." The voice of indifference sounded from the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black robe's throat is constantly squirming, but can't speak, as if something has pinched his neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A closer look reveals that it is the blood he spits out on his neck that forms a scary blood hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few seconds later, the black robe fell to the ground and died completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The clergy have fallen to this point. Well, today's three churches have deviated from the original intention of creating the church." A cry, then disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland in the room suddenly felt that he was very sleepy and slept in unconsciously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time is fair, it won't accelerate for anyone who is in a hurry, and it won't slow down for anyone who needs it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time was very smooth in the past, and time soon came to April 17. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This month, Bain City is very calm, the crime rate has been 30% lower than the same period last year, and everyone lives happily and peacefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is full of exhaustion and returns to his chapel with his second son, and finds that it is still clean, and it seems that everyone cleans every day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This month is not so much about learning, it is tempering, or torture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the requirements of the Gaelic officer, this month's focus is on spiritual and willpower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this, Su Ge can only sleep for two hours a day, and the rest of the time is spent in high-intensity study, practice and practice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One month is filled up very much, and Su Ge doesn’t even have the extra energy to think about other things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Painting the grammar, practicing the gun, combating the battle, high-speed singing, spiritual prayer, holy words, etc., each requires a high concentration of talent Execution, otherwise it will be prone to major mistakes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Anthony said yes, after this month, the harvest is really huge." Su Ge whispered in bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pay and return are directly proportional. Although the Gaelic sergeant is not doing a good job, it seems that they are scrupulous, and the thing that teaches Su Ge is really real. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is also a blessing, and Su Ge’s current mental and spiritual power has grown by a factor of two compared to a month ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, his priest has entered the profession, and after the psionic energy is integrated into the knowledge, he can emit a substantial moonlight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These moonlights can increase the amount of weapons, can help people pray, but also purify the pollution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Su Ge also learned two advanced spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special monsters, the sacred words of the Yi people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can increase your weapon and stabilize your spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two skills are very practical, and Su Ge is now fully in control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turned to look at the time, it is two o'clock in the afternoon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Too tired, take a break." Although Su Ge was pressing for time, his tired spirit could not be stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unconsciously, he closed his eyes and slept. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it has been, when he wakes up, he feels someone is calling himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blurry eyes open and find the Gaelic priest who is standing in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing? Also, how did you get in?" Su Ge woke up in an instant and stood up and asked cautiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gail said faintly: "The bishop is looking for you, there are important tasks to give to you, let's go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge turned his head and looked at the time, and found it was already eight o'clock in the evening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sleep for six hours, but it's good, the spirit has recovered somewhat." Su Ge thought of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am a little hungry, eat something in the past, go ahead!" Su Ge said faintly, turned around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gailton was a little annoyed, grabbed Sug and said: "Let's go and hurry! Where is so much nonsense!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, pulling Su Ge goes downstairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge gave a look to Erha, and Erha nodded immediately, and opened a secret door with a spiritual door, and took a backpack. The lattice cane goes downstairs together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the door, three fighting nuns and two gods have been waiting for a long time, calmly watching Su Ge do not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s backpack took a cane and smiled and said, “It’s really grand!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The eyes swept and found that Father Anthony and Mother Marlene were not there. Su Ge sighed. He didn't want these two acquaintances to meet with their own soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moon in the sky is bright, but it can be seen that the purple moon and the moon are getting smaller and smaller, leaving only the blood and the moon growing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day after tomorrow is the bloody month, after the night, the blood will occupy the entire sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pedestrian walked silently on the path, and the atmosphere had an indescribable repression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge took a deep breath, the spirit of the body gradually flowed, he did not intend to see the bishop, then he intends to showdown directly here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey? Su Ge? It’s just that I am looking for you!" Suddenly, a voice came from the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gail frowned and turned to look at it, just to see Rogan smiled and walked over here in the dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few people here who are physically struggling. Gael asks: "What are you doing? The bishop's confidential task is handed over to Su Ge, and no one can delay it." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogen smiled and walked over and said, "I will say a few words, just leave!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Su Ge looked at Ron and asked calmly: "Mr. Rogan, is there anything?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Marx likes dogs very much. Ask where you bought the dog. He also wants to buy one," Rogan said, raising his lamp slightly without a trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smile on Su Ge’s face is even better. The wrist of the cane is slightly turned and said: “This dog is my squat in the wilderness, just in the west of the city. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh! I have time for Marx to try." At this point, Rogan has already reached a distance of one meter from everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
