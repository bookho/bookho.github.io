			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear this, everyone’s face is dignified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sects of the Death Sect and the Institute of Polar Studies exceeded their expectations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug has experienced the last time in Bain City, and has been mentally prepared for this situation, stood up and said: "I just have time, today will After the letter is handed over, I will go to the Duke of the Mountain to see the situation. In the evening, I will go to the north of the city and touch their bottoms."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear this mil nod and say: "This is the best."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since we know the position, can we send the army to the past?" Vanas made a suggestion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge shook his head: "I sent the army in the past, aren't you sending people to the werewolves?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;When I heard this, Vanas thought of the gas in Connor's mouth, and some of his hearts were not reconciled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't we just watch it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mill is somewhat powerless to say:" This is the bad point of a small country. There is no mysterious guarantee of the system. There is no way to do this in extreme situations."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s heart, but no Speak and turn and leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sir, please wait." Connor suddenly made a noise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s mouth tilted slightly and asked, “What’s wrong? Mr. Assassin?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Conner sighed: "You can go out and find a missionary in the ant pub in Central District. You said it was Connor William. The oak axe was introduced to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your last name leads the oak axe? What is this weird name?" Vegginia asked suddenly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hills gave her a blank glance: "The one sentence that follows is obviously the identity of the identity!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Connor continued: "He can give you some help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's the best." Su Ge smiled very happy and sincere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge still quietly left the palace, this time Su Ge did not go directly to Central, but first went to the palace is not far away The residence of the Marquis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis of Raul’s residence, Su Ge, was not the first time he saw it. Just a few days ago, he just caught up with his son’s birthday and was outside the gate. I took a few eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Twin Alliance, a self-proclaimed blood service, is a cult organization that ranks eighth in strength today, according to previous surveys. Although considered to be an extremely dangerous cult However, the style of their work is relatively calm and sleek. They only care about blood. Because they often need to hunt blood all over the world, they are not actively motivated by any force. Of course, the premise is that the people of that power are not Its goal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Twin Alliance is rich in financial resources and is the world's largest blood dealer, not only human blood, magic blood, blood, but even They have all the ancient dragon blood. They even give the local government and the lord enough benefits when necessary to keep the blood hunting behavior legal, so as to maintain long-term cooperation. The rumored Church of the Holy Blood even often goes to the Twin Alliance. Buy some relatively rare blood."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basic information of the Twin Alliance is over, and Suge looks at the Raul House, which is not far away. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "According to the current situation and the distribution of forces, the Twin Alliance is not too hostile to Vanas and should be still on the sidelines. After yesterday's Things, they should know that there is a new force in the Queen's side, so at this moment, they are afraid to rush to shoot."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Su Ge has Bottom, striding forward, said to the guards: "The Her Majesty's Herald, holding the bell, came to visit the Marquis of Raul."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four four armed The guard's eyes sharply looked around Su Ge and seemed to confirm something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few seconds later, a guard said, "Follow me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Follow the guards into the gate, through the wide and beautiful courtyard, into the white castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main entrance hall is a duplex space, one or two floors are connected together, and the walls are decorated with dark gold and red lines of wallpaper, which looks magnificent. Very gorgeous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lobby is large in size and comparable to a large ballroom. At this time there were no murals and attendants who were wiping the walls of the murals and the classical armor that was there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis of Raul seems to have been prepared. When Su Ge first came in, a well-dressed, middle-aged deacon in white gloves came with a smile: "Queen's messenger, please here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go forward about 20 meters from the hallway on the left side of the hall and enter the flash door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge released the aftermath of the evening clock while walking, and saw the surrounding room structure and the people in the room in the aftermath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a big meeting room, at this time three people are already waiting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people all know Sug, Marquis of Raul, Prince Saku, and the glamorous red woman Julie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The people, you are really brave!" Just as soon as he met, Sakko Prince had a gloomy face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge glanced at him, and the contemptuous eyes seemed to be watching a mad dog, and said coldly: "Do you want to go crazy?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You!" Upon hearing this, Prince Sacco was nervous and had some fear in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis of Raul smiled at this moment: "Mr. Messenger, please sit here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge nodded slightly and took the letter out of his arms: "For your banquet tomorrow, Queen Ma said that he is very interested, so he will come here and have face-to-face communication with the ministers."<br />< </br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> I will do my best to welcome the Queen's presence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
