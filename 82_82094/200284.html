			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Completely tidy up your current situation, when Su Ge is preparing to look down, the doorbell suddenly rings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge took a look at his pocket watch and found that it was already one and a half in the afternoon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I watched for five hours!?" Sug remembered sitting down and opening the book at 8:40. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be careful to put this "cheat" on it, and Su Ge quickly went downstairs to open the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doorway Anthony smiled and looked at the look of Sue, who was not quite right. "How is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you give me ten minutes?" Su Ge asked bitterly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony accidentally asked: "Is the body uncomfortable?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, reading a book I haven't eaten yet at lunch, and now I am thirsty and hungry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Anthony looked at Su Ge without a word, and then laughed. : "Go, give you twenty minutes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you! You are a good priest, you can stand by the goddess in the future, get the supreme The glory." Su Ge did not hesitate to praise his own words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Anthony was very comfortable, sitting down and sighing: "Sometimes I still admire you guys who can calm down. I am this person. I can't stand it, you can make me read more than I can kill."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug stood in the kitchen and opened the stove and smiled: "I don't I can't learn, but then come back. I am really interested in mystery, I like mystery."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony is not unexpected, the Soviet Union submitted the information Among them was Su Ge’s first statement to Gerlos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So I envy you!" Anthony did not say this, because it would be too ambition to say so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge took out a bottle of milk from the locker, half cut the baguette, opened the stove and fry the bacon, and wiped the butter and ate the heated milk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty minutes later, Su Ge wiped his mouth and picked up the new and beautiful cane that had changed: "It’s not bad!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people go out side by side, Anthony curiously asks: "When is the hand changing? This texture, this line, should be a silver-plated Nanmu cane? This thing is quite expensive "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled and said: "I bought it for a while, I didn't care very much before. Yesterday I was humiliated because of the cane, so I took it out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony listened and sighed: "Now the quality of the entire empire has yet to be improved, since the release of the Imperial Free Trade Act, the overall The quality has been lowered a lot. And with the increasing differentiation of the class, the contradiction between the civilians and the nobility has gradually increased. Sometimes it is really worrying about the future of the empire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey? Can't see it, you are still a priest who cares about the country and the people!" Su Ge said unexpectedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony smiled and said: "You will be a little psychologically prepared. You...the church..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp When it comes to this, Anthony sinks into it, or whispers: "Don't look at our harmony. There is no difference between the church and the empire of the empire. Bureaucracy is very serious. I heard that the master of Gerlos was as early as four. Ten years ago it was enough to promote the Archbishop, but because Master Gerlos refused to join any faction, they have been suppressed for so many years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge recalls himself Everything I saw and heard on the earth, I spread the hand freely: "I have seen it normal operation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the chat, two people wear After two stone arches, I came to a chapel in the same size as Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is one of the five small chapels that have been reserved for two years and has been used by Ivan as his mysterious workshop." Knock the door before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just knocked on the door, and in less than a second, the door automatically opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So fast?" Su Ge had some surprises. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony mysterious smile: "Don't be scared for a while."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people walked in, Su Ge Heran found that it was not Ivan who opened the door for himself, but a scarecrow made of wood and straw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scarecrow jumped back to the corner after opening the door, leaning against it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge carefully looked at it and found that it was full of complicated spells, and even a lot of complicated metal wires and gemstones with shimmering luster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony said: "This is a by-product of Ivan's mysterious experiment. Is it interesting?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Su Ge nodded, turned and looked at it and suddenly stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because at this time he feels that he has come to the lab of the Magic World. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a circle, the middle three rows of workbench are filled with various beakers, distillation bottles, alcohol lamps, test tubes filled with various color liquids, all kinds of weird The metal pendant, painted half of the circle still on the side, engraved with the iron plate of the rune and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, in the aisle, there are six bamboo brooms that are swinging themselves, sweeping the paper balls thrown away by the owner on the ground into the trash can. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this Quelcelas?" Su Ge couldn't react. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony is very satisfied with Su Ge’s expression, laughing haha: “How? I feel the power of Ivan?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded dullly and immediately asked: "Ivan is also a mystery?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am of course Mystery, or how to study mystery!" A little cautious, with a hint of dissatisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge turned his head and saw Ivan, who was wearing a white coat and full of dark circles, coming down from the second floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony hurriedly explained: "Don't care too much, Ivan is more afraid of life, and is more blunt to strangers, just like it."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he introduced: "Ivan is an expert mysterious inventor. This is a very wide-ranging profession. He has highly sensitive thoughts and spirits and can feel keenly. The mysterious rhythm, and grasp the key to research, discover new knowledge, create new inventions, and at the same time let your creations have mysterious qualifications and activate. Just like the scarecrow and the broom."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge heard the exclamation and said: "It's amazing, amazing! Great!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This side When I heard the face, my face was reddish and my voice was tweaked. "If you praise me any more, I will not be friends with you so soon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Anthony smiled and turned and whispered: "This guy is introverted, always has a mouthful. The more If you refuse, you should praise him more, so that he will accept you soon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge heard it: "It turned out to be an introverted Little cute! This is simple."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After then, Sug sighed and looked at the broom sweeping the floor and sighed: "This is amazing, it is a magical work. Just like the miracle of the goddess, how did you do it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah! That...that..." Ivan’s face is redder, some don’t know The measures were scratched and scratched, and then the whispers explained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge’s face looked like he’s benefited a lot, turned and looked at the reagents on the table and said, “This tastes like silver blood, but it looks better. Beautiful, mysterious concentration is also higher, my God! Compared with this, the silver blood medicine of the church is rubbish!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah! This is this! I just got it..." Ivan said as he walked down and gradually let himself go out of Su Ge’s praise, and he was happy to talk to Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The side of Anthony was shocked to hear that Su Ge was talking non-stop, but there was no repeated praise for the vocabulary, and the whole heart was completely shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
