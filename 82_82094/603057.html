			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the back of Duke’s two people, Marky’s mouth showed a smug smile, looking down at the statue in his hand, and he was not fanatical and mad. Obsessed, more is eager and yearning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What she longs for is not faith, but knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The information she got from some secret magic books, the sleeping god Cruzu, not only mastered the knowledge far beyond ordinary people, but also mastered the world's faults. The essential. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the rumored age, people have been able to leave the world and enter the starry sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was longing for the sight of the starry sky, wanting to enter the sky, wanting to get in touch with those glowing things, want to see what it is. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The great god of sleep, I hope you don't let me down." She slowly grasped the statue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The high priest, is ready, the deep dive has been waiting, is it the first time to sing?" asked a young man with a dark face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Markey nodded slightly: "You can start, I need to put the gods now, and lead the power of the true God through the stars."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is the container?" Marchi asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gloomy youth said: "The problem is not big. His body is sealed by Odin Assin. It is not the kind of fragile seal that can't resist the power of the true God. We feel that the Son of God has been gestated successfully, and only need the corresponding guidance, we can complete the birth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, start the action, in order to reach the source!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In order to reach the source!" the young man said, turned and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a smile on the first floor of Suge’s mouth: “It’s a bit interesting.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;Through the remnants of the idol, Su Ge has heard the conversation between two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Duke calmly walked out with a bodyguard and bowed his head to the first floor of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After seeing the calmness and calmness in Su Ge’s eyes, the tension and fear in Duke’s mind suddenly vanished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because this kind of look can be expressed by just one person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Su Ge’s evaluation of Duke has improved two grades. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;especially the calmness he has just shown and how he handles bodyguards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retracting the line of sight, Su Ge walked into the crowd and said to Drake, who was eloquent: "Sir, can you borrow some time?" /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blause was very annoyed when he was interrupted by Draketon, and his face suddenly froze as he prepared to swear by this rude person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a mask, he couldn’t recognize Su Ge, but he recognized Shelly at a glance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, ladies and gentlemen, please wait a moment, let me deal with the things of my two partners first." Drake said to go to the Soviet Union. In front of the grid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge smiled a little, took Drake and walked to a place not far away, a relatively small place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Assass, is there anything? So eager to call me over?" Drake asked impatiently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge calmly said: "There is now a cult that is preparing to hold an evil ritual, and to treat everyone on the ship as the best."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, suddenly drake Drake's eyes wide open, his face paled: "Mr. Assass, this... what can we do? We are already early Discover, just run away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s eyes stretched out with some disgust and ridicule, calmly said: “Reassured, I have a way to deal with it. And now, I will give you a chance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Opportunity? What opportunity?" Drake calmed down and curiously asked after he heard that Su Ge could handle it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge calmly said: "The opportunity to be a hero."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hero... Opportunity!?" Hearing this, Drake's eyes gradually widened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this moment, his mind fantasies the countless handsome movements and lines, even imagining that after becoming a hero, those beautiful aristocratic ladies cast their arms The stimulating scene after the hug. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg didn’t have time to let him fantasize, calmly said: “I have a plan here that needs your help. If you finish well, I will take the whole event. The credit is given to you, shaping you into a brave hero who defeats the cult and saves everyone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pump! thump! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear this, Drake suddenly has a heartbeat and his breathing is getting heavy. At this time, he didn't even think of any conspiracy and consequences. He asked excitedly: "Mr. Assassin, please say, I have tried my best to help you finish this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge patted his shoulder and looked Satisfied: "Very good, the plan is like this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Su Ge whispered something in his ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dreek heard some fears first, but the temptation to become a hero, the desire for fame and fortune instantly drowned the fear, even rational. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good! Guarantee to complete the task." Drake said forcefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg nodded with satisfaction: "Complete, wait until you reach the Imperial Port, waiting for you will be applause, flowers, girls' voices and reporters' disputes Reported."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, Drake said goodbye to Su Ge in fantasy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you sure he won't be a bad thing?" Shelly asked as she looked at Drake's back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge’s mouth showed a disgusting sneer: “Reassured, he is the kind of person who is unscrupulous for fame and fortune. If there is a chance, he will bite to a crazy fur-skinned dog, and everything that blocks him will be He unscrupulously destroys."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, I have some time to look forward to his self-destruction." Shirley's eyes lit up slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge hugged her shoulder: "Reassure, his destruction must be like a fallen star, and it will be vigorous."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of the combination of Su Ge and Drake, a dozen high-ranking people gathered in the hall, seemingly playing games. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The actress Ms. Mary and the lady in the casino are also among them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people hold a piece of paper in one hand, a pen in one hand, and some weird patterns on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was some strange shape in the food on the table between them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look carefully, as if it were a shape formed by a triangle and a square. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Everyone listens, this is just a game, don't take it seriously." The leader is a young man in a dark blue suit with a swallow mask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After putting the prayer circle, put the pen on it, the tip of the pen points to yourself, and the other side is facing the food in the middle, and your hands are meditation in your heart. Wish, the gods can hear our wishes and fulfill our wishes according to our level of piety!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the youth is talking, a dozen or so around The upper class has already finished painting, and finally the paper is laid flat and the pen is put up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman in the red dress secretly wishes: "I hope that all men can indulge in my charm!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;And Miss Mary, not far from her wishing, is: "I hope to spend a romantic evening with Mr. Assassin, one night."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; With their constant wish, the lights in the entire hall began to flicker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
