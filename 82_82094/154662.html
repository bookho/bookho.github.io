			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ada seems to be a little annoyed at home in the normal homework. She stood up from the seat and looked out the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Listen carefully and you can clearly hear the sound of the outside mess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There seems to be a lot of things today, I hope that Su Ge can be safe." Ada prayed in a pious voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Farm! The farm is on fire!" There was a cry out of the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Farm!?" When I heard this, Ida suddenly became nervous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only because of the problem of the tramp, but also when she left at six o'clock, she told her to investigate the safety of the farm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sug is okay!?" Ada is full of worries in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After thinking for a few seconds, Ada’s face flashed a sternness, took off the white nun’s suit that she had been wearing, and put on the same style of black. Nun service. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she was dressed, she hurried out of the room and rushed to the north of the farm...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp In the shadow of the night, the three night-watchers stood there quietly and seemed to have no intention of shooting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain, don't we really have to help?" Bobby was a little anxious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogan said calmly: "We are not combatants. The more we pay attention to other aspects of the city, the more we cannot The problem caused the messiness of the entire city's defense system."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marx nodded and said: "Bishop Ron has brought people in the past, and this matter should be solved. We still handle our own affairs!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the conversation, the dark crow fell from the sky and stood on Rogan's shoulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surprisingly, however, the crow's head was actually blown up by something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is..." Seeing this, Marx and Bobby were shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogan does not make a sound, the crow faintly said: "Let's go, continue our work."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hang! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the three people just turned around, the violent explosion suddenly sounded...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;North Side The farm was soaking at this time and could not see the situation around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge feels that his whole body has to be broken up, so that he can’t make a force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slightly raised his head, his eyes blurred and saw Hills sitting in front of himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You're fine..." Hills said with a look of exhaustion and fainted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ear creaked, and Sug did not hear the words of Hills, looking at the blurred eyes and found that everyone was stunned by the explosion. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distance is not far from Adeline and Bart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benedicts holding the second ha, about 20 meters from himself, fell on the snow and did not move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking forward, Sug is obsessed with seeing a fleshy body being hard to heal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will become a pale Randall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Make..." Just waiting for him to speak, a powerful fist hit his head and stunned him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black man’s posture is still calm, he holds the green flame skull and comes to Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After carefully scrutinizing Su Ge, the black man’s eyes are full of excitement: “It’s a bit interesting, it’s really interesting. The two witches, and This senior vampire seems to be happy to die for you. Your dog is not ordinary, your cane looks like a dozen forms, your heart is actually a piece of ice, I am really more and more for you. Curious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge heard that his eyes were wide, his heart was extremely shocking, his throat was slightly moving and he made a loud voice: "What the hell are you!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Damn! Is this 88 points of vision? Actually, I can see my body so thoroughly!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black man did not answer, reached out and squeezed Sug The head is ready to pick him up: "This kind of treasured specimen should be well collected."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What to do! What to do? Now in a dream, I have no Any way, is it just taken away by him!?" Su Ge's head turned quickly, but he could not think of any way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this critical moment, the black man seemed to feel something, punching Su Ge in a punch and turning to stare in a certain direction of the dust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sug! Su Ge! Where are you?" The female voice full of worries came from the dust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sug! Su Ge!" The sound is very ordinary, without any mysterious elements, from far to near, gradually clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black man threw down Su Ge and hung the magic book around his waist, holding a green fire skull in his hand, and his eyes were full of dignity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With some messy footsteps, a beautiful figure, dressed in one The weak woman in the black nun's robe came over, her expression was full of worry and anxiety, and she seemed to be looking for something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This person is hearing the explosion and ran over to find Ada of Sug. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ada seems to have sensed something, and suddenly looked up and saw the Su Ge who was fainting around the black man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;噗嗤! Hey! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the moment of seeing this nun, the black man gasps and thickens, his eyes wide open, his calm eyes are full of scary bloodshot, and then quickly congested, The entire eyeball protrudes outward, like an invisible thing that squeezes out of the eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呃呃呃......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very difficult encounter in the throat, like suffocation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the stunned Su Ge, Ada turned his face and said a word with an indescribable indifference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Roll!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black people start to violently shake their body, the body seems to be countless silk Pulling the same, it is extremely difficult to raise your hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a struggling scream, the black man slammed off the mask and stretched out his fingers to directly dig out his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After digging the eyes, the black man pinched his own eyes, and there was some mad whisper in his mouth: "See, I... saw that..." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, he was extremely embarrassed, even if he ignored the stunned Su Ge turned and ran, a gasping room completely disappeared into the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sug! Are you okay!?" After the black man ran, Ada hurriedly ran over and picked up Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After confirming that Su Ge was still alive, Ada looked at her heart and put her forehead on Su Ge’s forehead and whispered, "Little guy, you can't die... ...at least it can't die now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, there was a messy footstep around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jike took a group of people in a hurry and rushed over, looking very ugly after seeing this misery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart’s eye movements, slowly opening, just to see Jike looking at himself with a worried look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The people of the church are coming soon?" Bart said hard, looking around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack nodded: "Bishop Ron seems to have been seriously injured. Most of the clergy are surrounded by Bishop Rogan, but the remaining gods and exorcist are Come here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
