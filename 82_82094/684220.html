			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looked up from the bed and found that time was only four o'clock in the afternoon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Normally, this time should be a good time for the glory of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now the outside is completely dark, like the season of deep winter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When standing at the window and looking at the world outside the window, I feel that the world is a little distorted, or unreal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large number of winds and sands are raging outside, and the whole world seems to have been covered by yellow sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky, the ground, and the buildings are covered with a layer of dust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, this is not an ordinary sandstorm." After a few glances, Su Ge suddenly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking out the window, he felt a special sense of disobedience and unreality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this kind of unreality comes with a kind of truth that can't be said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most direct feeling for Su Ge is the feeling he had when he first came to the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, is the feeling of crossing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shelly calmly said: "The world has begun to change, starting from this sandstorm."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge took a hand and the cane was held in his hand. Looking at the world outside the window, said: "The king of yellow clothes, should have already come to this world?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shelly looked at him and asked: "How do you know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The news that I just got from Vanas, the Brotherhood of the King of the Yellow Emperor has disappeared, and it has become a sacrifice of the first sacrifice. Product." Su Ge said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley listened with a sneer: "The worms should have the worm's death, which is in line with their identity."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge pushed open the window and screamed... A gust of wind blew the wind and sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tingling of the gravel on the face reminds Su Ge that everything is real. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the window from the window, Su Ge found that the world outside has undergone tremendous changes, and he has never seen the buildings on the streets and surrounding buildings. Weird traces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The traces seem to be the scallops of some monsters, and they are also scratches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are even strange weeds and vines on top. The city where the fiber was clean and tidy at the moment seemed to have become an ancient city that had been abandoned for countless years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not only that, but Su Ge also saw a lot of weird monsters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ghoul, Qiuqiu, human face mouse, demon spirit, giant worm larvae, etc. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking up to the sky, the sky has this wing, looks strange, like a dragon flying creature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s Beyaki." Su Ge’s eyes tightened slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The signature servant of Hasa, the king of the Yellow Emperor, needs 42 points to see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes look farther, he sees more monsters, more shadows he can't understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Silently closing the window, Sug patted the dust on his face and clothes, and said calmly: "It seems that we were pulled to the soul The world is over."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world of vision is a mythical theory and legendary world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the mysterious system left by Byron the Great, the vision system based on the fearlessness of the unknown is the umbrella of the protector. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many years, mystical scholars have been exploring what kind of existence of spirituality, and how it distinguishes between humans and the Yi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After countless years of argumentation, people got a conclusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is to have a space, a parallel dimension that coincides with the real world but is different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This dimension accommodates all the Yi people. These Yi people can cross two worlds at will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Yi people enter the human world from the Yi dimension, they will be bound by the spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the dimensions of the Yi, they will always exist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This weird dimension is called the world of vision. Because everything here exists, everything that can be seen on the basis of the spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to this theory, people believe that the world of vision is a derivative world of fantasy, it is not only fully integrated with the real world, but also coincides with the existence of fantasy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in the past few years, the world of vision has only existed in theory and legend, and even many mysterious people do not believe in the existence of this world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many years, even the creators of this theory, as well as his students and future generations, have not used this as a basis to prove how to enter the world of vision and prove whether it is Real existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, at this moment, the scene that Su Ge sees now has a great similarity to the world of vision as described in the book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shelly looked out the window and said, "Do you call it the world of vision?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Su Geyi said: "Is there any other name?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley opened the topic: "The principle of the world and the original ancient city of Acha Basically consistent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge shook his head: "There is still some difference. The world of vision and the normal world are completely coincident, and the boundary between the two Very vague and unclear, with some violent psionic fluctuations, we are likely to break away from this world. After all, it has not belonged to humans since ancient times."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Shirley did not continue this topic, casually said: "You seem to have figured out a lot of things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly and turned to look outside the house: "The battle has quietly approached, I need to go out and determine the current situation, but also test my own situation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley turned and sat On the chair: "Go, I hate the sand very much. It is best not to let me shoot."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge grabbed his clothes and smiled: "Do not worry. I will solve this problem perfectly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Su Ge once again put on the uniform of his late church, the necessary materials and drugs Take them up and walk downstairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Betty downstairs seems to have no feeling of change in the world at all. When he sees Su Ge wearing such a line, he curiously asks: "Adult, what happened?" "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled and asked: "Do you feel that today's wind is big?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Wind? There is no wind today, the sun outside is so big, very warm." Betty blinked and said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s hand touched her head and smiled and said, “Well, that’s good, stay at home.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Betty’s admiration for Su Ge is from the heart, nodding his head, indicating that he must be obedient. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After communicating with Betty, Su Ge did not rush out, he found that the actual situation is very similar to his guess, the boundaries of his existence are very unstable, Betty does not Entering the world of vision can see yourself, which shows that in the real world, your own form still exists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there is a certain risk of going out, he has to go out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of Myra’s business, he must confirm it as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the door, Su Ge looked at it and saw the normal streets, the red sunset, full of warm and popular streets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in a blink of an eye, Su Ge once again returned to the twisted world filled with the Yi and the sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; turned back to the house, and Su Ge sent a message to Duke through hunting, letting his carriage come and send himself to Myra's clinic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In less than ten minutes, a sturdy, luxurious black carriage stopped in front of the apartment, and Suger quickly got on the train with Steven’s, in front of the east . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sitting in the carriage, Su Ge’s eyes swept around, and the normal world and the world of vision continued to flash back and forth in front of him as if he had become Just like a mental illness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the carriage passed a crossroad, Su Ge suddenly heard a shrill scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the lathe, a middle-aged man suddenly fell to the ground, struggling with horror and desperate struggle, as if he had been attacked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a blink of an eye, Sug saw that in that position, a group of ghouls had surrounded the middle-aged man in the middle, madly biting his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the blink of an eye, this middle-aged person has been completely shredded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle, the line of sight cuts back to the real world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under a weird gaze, the middle-aged man’s face was frightened, his body twisted into a strange angle, and his eyes widened desperately at the sky, already No breathing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;St. Stephen sitting opposite Su Ge is not very good at saying: "Adult, I don't know if it is an illusion, I feel that I have heard the violent sand in my ear." Sound, it seems that I saw some monsters in the daytime."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing Stephen’s words, Sug replied: “It’s not an illusion, for some reason, Actually, it is eroding the normal world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Steven is not a mysterious person. Hearing this face, he can't understand Su Ge's words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
