			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At four o'clock in the afternoon, after confirming that nothing went wrong, the two witches left here to return to Bart, and Su Ge had been busy with the day and Ada had just arrived home. Suddenly heard a clear finger in the ear, Aidelin’s voice sounded in the ear: “The people have gathered together and will soon be dreamed and ready.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Su Ge’s heart was shocked, and here he hurriedly said to Ada: “I am a little tired, go to sleep for a while.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then quickly ran back to his bedroom and lay in bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After closing his eyes and passing meditation, Su Ge quickly entered the embarrassing state, in which he was already sitting on the throne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a connection between each other." Su Ge could now feel that there was some special connection between himself and Adeline. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These connections should be the signs left by Adeline on Suge before the mysterious means. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s really God doesn’t know, ghosts don’t know!” Su Ge sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But it’s just right, I can follow this mark, come directly, or send my messenger."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a dark conference room, six people sit together, no one speaks, the atmosphere Very heavy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you mean by this?" The person who spoke on the right side was a little thin and asked with a mask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a representative of the Assassin League, claiming to be a secret hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aideline sneered and said hoarsely: "You don't seem to know the true face of the city yet?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you mean?" Griman asked faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aideline’s finger tapped on the table and made a few crisp knocks saying, “You’re calling the original fire here by default. The existence of a horror feels unpleasant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The existence of horror? Hey, how terrible?" The man with a body-building posture whispered around the mask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the representative of the cold-hearted church, claiming to walk the dog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aideline said faintly: "How terrible? You don't want to know. Let's just say, I only know his code and title. A little more spiritual."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He!?" The other five people heard this and said that the sound line was significantly improved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, it is He. Do you know now?" Adeline faintly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of a sudden, everyone fell silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is generally used to describe sages, gods, units that far exceed human existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can be described by Him is not something that they can reach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bluffs!" With a dark, young man with a little star mask on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the representative of the Institute of Polar Studies, codenamed stars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes! Bluff. Nightingale (Adeline's codename)! The call is coming, I think you want to distract us, take the opportunity to destroy Our previous agreement?" The assassin's secret hand whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question was immediately answered by three other people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grieman, the stars, the hyena also cast their untrustworthy eyes on Adeline. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adelion didn’t take it easy. He turned to look at the young man who was sitting opposite him and kept silent. “What do you think? Count?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This young man carries a mask that looks like nothing, like the face of a dead person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He always has deep depression in his eyes, and everyone can see that he is very unhappy every day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, everyone looks to the count. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because everyone knows that of the six people today, this count is the most terrifying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, he is not interested in robbing the original fire and the Holy Grail documents." Griman sighed in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last time, when they first met, everyone was stunned by the count. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, after hearing the purpose of the count, although everyone did not relax their vigilance, but more or less peace of mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl’s tone is calm and faint: “I’m not interested in what you want, but I’m suddenly interested in the “He” mentioned in the Nightingale.” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the end, the count’s eyes gradually turned into a bright scarlet staring at Adeline. “Since you say that he feels unhappy, then "You have been in contact with Him on your behalf, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aideline shook his head: "I used to have access, but I refused."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl continued to ask: "Since everyone does not believe it, it is very simple. Let us confirm whether He really exists. If it does exist, our actions have caused him. The anger, I believe that everyone who is sitting will not dare to continue."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other four people nodded while listening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even Glyman agrees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And here, the count turned a bit, and the tone was a bit cold: "If you can't make me believe, then I will follow you in accordance with our previous covenant." Handling!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adeline sent out a hoarse laughter like an old sorcerer: "If that's the case, then I'm welcome!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, Adeline’s fingers knocked on the table again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second everyone feels the eyelids sinking, and the surrounding scenery gradually begins to distort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well!" Everyone jumped in their hearts, but at this moment they could not stop the erosion of dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a frightened battle, helplessly closed his eyes and fell into a distorted dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl's calm eyes closed completely without resistance, but instead greeted the dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle, when Glyman opened his eyes again, he found everyone standing in a square in the center of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The damn female warlock! What are you doing!?" was pulled into the dream, and the four people suddenly thundered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Being pulled into a dream by a nightmare warlock is simply looking for death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While talking, four people running psionics want to break through this dream and escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Quiet!" The count suddenly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the count is still there, the four are temporarily calming down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aideline’s faint explanation: “Reassured, I am not interested in your life.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp When talking here, the cold wind suddenly blew in the dark sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this your ghost?" asked the whisper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Adeline’s face also said with a dignified statement: “No.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The wind blows more and more, and the whole space slowly grows like a goose-like snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's so cold!" With Adeline, everyone felt a bit of cold. & Nbsp;; & nbsp; & nbsp; <br <br /> & nbsp /> & nbsp;; & nbsp; & nbsp; wailing hum ...... <br <br /> & nbsp /> winds howl along with even more severe, in six people Under the gaze, six knights wearing silver-gray armor, holding long guns and riding the majestic ghost wolf were faintly in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
