			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking in the streets of Central, Sug took a look at Lance's walking posture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The breathing is well-balanced, the posture is steady, the pace is stable, and the coordination of the whole body is much better than me. He should be the mystery of the faction who walks the body secret." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lance did not notice the weight of Su Ge’s explanation, explaining: “We have agreed on a few secret security points before, we are going to one of them. I hope they are here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why didn't you act with them?" Su Ge asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lance shook his head: "This does not let them know that our Elf Order is also involved."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have a lot of missionaries here, and it is relatively safe to preach here in a neutral position, once and the Holy Grail documents This level of things is related, then the missionary will be very dangerous."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge nodded, his eyes turned, his tone was sincerely reminded "Although your strength field is relatively neutral, I still advise you to leave quickly after you get the Holy Grail documents."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened?" Lance listened It has an unusual taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge explained: "Connor found important clues..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? After listening to Su Ge, Lance was shocked and then gradually became angry: "Are they crazy?? This kind of extinction!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Su Ge quietly looked at Lance's look and praised: "I can feel your anger, I am very pleased. In today's filthy world, like you, the right way, the people who are determined are not much. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lance listened to his face with a serious look: "Our Elf Church, from the communication and cooperation with the elves and fairies. The elves are in this world." The rules are fulfilled, they are sincere and kind. Our sects have vowed to protect them, so our congregation has been observing the Knights’ rules since ancient times and has never violated.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Listening to this serious, awkward discourse, Su Ge recalls Vegniya, who is also a knight, and sighs: "As a knight, your character will make the knights of the Glorious Church unaccompanied."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your compliments and understanding, sir." Lance had a grateful glance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To tell the truth, our knights have been ridiculed by other organizations for a long time. They said that we don't understand the modifications, saying that we are all hypocritical, the Virgin, is Hypocrisy." Speaking of this, Lance's face was a bit lonely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger’s heart was full of emotions, patted him on the shoulder and said seriously: “Don’t care about those ignorant guys who are mentally dark and short-sighted. Stick to your guidelines. It’s good to stick to what you insist on, even if it fails in the end, even if you are laughed at, you will not be confused. You are still you, you have not betrayed yourself.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lance listened to his head and looked up at Su Ge’s eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge stopped, his attitude was serious, his expression said solemnly: "This has nothing to do with winning or losing, only related to his initial commitment."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;噗通! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lance’s heart beats a little, an excitement, an excitement from the heart that fills his entire body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few seconds, he raised his hand on his chest and stepped back and said, "Mr. Zhong Ren, I can meet you today, it’s me. The greatest fortune in twenty-nine years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled and nodded: "Go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; It is a very happy and fulfilling thing to help others get rid of difficulties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After fifteen minutes, Lance took Sug and took a trip to a very popular four-story apartment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The apartment is a condominium apartment, the walls are covered with dust, and the glass is dirty and can't be seen inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a good idea to use dirt as a curtain." After reading it, Su Ge sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lance smiled: "It is good to keep some low-key."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go to the penultimate room on the west side of the third floor along the iron bracket stairs in front. Lance first knocked on the door several times with a hand, and it seemed to be in the right sign. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there was no sound in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not?" Lance is ready to take out the key. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you smell a smell?" Su Ge said suddenly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lance’s nose moved and his face was dark and sullen: “It’s rot.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They were fighting with the Necromancer at the time. You better be careful." Su Ge reminded him and released the aftermath of the night bell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lance nodded solemnly, ready to open the door: "I hope they can hold on."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can't hold on, I'm a little psychologically prepared, and there seem to be a lot of bugs inside, you have to be careful." Su Ge suddenly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lance’s face showed a grief, then his hands spread out on the door, and a burst of blue ripples came from his palm and penetrated into the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Amazing psionic power." Su Ge was amazed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the psionic power of Su Ge is a basin of water, then the spirit of Lance is a big tank! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is the secret of this guy? This spirit can completely exceed the standard, and the genius of Master Gerlos does not have him!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a dozen seconds, Lance spit out a breath: "Thank you for your reminder, the inside has been purified."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After He opened the door and two people walked in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After entering, Suge took a breath of cold air, even if the intensified mentality still made him very uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
