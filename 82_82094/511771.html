			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night, in the dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge, Gerlos, Randall, Hills, Alger, etc. stand in the Kingdom of God and discuss the next plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The big troops are estimated to arrive tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, but they do not intend to move me now, because I still have some value in use. About the secrets of the city. It will leak out at night, and it will be completely messed up at that time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hills has some incomprehensible questions: "The church is not going to strictly enforce confidentiality. "Do you need us to leak it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Randall smiled: "The more things that need to be kept secret, the more likely they are leaked. It is necessary for us to take the shot, and this news can be spread throughout half of the mysterious world overnight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why!?" Hills brows slightly, saying that it can't understanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss said faintly: "Because the three churches also need more people to come here, give them as victims of the path, or sacrifices. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hills heard this suddenly: "The church is really insidious in March."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Suge casually said: "I can't talk about any insidiousness. I have a picture. Today, after I spoke this news, Sapir, Horace and others have experienced intense greed and eagerness in their eyes, so they don't I will let go of this opportunity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss asked: "So, does the church need to be fully revealed?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, we have been squatting for a long enough time, and we have enough savings and confidence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Su Looked at Gerlos and Randall and asked: "What is the realm of the two?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have entered a new era through the knowledge of madness Heaven and earth And practice these days is summed up into a thin lord it paid off. "Jieluo Si said, his face appeared happy and excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has been stuck for decades and is now a little bit worse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Randall followed and nodded: "With the help of hunting, I asked for blood, my body was completely transparent, and I was already exposed to a brand new Form, it is estimated that you can enter the lord level after a while."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's good, this shows that even if we meet the lord now, there are means to save lives. Su Ge nodded with satisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss agreed to nod: "How does the Frost Witch deal with it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is willing to temporarily Become a temporary member to help us support the scene?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerlos nodded and said, "This is no problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, this time The core of our presentation is three words, style, mystery, and power. I expect to prepare four people, two of you, plus the sound waves and the Frost Witch. The four of you represent the church of the late bell."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger listened with a slight exclamation: "There are four masters at a time, and only as an expatriate who is involved, this means is expected to scare many people."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you need Jenny to join in?" Randall asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge indulged: "Is Jenny's knowledge easy to expose her identity?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Randall shook his head. "You don't have to worry about this. Listen to her. After you opened her last time, she entered a state of enlightenment. The whole body's beliefs and mentality made her knowledge happen when she entered the master. Part of the flip."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is, she has changed from a cure to a pastor to a half shadow priest?" Although Suge did not know much, But the head that keeps on sync with the gods is very easy to use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Randall said with amazement: "Your deduction and association skills give me a feeling of inhumanity."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You said it is good, Jenny's knowledge is polluted by a vocabulary you give, causing 60% of knowledge to be flipped."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge’s head turned and instantly thought of his original core sentence: “Your faith has betrayed you.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Yes, is betrayal.” Lan Del said hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In Jenny’s own words, she has changed from a comforter to a traitor. And those who have the opposite knowledge of the cure, she has been hiding ", no use."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge sighed: "If you want to heal, you must know the principles and processes of destruction. This knowledge has a strong double-sided Sexuality, and the opposite is true on both sides. Doctors who are proficient in surgery are likely to become the most sophisticated and hidden murderers. A cleric who is good at healing may also become a fierce wicked person who applies pain."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerousus said at this moment: "The concept of betrayal has already penetrated into her spirit at that time, but it has been missing out of time. This time it was betrayed by Horace. Looking at the companion who left quickly, her spirit has undergone tremendous changes, and it can even be said that the experience is similar to that of Ron. But this flipping is a flip of the worldview and values, not a flip of nature."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"her spirit is now Less stable, they are stable through meditation and their spiritual knowledge, so she did not come. "Randall explain why Jenny did not come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is not worried, nodded and said: "How does the spirit matter? As long as you still serve the Lord faithfully and obey the will of the Lord, then no matter what she becomes, eventually Salvation and peace can be obtained. Randall, tell this to her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes!" Randall said forcefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is in the same color: "I have brought in my car, and Hills has made a uniform uniform belonging to the church of the late bell. There are a total of ten sets. I will let the sound wave bring five sets of past to you. Let Vegniya return to the mysterious person to explore the information and keep it secret. After the beginning of tomorrow, it is the opportunity to let the sound of the night clock clear the mysterious world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understand!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A thick, sacred, solemn bell came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, everyone turned to look at the big clock at the top of the temple. Su Ge said in a wave: "Take this night to death, declare it to the world!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the night, the coalition’s camp was attacked again, and this time it was not the Nighthawk Church but also the camp of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A horrible female knight who wields a big sword instantly wounded three guards, screaming at herself as the embodiment of the Holy Light, and walked away from the camp. A middle-aged nun also snatched a large bag of things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge tracked for half an hour without any effect, and returned without success. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three churches attach great importance to this matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the final result of the investigation, people gradually discovered that the murderer used the Glorious Church’s Holy Light Sword, and even the Psionic Fluctuation is the unique meditation held by the Glorious Church. fluctuation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the armor and sword of the body, although deliberately obscured, but many guards still recognize that it belongs to the Temple of the Glorious Church knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a big cockroach was thrown on Joel’s face, and he couldn’t wipe it clean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And here Su Ge is a very suitable patch, seriously said: "Bishop Joel, I know you and me when you are in Bain City. There have been contradictions, but please come to me if there is anything. Please return the poor nun to me. She is just the ordinary person who came here to help us with laundry."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one has any doubts when he hears this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged nun was very quiet these two days. In addition to preparing food, it was a quiet reading, and there was no physical power in the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shu’s words are very hateful, it can be said that the cockroaches on his face are stuffed into his mouth, this violent stimulation makes Joel’s face Reddish, the whole body trembled violently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Bishop Joel, you are a bit too much." Sarpi said very unpleasantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the basic principles of the mysterious world, the things between the mysterious people, do not involve ordinary people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elf Order’s Bells said seriously: “Bishop Joel, please calm down, let’s have something to say, now the lady is released. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Put! Farting! It’s not our human hand!" Joel was angry and angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this critical period, Moore did not want to make this thing a big deal, turning to see Su Ge asking for meaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly, indicating that he could speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afterwards, Moore analyzes this matter relatively neutrally, including motivation, including changes in the number of people, including related witnesses, etc., which is to make everyone believe in Joel. some. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Joel sent a swearing: "I must find this thing clearly, then smash the murderer and give it to Bishop Sotos. Explain. Otherwise, I will immediately quit the position of the bishop!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a turmoil in Joel’s swearing, patrol patrol, discussion Sleeping, sleeping, angry, angry...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge did not sleep, but in deep meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entering a master from an expert is a huge leap. After this threshold, psionics generally grow three to five times according to the accumulation and qualification of mystery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is a person who is very common in both qualifications and accumulation, so the original psionic power only barely increased by three times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this triple, after the lake's sacred mark is enlarged, it is very scary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the overall psionic power was fifteen, then now, Suge’s psionic power has reached forty-five! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the true sense, it can be said to be massive! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, after the upper limit is increased, the time for full recovery also increases geometrically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Su Ge spent five hours of deep meditation to fill his new psionic energy pool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, on the north side of the cliff, in a very hidden cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vignia put the sound waves and clothes down, and then swinged the big sword, and after removing several parts, the big sword suddenly became a common long sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I took off my coat and revealed the armor inside. I asked, "What should I do next?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss heard this weird name and said with a smile: "It’s hard, and Suge said that you can move freely, do whatever you want, but pay attention to your safety."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vignia listened to grin and then nodded with satisfaction: "That's good, but let's say it, Joel's head must be cut by my own hands." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, her main purpose is to kill Joel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bastard doesn’t know how many women have been harmed, she has already had her list of murders early in the morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he is the real holy sword, and is a master. And when he was only a reserve, it was not Joel’s opponent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when he heard that Joel had offended Su Ge, she immediately seized the opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassured!" Randall said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vignia nodded with a smile and turned and left quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aside, the two old sisters who met again with the sound waves and frost sat together, holding their hands and talking, like two little girls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss opened the parcel and took out five sets of clothes in bags. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open a dress with your own name and look it up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clothes are divided into six parts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hats, outerwear, tops, gloves, pants, leather boots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole set is black with a main color and white lines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This dress is very appetizing, elegant, and exquisite!" Gerlos said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, the body instantly turns into a black mist and gets into the clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tailored clothes appeared on his slender body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The style of the clothes is somewhat similar to the suit, but it is more relaxed and convenient. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The upper body is a long-sleeved dress with a high-neck sleeveless trench coat on the outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The windbreaker is lined with a pale blue, black with a white storm-like texture, very delicate and beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two buttons on the chest, the body is decent, the hem is at the bend of the leg, and there is no obstacle to the movement at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The left chest of the trench coat has the logo of the church of the late bell, and a big gun is inserted into a big gun like a thunderbolt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lower body pants are straight and close to the bottom, and the bottom is the leather soft leather boots that are easy to run and fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black hat is worn on the head, next to the high hat is a pair of crossed gloves, surrounded by exquisite lightning and wind relief, it is Randall As a sign of the Archbishop of the Storm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A pair of soft black gloves were worn on the hand, and suddenly a mysterious and cool, refined and elegant person appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can say that he is a gentleman, you can understand that he is a warrior, but look closely, you will find that he is more like an expert in one aspect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound waves on the side are wide open: "Is this a little too swaying?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Frost murmurs: "This can be said to be the most handsome and best-looking uniform in the world. Is it too much?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I like this dress, it suits me very much." At this moment, one sounded with a low voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two turned their heads and saw that Jenny, who was sitting cross-legged, stood up and his eyes sparkled with strange eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no change in Jenny’s appearance, but the eyes and the overall temperament have undergone earth-shaking changes, and it has become another person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She took the clothes and put a strong breath on her nose and murmured: "I have smelled the blood and saw the corpse of the skin." This dress is the embodiment of the bell, the dress of the apostle of death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerousus then handed the clothes over and asked: "What are the problems with the two? "?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two weather-beaten witches took the clothes and said, "You tell us, is the teaching of the church in the late hour true?" ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerlos nodded: "Of course, Su Ge should have proved our doctrine through her own actions. My lover is a female warlock, now The Pope of the Church is also a witch. Randall is a vampire. The soldiers are werewolves. The facts are in front of me. Are there any hesitations?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "That...the true God you said..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The great Lord is of course, if you join the teaching You have the opportunity to enter the kingdom of our Lord. "Jenny turned slightly, face with a fanatical he said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In her meditation, she figured out a lot of things, and at this time she once again discovered how great the Lord is. Even if it is the servant of the Lord, a word of the Zhongren, a word can give himself such a huge help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, she feels that her own true self is released, just like the shackles that I applied to myself from childhood, all broke open and entered a free world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two witches can be said to have witnessed Jenny’s flipping, and there are still some concerns in mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But what shocked them at this time was that even if Jenny had turned over, she was still absolutely loyal and still had true true feelings for her own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Randall smiled and reached out to sort out Jenny’s messy hair. This woman was very appetizing for him. When she saved her at that time, through the eyes of her eyes, he discovered that she was hidden in the depths of her soul. The power of the, and the violent and dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, this power was completely released, and it actually made him feel in his heart. He feels that Jenny is so charming now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By Randall combing his hair, Jenny turned back and looked a little red, whispered: "I will change clothes first, can you help me?" ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course no problem." Speaking, Randall took Jenny to another relatively independent cave on the inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss looked at the two witches and asked: "Is there any doubts or concerns?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Blatantly sheltering witches, this will make your organization hostile to many forces." Sonic calm analysis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerousus did not care to explain: "There are a lot of inaccuracies here. As early as a long time ago, the Green Flame Brotherhood knew about the behavior of our sheltered witches, and even Actively helping Hills and Bernice to create a new identity. Many of the clerics in Bain City know this, and even many people know it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is this possible!" Frost said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is normal to accept the Green Flame Brotherhood as a cult organization, how can the clergy and the public know and accept it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss explained: "My Lord is the true god now. He came to the world in the great events of Bain City and shattered the black of Sen. The conspiracy of the coming of the goats, many people at that time witnessed the gods and infinite power of my Lord and became the faithful believers of my Lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;! ! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this legendary news, the two people couldn’t help but open their eyes and said it was incredible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition, the power of my Lord healed Hills and Bernice. You two should be able to feel that the shape of Hills is very different from yours. That is the result of taking over the power of my master. This power eliminates the possibility that the witch is out of control, and turns the parasite sarcoma of your chest from a bomb into a source of pure power."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people kept blinking and felt that their heads were not enough for this series of news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Witches, female warlocks, vampires, undead people, werewolves are the targets of our shelter. You should think about it, I am going to change clothes." Gerlos said Take your own clothes and walk inwardly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just walked in, just to see Randall and Jenny are kissing together like two snakes, Jenny’s church uniform is half off Half worn, full body ruddy, blurred eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss turned around helplessly, bowing his head and coughing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people who are confused and fascinated suddenly reacted, Jenny’s face A red crimson, hurriedly finishing wearing half of the clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Randall, who has lived for more than 500 years, has already practiced a ancestral cheeky worth 500 years. At this time, he loved Jenny again. One bit, facing Gerlos: "I will be right away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Five minutes later, Jenny's attitude has returned to normal, and Randall went out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss unloaded his gear and replaced it with a decent uniform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His clothes are more luxurious than Randall, with a lot of white frost-like lines on the sleeves and chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top-of-the-line logo has also become a full-blown frost, with a large sword inserted in the skull of the ice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This dress is estimated to be still in the testing phase, with no extra place to put things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss looked at his traps, wire, arrows, bombs, etc. After a moment of silence, he gave up these things completely and only picked up the potion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a process of choice and growth. If you want to enter a new realm, you must abandon all the constraints of the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has found his own direction of knowledge after entering the lord, which he no longer needs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of these things, he can mimic similar things by mastering the hoarfrost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"White Cream..." Gerlos raised his hand and looked at the white particles in the middle of his palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White Cream is a special ability that Su Ge gave him. The hoarfrost does not only represent absolute cold, but also represents an activity that he can not understand until now. And unspeakable horror energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, hoarfrost has top-class shaping and mysterious conductivity, which is like a liquid metal that can be arbitrarily shaped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The way to break this desperate rule is in it." Gerlos squeezed his palms, and the golden erect was full of firmness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the outside, the sound waves and frost have been negotiated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We can temporarily join and repay your kindness to us, but let us suddenly believe so much, we can't do it. We have experienced it for many years. Many times of deception and betrayal." Frost said seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss nodded and didn’t say much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The church has now taken shape, and the entire card and system need to be strictly confidential. It cannot be brought into the kingdom of God as if it were pulled before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"First change the clothes, then prepare. There are four hours from dawn, there is plenty of time to prepare and meditate."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people took their clothes and went inside to change clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After changing clothes, the five people discussed the next plan, then closed their eyes and prepared for tomorrow's blockbuster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun rises, the morning fog gradually dissipates in the sun, The beautiful green hills appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weather is very good today, the sun is shining, and there is no cloud, which seems to indicate that there are any good things coming up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
