After so many, I can feel Her Majesty's devotion to the goddess, I don't think any problem can be a hindrance to the return of the goddess of the Guinness Kingdom."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emilia nodded slightly: "You said Yes, Deputy Archbishop Sotos, I have been doing my best to promote this exciting thing, and that is why I came overnight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge then turned to Vanas and said, "Your Majesty the Queen, you should be able to feel the compassion and sincerity of our Archbishop. As the most faithful believer of the goddess, no one in the church can think of the purity and piety of the Archbishop. The Archbishop has sacrificed a lot for this matter, even in the church. The slanders and hostility of many polluters. I think that in this matter, what are the two steps back from each other? After all, we are all descendants of the goddess."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;When I heard this, Vanas indulged, and the correct answer: "I have already learned the difficulties and sacrifices of the Archbishop from Mr. Sotos. I can see that you are very concerned about Mr. Sotos, I I also recognize Mr. Sotos’s piety and kindness to the goddess. If you really have difficulties, we will try our best to help you in the future.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, she paused and said with a profound meaning: "You don't want to have some gaps and gaps between you and me in the future?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Milia applauded and looked at Su Ge and said with a smile: "I can feel the sincerity of Her Majesty. If this is the case, I will take a step back. The archbishop Sotos can become the regional bishop here, but I I hope that you can help Mr. Sotos with all his strength and not to have some unnecessary . Title "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;". This is your peace of mind, we will, "Wa Nasi said seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about this, the three people suddenly laughed at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then, there will be a lot of things going on." The two stood up at the same time, Emilia said and said awkwardly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas looked relaxed: "I am used to it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three people separated, Su Ge was in a wheelchair and continued to recover, Vanas began to officially announce The Kingdom of Guinness officially accepted the asylum of the Church of the Holy Blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Emilia began to launch her own horrible resources to operate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the small meeting room of the aircraft, four people sat here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leading is Emilia, followed by Suger’s two-faced Bishop Kirien, and the other two are the strong female guards and one It looks very ordinary glasses man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These four people are Emilia’s absolute confidant and her most trustworthy person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Archbishop, do you think this is really appropriate?" asked Kirian's dignified temptation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emilia is indifferent, using the unique ethereal voice: "The background of Su Ge is absolutely clean, he is also very smart, knowing to actively seek me." Guinness has always been the heart of the whole church. As long as I hold them firmly in my hands, the old people who don’t die will not continue to make irresponsible remarks to me. With the foundation of the northeastern province, the status will be completely consolidated. Down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She did not tell Suge’s identity as a bell, some secrets must be controlled by her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people heard nod and the strong female guard asked: "Is the Archbishop, giving Guinness such a high degree of autonomy is it too indulgent? If they and Su The face is united to engage in a conspiracy, or to control Su Ge into their jealousy, then we will lose all control over them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Emily Sub-micron nodded: "I have considered this matter, so this is why it is so urgent to establish the Cathedral of the Holy Blood here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you... "What four thoughts suddenly." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emeria's eyelids sagged slightly, her hands folded on her chest, her face said piously: "No one can resist the power of the blood of the ancient gods, no one ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the four people listened, they let go of their hearts. The young woman in the glasses said with ease: "In this case, the entire Guinness Kingdom is included in the hands, and the northeastern provinces are united to see those who are still dead and dare to marry in front of the Archbishop. ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, fellow citizens." At this moment, Emilia stood up and her arms opened slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For the March goddess, we must save enough power to free the church from the current corruption and filth. Now let us take the first step ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For the March Goddess!" The others followed and stood up and shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other side, Su Ge and Vanas once again determined their progress and determined that they would continue without any problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good play, officially started." Su Ge was lying on the bed, looking at the moonlight outside the window, his mouth showing a confident smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next week, the Guinness Kingdom is completely boiling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the news, there are hundreds of ambassadors appointed by the Queen, and the Church of the Holy Blood, which continues to appear in the Guinness country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of these people were transferred from Bain City. As a sincere expression, they helped people in war to repair their homes, drive out beasts, and restore farmland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People who were still very resistant to this kind of refuge after accepting this tangible benefit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people do not care who is in power, who is the belief, as long as they can let themselves eat and wear warm, they do not care about other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the situation in the Kingdom of Guinness quickly spread to the world through the powerful advocacy of the official and Holy Blood Church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, the Archbishop of Emilia, who first opened the church for the first time in many years, naturally became the absolute protagonist of this incident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know! Damn!" Julie, who was still on the way to the plateau, heard the news and looked gloomy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mask man smiled and said: "The problem is not big. Do you see the regional bishop above? Su Ge Sotos. In the future, I think there is still a lot of cooperation between us."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Julie heard this slight nod and looked at Su Ge’s name in thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side, in an office of the Imperial City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart's coffee with a blend of milkshakes and milk smelled, and the look of the face, pick up today's newspaper to see the news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fighting! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coffee that just entered the mouth suddenly sprang up. Had to put the cup down, Bart took the glasses and looked at the reports in the newspaper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is reported that the Archbishop of Emilia has activated a bishop of a newcomer, Su Ge Sotos, who served as the regional bishop of Guinness. According to the investigation, Suger Sotos was born in Bain City. After joining the church, he repeatedly made great achievements. His intelligence destroyed the death sect and destroyed the evil ritual of the Green Flame Brotherhood. In addition, this time in Guinness In the recovery battle, the Queen of Guinness was protected by death. Vanas Guinness was not only favored by the Queen, but also recognized by the church. Archbishop Emilia, Archbishop Gerlos’s devout faith. The good nature is highly valued..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this, Bart’s eyes quickly moved a few times before he slowly turned back and said, "This It shouldn't be the same name! How long has it been before, seems to be more than half a year?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bellant Empire City, Byron City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a high-end apartment in the Cangyue District of Ducheng, Bernice took a silk scarf and wiped his mouth gently, reaching out his white hand and picking up the maid. A newspaper handed over, the beautiful green eyes swept slightly, and the eyes suddenly lit up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss, Viscount William invites you to have dinner at the Wiener Hotel this evening. Are you free today?" The maid on the side took the plate and asked . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bennis arranged the light blue silk dress to stand up and put the napkin down and said, "Turn off all the entertainment, I will go to the teacher today." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Miss."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other side, a secret private club. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adeline, who just got up, put silver-gray earrings on her ear, and Geros’s rough hand lying beside her touched her back. Expressionlessly said: "The words that told me to tell you to Su Ge through dreams, and now he has become a bishop, after the teaching of Emilia, can understand these things."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wearing black openwork, black and smooth sling stockings, Adeline asked: "Are you late?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Gerlos answered and said: "It’s not too late, Emilia will not tell him all about it. It’s only a year and a half away from the new round of witch hunting. Since he decided to shelter the witch, he must Know the truth in this holy blood maze."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you sure these things will allow him to restore your emotions?" Adeline turned and hugged him full Scarred body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerousus Guru has no wave to answer: "The Church of the Holy Blood has completely disappointed me. If he can really restore my emotions, I can follow you." Join the church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I like your determination." Gerlos listened to her again and unhealthyly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dead, there is no end..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Southeast side of the mainland, known as the whole The Empire was the first to see the sunrise of the Rising Sun City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, this kid." Luke sat on the chair in the street, looking at the newspaper with his legs crossed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crowson, who is with him, said: "I don’t care about the gods, but the most recent kind of erratic wave is from Guinness. Come here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, it should be the fluctuations related to the Great God, but it has been completely cut off, and it is estimated that it was disposed of by him."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luke said with a sip of coffee: "How is the tracing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
