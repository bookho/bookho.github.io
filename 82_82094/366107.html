			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this black fog, Su Ge feels like a beautiful woman who falls in love at first sight, and the heart is thumping and accelerating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the heart beats, the wheezing becomes violent and heavy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course this is not to say that Suger suddenly has some unspeakable reactions. It can be seen that in this intense breathing, a large amount of death breath is inhaled by Su Ge from the nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is this guy doing? As a priest, he inhales such a strong breath of death is to find death!" Elena stood behind the glass, through the mist I can barely see the state of Su Ge at this time in the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The side of the mil coughed and held the window sill carefully, saying: "His faith is not the goddess of March, his faith seems to have very The powerful authority to die, he should now be sacrificed through some special methods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lance shook his head after listening: "That won't work." In order to have a direct connection with faith, we must use a strong enough spirit and psionic power. His psionic power is too small, and there is not enough quantity to form a stable base."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reassure, the wisdom of the gentleman is not something you can consider." Randall’s seat smirked behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, there are two fist-sized large holes in his chest, and the surrounding tissues are squirming, trying to repair the injured tissue, which gives the surrounding The nobility looked pale and frightened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug feels that his body is better than ever, and is more comfortable than ever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This breath of death seems to him to be the same as the long dry land, into the body and become a silent energy gathered in his heart. Nearby, nourish his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This strange heart has not been highlighted by me since it was passed through, but it does not show any special effects. The guy itself is not something that belongs to the world!” Su Ge’s mouth is big, his eyes are bright and his expression is excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After being exposed to these dead breaths, Su Ge felt that the heart was like a beast that woke up from a deep sleep, and began to madly absorb the lingering breath of the surrounding world through his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the constant inhalation of the breath of death, a large number of cold tentacles began to spread around the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ice heart at the moment is like a big tree, madly extending its roots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And these roots must follow the blood vessels, bones, and nerves of Su Ge's body and want to completely root in this body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s like the seeds have gained enough nutrients and they are finally sprouting and growing." Su Ge thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The process feels very, very bad, the kind of parasitic feeling that is slowly stuffed with blood vessels, bones, body, and even some people collapse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Su Ge is not worried at all, because he is very clear, that is his heart, the physical body of this "Sug Sotos" The core link between the gods and the bodies in the dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some rude unbuttoned clothes, holding a handful of secret props, Su Ge took his upper body and stepped into the depths of the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking down at your body, the heart beats very much, and the skin on the left chest is regularly undulating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Su Ge is like taking a potion. All the blood vessels in his hands, body, nose, face and forehead are bulging and become black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It looks very embarrassing at the moment, even giving people a tree root that grows under the skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This heart, this body, seems to be evolving under the influence of the breath of death." Su Ge saw some doorways. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spit a cold, cold, a kind of instinct that is transmitted from the heart to the brain of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Suger held a cane in his left hand, holding the frost skull in his right hand with black leather gloves, stretching his arms and stretching his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In silence, the heart of the ice penetrates from under the skin, just like the first time I saw it, like a foreign object embedded in the skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg looked down and found that the ice heart at the moment was not the ice blue ice, but turned into lacquer black, it seems to be a The same as the baby who is holding the whole body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark baby is carved like an obsidian, the size of the fist, lifelike. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are densely intricate tentacles around it that radiate around the body, connecting the darkened blood vessels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗷呜呜呜...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghost that wanders around seems to feel something, mouth There was a burst of screams that were as far away as Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even, those who are not wise in the streets are extremely afraid of Su Ge, instinctively around the circle of the radius of ten meters centered on Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gradual four-week atmosphere of death forms a cyclone centered on the Su Ge, slowly rotating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the constant intake of death, the horrible black blood vessels of Su Ge’s body squirmed rapidly, and finally even detached from the surface of the skin, wrapped around the left side. On the cane, the right side was wrapped around a black glove. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a bang, this moment is like a power switch is closed, the heart, cane, and black gloves form a perfect cycle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More breath of death has been more attracted, pouring into his body from various parts of Su Ge's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The left hand can't be nourished by this breath, first changed back to the silver long gun form, then became, long sword form, chain sword form. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, two new forms have emerged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first type is an iron umbrella form, similar to a conventional umbrella. The diameter of the umbrella surface is about one meter five. It consists of a single metal, giving a kind of Very sci-fi feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second form is the shape of the wire, and the entire cane becomes a silver-gray of about five meters long with two chains of thumb thickness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this Su Ge is not unexpected. When he first met Ron, he said that there are more than a dozen forms of this weapon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shape of the cane changed a circle and returned to the most conventional cane form. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right hand, the glove that is entangled in the tentacles, controls Su Ge’s palms and gradually squeezes the skull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咔蹦! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few seconds later, under the influence of Su Ge’s palm and tentacles, the skull was crushed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the moment of crushing, there was a burst of violent terrorist power in the skull, just like a missile that was about to erupt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horrible cold flames were suddenly wrapped up in countless deaths when they were about to burst, and then incorporated into black gloves under the tentacles. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a time, this glove started to squirm like alive, like a python that just had a meal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a minute, the gloves returned to calm, the overall shape of the gloves did not change much, but if you look closely, you can see that there is a faint "under the six-star snowflake on the back of the hand." A white flaming sign of the mountain type. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this regard, the ice skull is actually blended with the black gloves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the fusion of the gloves, Su Ge felt a lot of energy and death breath into his body along the tentacles of his right hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This moment, Su Ge felt that his body was filled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This feeling...is really bad!" Su Ge’s tough body, his body seems to be a balloon full of air, ready to explode. Danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A ring of bells came, and this massive amount of energy seemed to find a vent, in some mysterious way, from the flesh to the soul of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge only felt a sigh of his head, and the violent pain made his brain blank and fainted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a shackle, Su Ge feels comfortable lying in a black general. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time the whole world has only two colors, black and white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is standing in black, his skin is very white, but his white seems to be infected, his eyes and hair are turned black, without any impurities. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking up into the sky, the white sky has a huge clock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three things on the clock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A black robe, a black glove, and a silver cane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bell came, and in the black and white world suddenly there are countless blue ghosts lingering between the heavens and the earth, seemingly waiting for something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the big clock to see the sky, he saw countless fallen meteors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And above the meteor, an incomparably huge red-red planet gradually descended. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a huge eye on the planet that gives an indescribable fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, what is desperate is not the planet, but the starry sky behind the planet, the horrors that are indescribable in form. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his mind, he heard a voice that seemed to be self-reported and seemed to be reading. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the "unexplained period", once dominated the human dreams, in the past, the dark former dominators came back again, and the world was once again shrouded in distorted dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
