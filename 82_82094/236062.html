			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the dark son who was completely dissipated, Su Ge stood in meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mother? Betraying the father of the Stars? Saying me?" In the face of such a slap in the face, even the gods thinking Su Ge would not understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight descended from the sky, one of the knights walked over and took the skull and gloves over and squatted on the ground and handed it to Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge turned his head and looked at it slightly, nodding his head and said, "Close up, this is our spoils for this expedition."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two remnants are secret treasures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The green skull effect is relatively simple, the main effect is to absorb the energy of life, store it inside, release it when needed, and count as an aid The life-saving secret treasure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that black glove is a lot stronger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug saw in the glove the dark shadow attack and the ability to extend the tentacles, which also contained a lot of astral power, but these forces are not Normal humans can be motivated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "With my current strength, I don't have the ability to control any of these two secret treasures. Let's put it together, and then use it later." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After finishing the matter here, Sug turned his head and stared at Ron, who was sitting on the ground not far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Ron’s face was relieved, and there was no sadness and no joy on his face, calmly watching Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two looked at each other and then Suge walked over and looked down at him and asked, "What else is there?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ron smirked and smiled: "No, my life in 1996 has been fulfilled. Thank you!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ron said that he had a hard time getting up and lying on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Worth it?" Su Ge looked at Ron and asked suddenly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ron raised his head slightly, and he could see that his cheeks were slowly falling off and gradually turned into fly ash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through God’s vision, Sug found that Ron’s body had come to the brink of collapse, and even his body should have collapsed two years ago. However, because of a powerful to horrible willpower through the psionics to firmly control the body that collapsed at any time, has continued until now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he is willing, he can continue to continue, but at this time he has given up persistence. Ron relaxed and smiled: "I have been educated since childhood to fear the blood of the ancient gods, to fear the gods, to fear the heavens and the earth, to fear this, to fear that. I I am tired of that theory. From ancient times to now, people have been kneeling on the ground, listening to the teachings and gifts of the so-called gods. I hate this, I want to know all the knowledge of the world, I want to know the secrets of the gods, I I want to pull down the gods that are high above, but unfortunately! I am just an ordinary person, I can't do it. So I set myself some goals, and after I reach that goal, I can die with peace of mind." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Ron lifted his finger, which had disappeared by half, and pointed to the magic book that was left behind: "I will find all that I have explored these years." Knowledge is recorded in it, I am not afraid of death, as long as my knowledge and thoughts are passed on, then my sacrifice is worthwhile. Passing on this knowledge, through the accumulation of souls from generation to generation, I believe that we humans can also Sitting in the same position as the high-ranking gods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speaking of this, Ron’s old face is so brightly smiling, like a happy child: "Every time I think about the hope of the future, I can fear without fear, fearlessness, and ignoring the pain. I can carry on my eternal nickname. As long as my knowledge is passed on, I will become the cornerstone of human beings to defeat the gods. I am willing to be there forever. At the bottom, do the stinky stone that fills the pit and makes countless people disgusted."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pump! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lower body has been completely annihilated, Ron’s body is unable to lie on the ground, eyes watching Su Ge say: “I hope you can make those dead souls redeemed, although I I have never thought that I have done something wrong, but I am really sorry for them ethically."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight on the side silently picked up the magic book and quietly returned to the back of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, I can't see all of your form, it's a pity." Finally, Ron smiled and his head turned into fly ash. Disappear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calling...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cold wind blew, Ron’s flying ash Flying in the air, flying around in the direction of the sunrise, like countless fireflies that rush to the light, very splendid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Human, you have earned my respect, at least when I am a god, I respect you." Su Ge said in a positive tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chuck whispered: "My Lord, we have no time, what else do we need to deal with?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg looked up and looked at the mess, the city of ruins and dead bodies everywhere, Su Ge said: "Give these poor souls to redeem!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, Sug walked back to the battleship on a void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surrounding knight quickly dealt with the suspicious existence around him, and after returning to the battleship, he suddenly raised his rifle in his hand: "The lost soul, listen to the bell Guide back to the Lord's embrace!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! Boom! Boom! Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night clock on the battleship sounded again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this time the bell is different, this time the bell actually has an unspeakable beautiful tone, which seems to be the most beautiful music in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When this is full of ethereal, sacred, and distant bells, the hoarfrost of the entire city gradually gathers, and the frozen buildings and people gradually return to normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the sun rises slowly, the hoarfrost is completely closed and re-includes the battleship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boom! Boom!咚......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bell is still coming out, the people in the library of the Shengxue Library are full of nature and serenity in this bell, just like returning to the embrace of the mother. The same, warm and comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the ten mad men who were tied to the pillars stopped struggling at this time, and the blindfolded eyes seemed to regain consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle, everyone walked out of the Holy Blood Library and looked up at the battleship in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh angsa 唔......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacred, holy chorus is accompanied by the bell Come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Look! Look!" Father Hank first discovered and pointed to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time they saw countless souls in the bells and songs, lost their confusion, turned into a golden salvation state, and later turned into a golden The streamer rose into the battleship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, thousands of sorrows have turned into countless golden streams that fill the sky of Bain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incomparably beautiful, very dazzling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people on the ground looked at the streamers, and the corners of their eyes continued to flow out of tears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not sadness, but they feel the joy and serenity of those souls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a resonance of joy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unconsciously, everyone has been lying on the ground, looking up at the sky, the peace of mind and calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if your entire spirit and soul were deeply baptized, all the fears, pains, and shadows that have been experienced this night are washed away. Return to purity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I feel honored, everyone, this is the gospel of redemption, grateful, and admired!" With the coming of the voice, the battleship disappeared. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
