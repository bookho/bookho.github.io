			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After leaving Vanas, Su Ge returned to the temple to restore his true body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The true reason why the church expelled the Guinness family should be hidden."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The changes in physical characteristics and the death of the infection, these time points occurred after the Guinness family settled the war. It is certain that there is a lot of hidden secrets in the rebellion, even completely The secret of hiding. The location of the kingdom of Guinness is almost the border of the northeast of the Bertrand Empire. Even if the country is no longer mediocre, this important area still has to be won, even if there are many hatreds, but now two There is no problem with the huge strength gap of the country, even if it is conquered by force."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But for the Guinness Principality has been indulged for many years, the empire’s high-level church and the church have been acquiesced His existence. Even this rebellion, did not dare to directly send troops to suppress, take the opportunity to recover, but use the most gentle policy to appease. From this point of view, the two sides are likely to sign some A powerful contract, or a certain presence in the Guinness country that has a church that shocks the Holy Blood, like Luke."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No matter how This time, the distance is definitely going to go. This time, I have to be more careful. The Kingdom of Guinness seems to be closer to the night land. Contact Hills and Randall tomorrow."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next two days, Su Ge was busy preparing for it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, he wants to investigate in detail the customs and customs of the Guinness country, the geographical location, the situation of the people, the inner cemetery of the kingdom, and the situation on the white road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, you need to determine the location around the country, some routes that are suitable for retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After experiencing multiple inadequate battles, Su Ge has learned a lot and summed up a very important conclusion: when you mastered All the possibilities of things, then you have the calm and calm to grasp the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge certainly cannot grasp all the possibilities, but it is still necessary to prepare all the objective and necessary conditions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the morning of the third day, Su Ge was summoned by Archbishop Emilia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After determining the preparations for Su Ge, Emilia nodded with satisfaction and then gave Sug a metal card. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The side of Bishop Eric said: "This is the bank card of the mainland Yuntong firm, they have the safest and most advanced multinational banking system in the world. Even in the war-torn world, their banks are still very reliable. This card is a mission card specially designed for you to use. You can own this card at any bank in the world. In the extraction of Langke. This time your budget has a thousand francs, in that place enough for you to get through enough relationships."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug The card swears: "Please ask the Archbishop to rest assured that this time the goddess will shine into the territory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emilia heard Su Ge confident The tone, more satisfied, stood up and came to Suge and said seriously: "The goddess will not treat any of his people. When you complete this task successfully, you will get everything you need." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amelia, Scotland went straight to Ivan's mysterious workshop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Su Ge came, I watched Ivan take a close look at what Evan and Romane were together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ivan, how is my Assassin Master's jersey?" Suog asked curiously as he walked in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivan looked up and grinned: "I have already done it, we are now studying what name is good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ivan's name is too tasteless." Roland spoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan followed and nodded: "I think the gear armor is pretty good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" What kind of ghost name?" Su Ge blinked and looked awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gear armor? Is there a spring sweater? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland despised Evan, a rigid engineering man, and said, "Okay, this name can be started at any time. Let Su Ge put on the test effect first!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes! Try it first, there are still some time, there are problems to adjust." Ivan said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug has come over at this time, and sighed when he looked down at the past: "Can this West be ugly?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A set of clothes looks very rudimentary, like a thin black close-fitting tights with a seemingly messy thread. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These wires are connected in four directions, with the upper side extending from the shoulder to the arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bottom is extending from under the ribs to the waist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a dark belt around the waist, and there are relatively thin belts around it. This is the inconspicuous storage bag that Ivan said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The overall focus of the clothes is on the arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The organs on the arms are much larger than the Suger imagination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The equipment that can eject the dagger and the claws is very large, like a thin arm, covering the elbow from the wrist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The material of the outer casing is like aluminum, but it is much harder than aluminum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arm is divided into two layers, the outer casing and the inner casing, with a large number of gear circlips and wires in the middle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Su Ge’s left-handed habit, the inside of the left wrist is popped with a dagger, and the right hand pops up with a small claw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Time is too fast, there is no time to study the beauty. This is already the most streamlined way based on the latest silk striker technology. This is the preliminary version, The main focus is on performance and convenience. You don't look complicated, you only need to spend two minutes to wear it." Ivan explained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge took off his robe and showed the white shirt inside. He said, "Come on, try it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Looking, the zipper of the top is Here, first pull the zipper and put on the top to tighten the belt. These two big arm rings are fixed here, and the wire will be put in and closed to close the switch. The two small arm guards also have the switch, after putting on Lock the switch, as long as your arm does not fall, it will not fall off."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the demonstration of Ivan, Su Ge used less than five In minutes, I will wear something that looks complicated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Some uncomfortable, it’s like wearing a wristband for the first time, but it should be able to adapt quickly." Suge moved his body and found it very flexible. Any bloated and blocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Try the dagger and the claws," Ivan said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s left hand twisted and squeezed the internal switch through the muscles of the arm. Suddenly a 30-centimeter-long sharp dagger popped out from the inside of the wrist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then slowly loosen the tight muscles and the daggers are again shrunk back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This thing should be practiced, or it will be funny if you stab yourself." Su Ge was a little cautious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he turned his head to look at the right arm, which needs to be switched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two switches, one for launch and one for retraction, both by the circlip and the positive and negative rotation of the gear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Press the launch switch, a four-claw arrow pops up in front of the front, nailed to the ceiling, Su Ge pulled, and nodded with satisfaction and then pressed back Button. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait!" Evan seemed to think of something and hurriedly yelled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"哎!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but still late, only seeing Su Ge directly Was taken up, the whole person was hung on the ceiling and swayed back and forth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
