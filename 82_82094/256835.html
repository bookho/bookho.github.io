			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The area on the side of the cave is quite large, about two and a half meters high, three meters wide, with kerosene lamps hanging on the walls on both sides, barely illuminating the darkness Cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After about ten meters ahead, it was a turn to the left, and at the moment of the turn, Sug smelled a pungent stench. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, there is a special mask for this clergyman, otherwise the taste is afraid of direct poisoning." Su Ge frowned, his attitude was deeply unhappy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge likes to enjoy this dirty environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "Damn guy, I will kill all your garbage in a while. If you are not a demon here, I will not run here." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continue about seven hundred meters or so, and Su Ge heard a low prayer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear the Sugg convergence and squeeze the cane while taking out a bottle of silver ash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the mysterious duel, this thing can effectively interrupt the mysterious psionic ordering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Advancing gradually against the wall, the air began to get wet, and there was a yellow water like a pus on the ground, which was very disgusting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After careful arrival at the corner, Sug looked at the wall probe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, he felt the stomach rushing and suddenly turned his head back to release a meditation rumor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This group of savage!" Suge's anger has risen to the limit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this corridor, there is a somewhat empty hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle of the hall is sunken down like a cauldron, with strange runes engraved on the edges. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in this hollow place, there are a lot of bodies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are men and women, old and young, and there seem to be at least fifty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These bodies are painted with quirky runes, surrounded by blood that doesn't know where to get it, the internal organs of the animals, and mysterious related materials, including the month. Herbs, fragrant scent, red cloves, etc. are mixed together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it was a mysterious ceremony, the scene was really disgusting, and Nagas almost didn’t spit it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are seven people on the edge who are quietly squatting, and their hands are together seemingly praying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Taking a deep breath, Su Ge opened his mind and looked again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The surrounding runes are the basic Keynes runes, with iron, silver, earth, water, gas, stone, which should be with some souls It’s related, they should be summoning something, not studying what undead pharmacy.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eye stares at the disgusting corpse heap, Sug knows Bieber It is estimated that there are fewer evils. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bell rings again, with mysterious ripples spreading around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, the internal situation of the entire cave appeared in his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is the only one who is here. The interior of the hall has two corridors leading to the inside. There are still two at the end of the two corridors. Spacious room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In one of the rooms, there are two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the description of the sound wave, it is one big and one small. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The height is about one meter and five meters... Isn’t Bieber still dead?" Su Ge suddenly opened his eyes, and there was a hope in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is still an adult inside, from the position of two people, what should be said, not coming out, then..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug spit out a chill, and the body leaned against the wall and walked silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who!?" There seems to be some warning system here. When Su Ge entered, the believers near here suddenly turned around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment he turned his head, the sword in the hands of Su Ge suddenly became a chain sword, and the wind with the whistling wind was wrapped around him. Around the neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;唰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood splatters, the corpse is separated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the remaining five people suddenly reacted, and stood up in a sly manner, not to mention the rush to Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The mad believer!?" Su Ge's eyebrows are picking up, his wrists glimpsing, like a snake-like chain sword, changing direction, entangled the front of the mad believers . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Su Ge still underestimated the fanaticism of the mad believers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The torn flesh and blood of the mad believer actually grabbed the chain sword wrapped around his body, using his own arm bones to die the main chain of the sword , Da Daodao: "For the god of death!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, Su Ge’s chain sword is firmly stuck and cannot be recovered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a madman!" Su Ge snorted and immediately let go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, three mad believers with daggers have rushed to the front, and they screamed and madly attacked Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For the god of death!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sure enough to be a death sect!" Su Ge thought The body quickly receded and the hands clasped together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bell that can be heard in the ear suddenly sounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bathing the bell!" Su Ge said, his arms slammed open as if he was hugging something, and then suddenly pushed forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, flesh and blood, screaming again and again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The invisible sharp edge passes by, blurring the flesh and blood of these three mad believers, just as if they were just late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unable to wait for Sugson's tone, the left corner suddenly bulged two arrows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg does not turn behind, and a night clock can easily block these two arrows with little strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fellows! Get up!" The old man who had been hiding behind him screamed at the moment, and the five believers who had just been killed by Su Ge actually stood up again. Stretched out and grabbed at Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have entered the realm of the god of death, where we are not dead!" The old man was arrogant at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge snorted: "Say the same as the real thing!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, just let go Take out a silver ash powder and sprinkle it on the bodies of five people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five bodies were suddenly stiff and fell to the ground again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What!?" The old man saw this moment with a glimpse of his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge passed the corpse and said faintly: "This kind of trick is scaring to scare ordinary people. You really think that you are facing the real mystery. Is it effective?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the conversation, the archers in the corner are still archery, and with the continuous shooting, they have shattered the night clock of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug was a little annoyed, and suddenly stared back at the archer in the shadow and sipped: "Roll!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; While the archer over there heard the sound, the ear rang for a while and could not describe the horrible sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! The archer threw away the bow and arrow, and both hands clasped his hair with a scream of heartbreaking screams and ran out like crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This...this..." The old man saw this look very horrified, his face paled on the rock wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
