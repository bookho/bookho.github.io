			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the dream, Su Ge sits on the throne with a trace of struggle and entanglement in his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to think through the body of the gods, but there is a faint fear in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the last battleship evolved into a cemetery, Su Ge has a deeper understanding of the body's ability to master and use it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most obvious of these is this powerful analytical power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous parsing ability required a large number of relevant clues to make a consistent derivation of consistency. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nature is far from the level of the gods, can only be said to be a very very intelligent person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time it is different, Su Ge clearly feels that the thinking he has come into contact with is more advanced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of high-level seems to suddenly change from animal thinking to human thinking, a qualitative change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But for this kind of thinking, Su Ge did not feel happy, but felt some fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because this kind of thinking has completely separated from the human form, it has entered a level that humans cannot understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, at the time of Su Ge’s state, when he thought of people, his attention in his mind was no longer in human form and form, character and joke, but in Muscle, skin, bones, cells, spirits above these. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like a butcher looking at a dead animal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, Su Ge’s consciousness is actually: "This low-level creature actually evolved in addition to its own language, a little meaning. There is time to explain it. Their brains and throats."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This kind of thinking, this focus makes Su Ge instantly shocked a cold sweat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before the thinking has already begun to have an impact on my real thinking. Today's influence is even greater. Once the mentality really changes, my whole spirit can be said to be completely out of human form." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Su Ge suddenly woke up and sat up and gasped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I haven't got married yet, I haven't had a child yet, or I am a virgin. I don't want to see the beauty of the world in the future, I can't see beautiful women." The voice is not good, muttering to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The kind of thinking just got too irritating. If you see a woman later, your attention is on muscle structure, soul state and bone density. It’s a hero!” Su Ge’s heart was full of horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, today's body can't be used casually, you can't use it at all times!" Su Ge's demeanor is determined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then gave himself a meditation rumor, Su Ge turned and squatted on the bed, his mouth was bitter: "This upgraded, and the problem has risen, this time It’s good to give me the gold finger that I used to give me up.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Can I downgrade, or restore the factory settings?” Turned around and hugged the pillow, Su Ge’s face was wronged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unconsciously, Su Ge slept calmly, this time he did not enter the dream, but sleep peacefully with human ideology. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Su Ge woke up again, the first thing I felt was that the warm sun shone through the window on the left hand side, just in front of my face. While warm, it gives a comfortable peace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Su Ge did not realize this kind of peace, and was interrupted by a rush of knocking on the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who!" Su Ge got up and put on his nightgown and walked over to open the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just opened the door and saw Elena cold face and asked: "How about the rest? Bishop Sotos!!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge heard the words of the bishop and knew that she was very dissatisfied with her concealed performance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Su Ge’s eyes turned: “This dress is really for you, beautiful Elena.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today Irina wears as an aide Long formal dress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The upper body is a neat and clean white shirt, a gray tight robes outside the shirt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The style of the robes is a modified version of the Master's Gown. The upper body is tight and tight, and the collar of the white shirt is just at the collar. There are two rows of buttons on the chest. This delicate pattern looks very formal and dignified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The robes of the lower body are somewhat like windbreakers, with the front half exposed and the back extending all the way to the shoes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the robes are neutral long pants with black rounded flat shoes on the feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dress of this body is much better than before. If it was a hot maid before, now Elena becomes dignified. Mature woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No woman can stand up to praise for herself, Elena screamed: "Hurry up and clean up, your majesty calls you past."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened?" Su Ge asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illina’s face was dignified, and the color said: “There was a small plague in the city, and people infected with the plague became werewolves.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this Su Ge’s heartbeat, I immediately turned around and said, “Give me half an hour.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Su Ge prepared very speed, half an hour later, two people have come to Vanas's study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a large number of people in the study room, including politicians wearing suits, soldiers wearing military uniforms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the desk, Vanas, wearing a solemn black skirt, sat in a chair and seemed to be thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s eyes turned and he found the old demon mil who was sitting on the sofa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, he was calm and relaxed, and tasted the coffee in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your Majesty, what's going on!" When Su Ge came in, everyone's eyes were locked on him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first to speak is a 30-year-old, blond-haired officer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This officer is similar to the guardian Jimmy, but the age is bigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is wearing a dark military uniform and his face is full of alert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, I heard that he is a member of the Church of the Holy Blood. Our Kingdom of Guinness has always been very unfriendly with the Church of the Holy Blood, and the Church of the Holy Blood is for our country. For a long time, he is likely to be a spy that interferes with our wars!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thin-eyed, middle-aged bald-headed man of fifty-year-old said sharply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This suddenly caused everyone to resonate. There were seven ministers in the house, all of them voiced their voices and expressed doubts about Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas suddenly said: "Quiet!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One time, everyone The words stopped abruptly and looked calmly at Vanas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas said calmly: "Don’t be misunderstood by the family, calling Bishop Sotos is not a meeting with us, but Master Mill is looking for him. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One listened to Mil looking for Su Ge, these people suddenly feel relieved, and then with a trace of gloating on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of them know that Mil is a horrible monster, and that all who are called by him have not finished a good end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mill stood up and walked over to Su Ge and said, "Let's go, I heard that you want to express the sincerity of the church. It's very simple, then you I am dispatched."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug did not refuse, and after turning to Vanas’s standard salute, he turned and followed Mil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
