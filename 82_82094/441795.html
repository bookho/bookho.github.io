Su Ge, you are the one who can really make a big difference, I hope you can Have a broader volume, don't affect your mental state or even judgment for some other reason." Emilia said calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger immediately nodded hard after listening: "Please rest assured that after this incident, I will restrain it in the future, and keep it A gas field and volume that a bishop should have."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You already have enough gas field, you are missing the volume." Emilia stressed Said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, Emilia said faintly: "I don't want this kind of thing to happen for the second time, solve this problem as soon as possible."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Su Ge’s calm answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emeria turned and prepared to leave, whispering as she passed by Su Ge: "The root cause of the witch is in the north, returning to Guinness as soon as possible, The big thing is going to happen, Guinness is a good place."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge listened to his heart and looked up at Emily’s respectful answer: "Understand, Archbishop."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Emilia left, Father Hank sighed and whispered: "You are too aggressive this time." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly: "Well, but I have a measure."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finished, he turned Walk into the ward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soundproofing of the ward was very good, and the two people inside did not hear anything outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feeling that Su Ge came in, Anthony took the lead in opening his gray eyes, and his eyes looked a little godless and smiled at Su Ge: "Thank you, it feels much better." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge sat down and asked, "What happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marlene said, "We brought Bryce back to his house and got the book. When we got the book ready to leave, we were suddenly attacked. The man was wearing a black robe. It drives a very strange monster to swallow us. In the belly of the monster, we feel that the power of evil and evil has penetrated into our spirit, polluting us, and then the frantic and crazy thoughts are filled in our hearts. ...I don't know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony nodded: "I am similar."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Monsters... Those monsters suddenly appeared?" Su Ge asked. Father Anthony nodded. "Yes, suddenly, even the black man suddenly appeared. I don't know where he is hiding." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suger’s mind quickly analyzed a circle and then nodded: “Understood, take a rest.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; After that, Sug turned and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you know who the murderer is?" Father Hank asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly: "You are just here, don't move."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finish, turn and leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the aftermath of the evening bell spread. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go forward about 20 meters, turn left and go five meters to a ward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inside, Bryce sat on the bed in a sluggish manner, like a wooden man, motionless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug pushes the door in, Bryce is still sluggish, motionless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night of the town’s soul is ringing again, but there is still no reaction to Bryce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge sat quietly beside his bed and asked, "Are you also a Byron Dias?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Bryce still motionless and didn't seem to hear it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug continued: "The father and son are out of control under your guidance. After becoming a monster, instinctively go to find you, right? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bryce still doesn't move, it seems really stupid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lam Ward, you shouldn't know that he still has a diary?" Su Ge continued to speak to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Bryce is not silent, making a hoarse voice: "I am very curious, it is impossible to know my identity in his diary, you are How did you think of me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Blythe, who was still sluggish, was like a person, his face was calm, his eyes were deep, his face was A little curious, like a wise senior professor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You know that you are not in the diary, why should you respond to me?" Su Ge did not answer, asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bryce’s mouth reveals a smile: “I don’t like to bend around, I can feel your chest. In this case, I’m still stupid.” It would be too boring."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge silenced, his eyes calmly watching him: "In the near future, I will kill you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why not now?" Bryce asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not interested in 傀儡." Su Ge calmly answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ha ha ha! It is the genius bishop of the church, the king of Guinness, how did you find out?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the two people seem to be a very good friend, telling each other's situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s body leaned against the chair and lifted his legs and said, “You heard the bell, but there was no reaction, which made me doubt. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Block!!" Bryce listened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge continued: "The voice from the valley is a sacred announcer. No one can refuse the appeasement of the night of the soul. And you actually refused, so you are not a human."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bryce heard a strange smile on his lips: "Confidence in self-confidence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course, Not only that. Although you are not a human, it does not mean that you have a relationship with this matter. Another key is still Ram's diary. Our investigation of the father and son did not have any mysterious connection with anyone, but Ram It is said that there is a person who can get in touch with them. The two people at that time were completely crazy, but the instinct is still there. If something happens, like a child who is being bullied, he will find a parent who can shelter himself. Two people who have changed can find it. You want to seek your asylum. When I first entered, I heard your prayers. At that time, you should be calming their spirits, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"And the painting on the blackboard is The great grandeur of the painting. It is not your ancestors who held the Holy Grail, Byron the Great, but someone in the modern age."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bryce clap his hands: "The analysis is very correct, I really can't see it. You are only twenty-five years old this year."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the cause and effect, Su Ge asked: "Byron The Dias, the survivors who have been silent in the years, do you really think that what you have come into contact with can you return to the country?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bryce smiled: "Of course not. I know exactly what it is. My dreams have been connected with Him, and I know how desperate and fearful it is."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But!" He was firm in his tone and a little helpless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is no way. From ancient times, after Byron the Great lifted the "Holy Grail of the Soul", there is no redemption in his blood. The possibility, we are always his slave, his hound."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge did not speak, looked at him calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bryce smiled even more brilliantly: "I don't regret it, I won't be confused. He opened a new door for me and made me see a new world." Let me know the essence of this desperate world. As long as the three moons in the sky are still there, there is no possibility of redemption in the whole world. The only difference is that we will die worse than you."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But it doesn't matter, it's all dead, it's not terrible, and there is no substantive difference. I have mastered such inhuman knowledge, which makes me feel very happy and unprecedented. Su Ge Sotos, Do you think that people are alive, what is the meaning of life?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge looked up, just a pair of dark, completely confronted with a pair of green eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug saw this awkward. He saw the sprinkling in the depths of his eyes, saw the happiness, and saw the nature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The meaning of life is different for everyone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The meaning of your life is What? Or, what is your dream!” Bryce flashed his eyes at this moment, as if it were a simple child, and he was naive to find the idea of ​​a playmate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge looked up at the ceiling and thought for a few seconds, staring at his eyes: "I hope to get rid of the despair of the world and let it out of the moonlight." , hug the sunrise."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bryce’s smile on his mouth is bigger and he asks, “Is it happy for you?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug with a longing for the year, said: "Of course, when this is all over, people can live and work in peace, not after the sacrifices of those advanced creatures, I will take My wife and friends, returning to the country, becoming a farmer, walking on a quiet path, enjoying the gentle spring breeze; lying under the grape rack, the sun shines on me, tastes delicious wine, and says to old friends Past past events.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“A very beautiful and harmonious scene.” Bryce nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In this desperate, world that does not see any hope, the meaning of human life is happiness and pleasure. For this, I can dedicate everything to me, even if It’s a broken bone. Su Ge, unlike your future vision, I feel very happy now, even if the whole world is destroyed, even if all humans are extinct, I will not stop pursuing this pleasure.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge regained his spirit and watched him calmly say: "So I will destroy your pleasure and end your dreams. I will kill all of you and even kill Your God."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
