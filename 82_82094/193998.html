			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony heard Su Ge’s answer and looked happy: “The enthusiasm for your study is well known. The seriously injured Bishop’s adults are very keen on your learning spirit and serious attitude. Appreciation is added."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge was a little embarrassed and smiled: "Can't live up to everyone's expectations."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh yes, do you remember Ivan?" asked Father Anthony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ivan?" Su Ge thought about it, and immediately remembered when he was hospitalized for the first time, when he met Father Anthony, the one around him. A young and introverted youth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Some impressions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Anthony said with enthusiasm: "Ivan is a mystery The researchers have repeatedly improved the hunting magic bullets and weapons used in the game. He was originally a candidate for the purple moon, but because he was too insulted to study, he did not have any combat power and lost his qualifications." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly: "I haven’t seen him for the past half-month."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He can't hide in his workshop almost every day. Since you are so interested in mystery, I can introduce you to follow Ivan. Although he is not good at words, he has even exceeded the mysterious research. Bishop and Master Geros, I don’t know if you are willing or not.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Su Ge’s spirit said: “Of course I am willing!” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony listened happily and said: "I will take you to the past after lunch. I believe that both of you will be very close."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After, two Individuals are separated from each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh yes! What kind of injury did the bishop suffer? This has not recovered for a long time?" Su Ge asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony is not very sure to say: "It seems that the eyes have been injured, and have not recovered yet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;噗通! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this Suge suddenly jumped into the heart and then returned to normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh! That's really serious." Su Ge said quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farewell to Father Anthony, Su Ge frowned: "What happened? Just that was a hint from my instinct. Is that important? Is the secret hidden by me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that the eye is hurt, and it has not fully recovered yet..." Su Ge thought of this sentence carefully Thinking about the meaning of each of these words, but did not find any clues that were ignored by myself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"嘶嘶嘶!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Excessive thinking once again caused the sting of the Sog brain . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hope is because the mental concerns are too much, too nervous." Su Ge comforted himself back to the chapel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the church, because the church has very sound heating facilities, even if it has been two days, no one is still very warm here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go to the bedroom on the second floor, Sug sat on the bed and opened the bedside table, and there was a thick black book in the drawer on the inside: Glen The night clock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get the big book up, and Su Ge slowly flips back from the title page. Studying the previous few words carefully, I feel more and more savvy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go to the text and see a chapter: the era of war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction to the protagonist because of the displacement of the war, in the escape to experience all the ugliness of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later, the thief chased and fled to a valley full of fog, where it was called the territory of death. Because all the people who entered did not live to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man who had been completely desperate walked in, and in the confusion he went to the depths of the valley and saw a magnificent three-story temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the top of the temple, there is a big black clock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait!" Seeing this Su Ge’s eyes wide-eyed and carefully looked at the description in the text, and then compared with his own memory, he suddenly found out that this valley is deep. The temple is exactly the same as the temple on his battleship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a huge sense of trepidation spread from the soul to the whole body of Su Ge, can not tell whether the fear or excitement occupies his spirit, let him The whole spirit has fallen into a state of uneasiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's going on? What's going on?" In this state, Suger's brain was violently thinking, and the sting was sorghum before. The spirit of the cover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Call coincidence? No! How could this kind of thing be a coincidence? What is it? The temple and the battleship are not one? It was a reality long ago. "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Still said that the author of this book once touched the battleship through a dream, vaguely portrayed the temple and wrote it into the book. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although it is a novel, but seeing this can not be seen as a novel. If the author has not seen the battleship in the dream, then It is very likely that the content here is a secret that is covered by time, and even has important clues to find out my body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Su Ge is completely excited Get up, the gasps speed up, the eyes sparkle with scary light, staring at the pages of the hand, greedy reading. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time reading is not a previous ten-line, but a word-by-word reading, even the punctuation of the pokes has not fallen, for fear of missing something important message. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first chapter ends with the man finding the temple, and then enters the second chapter: the bell of the desperate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second chapter is that men approaching the temple caused attacks by monsters in the valley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man was helplessly approaching the temple, but found that the gate of the temple could not be entered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course I can't enter, there is the temple of God!" Su Ge spit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man desperately climbed down the cliff along the cliff and climbed to the top of the temple, the edge of the big bell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, there are no long guns on the big clock, otherwise I will not have anything to do." Su Ge took the spit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why Su Ge can make the body of God is because he does not know why the rifle was pulled out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the rifle has the body of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continue reading. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man is surrounded by monsters, he can only hide at the top of the tower waiting for the coming of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, while he was waiting, he heard the big clock ringing irregularly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the big clock is extremely thick, with a strong pressure and an indescribable mysterious power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bells spread out and all the monsters around them were swept away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monster is gone, but the man has not left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because his eyes, soul, everything is attracted by this big clock, he feels that the big clock is his own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat there with the devil, doing everything, listening to the bells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second chapter ends here, followed by the third chapter: standing in the realm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man dedicated everything to the bell, he sat here, tasted carefully, studied the vibration of the bell, the temperament of the bell, the bell The transmission, the power of the bell, and even the study of what this bell symbolizes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gradually got the trick. He began to imprint the big bell in his memory through the spirit. When the big bell vibrates, the mental simulation bell sounds a similar vibration. The vibration of imitation gradually grasps the inner knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
