			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug stood by the captain for a long time, and even forgot that the church is about to be in place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year and a half of travel has made him experience the ugliness of countless human beings, the enthusiasm and cruelty of clergy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the constant induction of Shirley, Su Ge’s heart is quietly approaching towards the inhuman road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at this moment, he felt the chest was stuffy and even felt pain in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the episode of the Madonna, it is just the kind of tragedy and selfless resonance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw the goodness of mankind in these two people, saw the struggle of mankind, and saw the courage and observance of mankind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Especially these two people are still clergy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has had a huge impact on Su Ge’s will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The track that has gradually deviated has returned to the human race again in this anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"March Goddess!" Su Ge said in his mouth, his eyes looked up at the three rounds of the moon in the sky, and his words were full of hatred and anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is always a day when I will completely save the whole world from the hands of your evil spirits!" At this moment, Su Ge’s will is more than ever firm. And decisive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking down at the captain’s face, he could see a calm, peaceful smile on this bloody face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s hard to imagine that this smile can be revealed on the faces of people who have experienced so much grief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe only such people can show such a happy smile when they die, and the good deeds of people do not allow these evil spirits to trample this way."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s hand, a slight vibration stripped all the blood on the captain’s face, revealing a pale, handsome face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silently, Su Ge put together the bodies of several people, and even the head of the monster was placed beside the captain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Taking a deep breath, Su Ge was on the ground for a prayer that had not been done for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The distant bells came out of the fog, and they led the lost souls. The glory of my Lord bloomed in the center of the world, breaking through despair, spreading hope. Storm-like warships linger in the fog, expelling terrible monsters. The ideal holy city appears in the illusion, sheltering the good of mankind, the beauty of mankind, the hope of mankind."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Because of the glory of my Lord, execute justice, eliminate prejudice, and protect the people, and shine in the world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are storms and The Lord of Death, the only true God of the Valley and the Abyss, the ruler of the dream, the dominator of death, the believer of the fog, the Lord, will lead the souls of the scorpions to the other side, enjoying the eternal peace and quiet in the evening bell." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The improved prayers play an indescribable great power in a sacred and distant bell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, five souls, the souls bound by the filthy things, faded away in the washing of the bells and turned into five golden souls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five people floated in midair, glanced at each other and looked at Su Ge on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five people are deeply stunned at the same time, and they sing: "Thank you for your kindness, thank you for your salvation. May God be able to shelter you forever, hope that the light will always be Illuminate your way forward."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, the five people turned into streams that could not be seen by ordinary people and disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In silence, Su Ge stood up in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden clutter of footsteps in the ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dozen or so clergymen walked over and looked like they didn't wake up, and they looked reluctant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The damn cultist!" The priest who ran over at this time just saw Sug standing next to the body of the clergyman and watching them indifferently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a moment, everyone decided that Su Ge was the murderer who killed these people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge is in a very bad mood at this time, lacking interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right hand slammed against these people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shock wave of a horrible moment instantly appeared, and the master’s knowledge directly flew these people out of a dozen meters and fell to the ground, mourning and horrified at the same time. Some clergymen are even scared to turn and run. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug did not pay attention, turned his body and disappeared into the night with a mist, leaving the priests who were undecided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benice at home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Su Ge came back, Shirley was kneeling on the bed to read the novel. When she saw Su Ge coming in, Shirley instantly felt that Su Ge was not right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong?" Shelley sat up and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug did not even undress and slowly took off the mask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shelley saw two lines of tears flowing down Suog’s eyes, his eyes flushed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl was shocked to see this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first time she saw Su Ge crying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with her knowledge of Su Ge, how can such a person suddenly cry? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's wrong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge didn't talk, squatting in bed and burying her head in her In the arms, silent tears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl did not show the ridicule and indifference of the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She thought, her awkwardly open arms hugged Su Ge’s neck, like a mature big sister, comforting her injured brother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the edge of a cliff, Ada, who was in white, sat there, and the holy smooth ankle was shaking slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her eyes sparkled with brilliant brilliance, seemingly looking at something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, she reached out and touched her chest and felt some blockage in her chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes gradually returned to normal, and she was soft and said: "Good guy, you have finally reached this step."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Goodness is not a bad thing, saving the world is not a burden. Love crying is not cowardly, sadness is not fragile. You can come to this step and show that you are enough to recognize yourself, I have set my own attitude and identity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Before the path you have taken has failed, God cannot save people, God only brings people Destruction and despair."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can save people as long as they are human."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I am still closing now, I hope that when I can't do anything, you can hold the key to open this threshold."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Little guy, I believe you can finally The human identity ends this eternal cycle. By that time, I can also nest in your arms like Sherry, waiting for a beautiful sunrise. . Eternal peace "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Then she turned into a glorious disappear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The calm serenity has passed in the bedroom for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug holds Shirley, carefully and carefully, and tells the story of his own experience without pulling down the details. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing such a scene, Shirley did not sneer at the low-level ignorant bugs before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She kept silent, with rare thoughts in her eyebrows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
