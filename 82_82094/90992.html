			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Father, he woke up." Some ears of tweets heard a female voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge turned slightly and saw a senior priest dressed in a white robe and a kindly face plucked into the bed and walked in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you awake?" The priest smiled as if he was a grandfather. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded slightly, opening his mouth to speak but being stopped by the priest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do not talk first, your mouth and tongue have been severely corroded by potions. It is best not to use them now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug can only nod. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest sat down and said with admiration: "I have heard about your business. It is a very great priest."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"??" Su Ge’s brain is a little confused, not knowing what the priest is saying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest saw the confusion in Su Ge’s eyes and explained: “Your whole body function has been disturbed by the potion, and the over-stimulation of the shark potion makes you Some memory faults in the head, this is only temporary, different in a hurry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug continues to nod. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There has been a notification from your family that you have recently needed special training at the Church of the Holy Blood to stay here temporarily." The priest will continue The intelligence of Su Ge’s relationship is spoken one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am now giving you a blood bottle with gecko blood as the main body. It can stimulate your body tissue and accelerate the healing of the split. Wait for this blood bottle input. After that, I will give you a tiger-based blood bottle, which can give your body enough nutrition and have the effect of strengthening your body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Su Ge’s head has not fully reacted, only nodded numbly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, with a tingling headache in his head, Su Ge’s eyelids could not be opened, slowly closing and sleeping again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the priest saw this sigh and did not bother, he stood up and said to the nun who was wearing a white monk's robe: "Take care of this heroic little priest, this is the common command of Bishop Ron and Master Geros." /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nun finished listening and said, "You can rest assured, Father Hank."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Blood Church Backyard Medical In the hall of the district, in a place similar to the church hall, Gerlos was sitting on a bench in a long trench coat of the demon hunter. The two swords behind him leaned aside and looked at the prayers in front of the March statue. The old man wearing a white gilt robes said: "I think it is better to continue to investigate this matter. After all, in the highland area, the Twins can't reach this long distance."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man stood up, a full-fledged national character, with a strong body and gray hair, like an old general, although old, but the spirit remains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the highest person in charge of the entire city of Bain, the leader of the Cathedral of the Holy Blood, Bishop: Ron Shelley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishop Ron turned and looked at Jellos and said, "Dear Gerlos, you are the top master of the demon hunter, but you don't know these. The habits and tentacles of those cults. I got news about ten days ago, and the branch structure of a group of Geminis quietly sneaked into the empire and seemed to be searching for something. We have conducted a detailed investigation and it is indeed the handwriting of the Twin Alliance. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerousus frowned and said: "I always feel that there are some weird problems here. What is the purpose of doing this?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishop Ron sat down and patted the shoulders of his old friend and said, "Don’t think things are so complicated, my friend. You have handled this perfectly. I have already reported the situation with the things of the previous death sect. According to the Central Hospital, you can become the Archbishop after all the reviews."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Recalling the Archbishop, Gerlos takes out the pipe : "You should be very clear, to become archbishop is not my real purpose, I just want to restore my feelings." <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Ron heard the silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Losing feelings can certainly make the demon hunter unfavorable. But for a long time, the emptiness that can't be touched and expressed, it's easy to drive people crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under normal circumstances, the demon hunter who loses his fear and other feelings should be the most stable and least likely to get out of control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, according to the list of church madness in recent years, the probability of madness of the hunter is far more than that of the sacred sword team, becoming the first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "May Goddess bless you and let you fulfill your wishes," Ron whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerous does not believe in these things, stand up and hang two swords behind him and prepare to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time Father Hank walked over and said: "Bishop, Master Geros."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jie Lost turned and asked: "How is Su Ge's situation, Little Hank?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father, 54-year-old Father Hank did not have the slightest title for this title. Dissatisfied, respectfully said: "It has already awakened, but the sequela of the shark potion still exists, and the memory has a fault. It is estimated that it will take two days to recover."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Gerlos nodded slightly and said: "He is a hero, give him the most effective blood bottle, don't leave any sequelae."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ron at this time Sighed: "I have never seen such a passionate and brave young man for a long time. You found a good seedling."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss gave him a look Say: "Then I will be included in the church as soon as possible, and receive systematic training. After the Lunar New Year is over, it is the Blood Festival, which represents what you know very well, we need Big god officer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ron nodded and said, "Reassured, I know. But the necessary process is still there. The time is still too short. Wait. At the end of his internship, he will immediately become a clergyman and enter the scepter for relevant training and study."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerousin snorted, then Go out of the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
