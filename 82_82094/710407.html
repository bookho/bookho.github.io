			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ps: Not checked, upload first, modify it right away)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of Laurie’s question, Jean proudly stepped forward and replied: “The clockman is saving Guinness and helping Guinness get rid of the werewolf plague. At that time, we have already believed in the great storm and the Lord of death!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You...you are so bold!" Laurie was mad at his eyes. A black, almost a squirt of old blood<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jean sneered: "In the beginning, your inaction, let the death sects run wildly.The entire population of hundreds of thousands of residents in the studio has become a crazy werewolf. If it is not the adult, Guinness has already died! We are courageous and have nothing to do with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one-eyed bishop said fiercely: "Do you know the end of the cult?" That is to be destroyed! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jean is not afraid: "In the doctrine of March, the werewolf itself is a heresy, the concept of the werewolf has taken root, you are self-righteous The hypocritical guy will really let us go? By that time, even if we don't kill us, then Guinness will become your experimental field and become the next Mauser fishing village! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard the words of Mauser Fishing Village, the three archbishops changed their faces.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Looking for death!" A cold cry, black shadows and blood stains appear instantly<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touch! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very powerful weird shield easily blocks two people’s attacks<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although I am an old man, my lovely grandson is not something you can touch.""Before the fog flashed through the vigorous and powerful voice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get out! Ghostly guy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the voice, one must be white, and his body is awkward. The old man in a worn hunter’s costume is coming out from behind Su Ge.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mir! You entered the lord!?" Laurie saw the old man, his eyes tightened<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guines's hunter-hunter, Mill, broke through the limitations of the Devil's Potions a year ago, with the help of hunting, not only repairing The injury, but also jumped to the realm of the lord<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mill holds a dark golden sword with a strange pattern saying: "Thanks to the blessing of my Lord, not only the injury is restored, but finally qualified to step into The realm that has always been admired"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, Mil turned around and looked around, sighing slightly: "I haven’t come back for decades, this time the bloody taste is still so strong, people I feel sick and bored when I smell it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mir is a hunter of the era of Gerlos, disappearing after a mission failure<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the era of Mill’s activity, they were just dolls who just joined the church.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the generation, they should respectfully call Mir a grandfather<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the three were silent, Mil turned and prayed to Su Ge: "The bishop of the fog, the demon mir, sees the clock"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled and nodded: "I haven't seen you for more than a year, you can come to this step, I am really happy.""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Guinness, Mill’s help for Su Ge was huge.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not the help of potions, in so many hardships, Su Ge couldn’t hold on.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The potion and the sacred mark of the lake are the two most important guarantees in the mysterious battle of Su Ge.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it’s Master Mill who brought him to the potion road<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mill listened with a smile and said: "Thanks to the blessing of my Lord, I can see the new realm and the world.""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Geping and said: "All this is a cycle of cause and effect, it is the will of my Lord.""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Su Ge’s voice turned and he said indifference: "Now, follow the will of my Lord and let this world covered by blood." Get a hope of redemption! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the change of words, there is also mil’s sight.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unique demon hunter looks at the three archbishops in front of him: "I have to say that the setting of the mysterious profession of the demon hunter is really clever.The special substance produced as a by-product of the study of the Holy Blood Maze not only loses some emotions when strengthening the body, but also becomes an invisible shackle that binds all the devil's thoughts and desires for knowledge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For many years, the demon hunter could not enter the lord because the hunter had learned too much knowledge and the knowledge of his system could not be refined."However, this is not true. It is not a miscellaneous knowledge to truly bind the demon hunter into the lord, but the invisible shackles formed by the agent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, Mil's gaze glides like a knife on the faces of the three archbishops, and finally falls on Laurie's face:" Little Laurie, I am not dead, right? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three people listened to their faces while they were gloomy<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the point of the Archbishop, more or less have a lot of understanding of the secrets of the church, secretly more familiar with the restrictions of the demon hunter<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Laurie calmly replied: "Can we not let a group of mad people without feelings grasp the real power?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Then why do you want to create so many crazy people without feelings!?" Mil's kind eyes tightened sharply, sharp eyes like two spears sharp, people can't open their eyes<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one-eyed bishop’s tone calmly replies: “Because the world needs tools that carry filth, there are no emotional monsters, the most appropriate"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this disapproval, I clearly felt a horrible anger rising from Mil’s body, and then he gradually appeared four colors next to him. The light ball seems to represent his knowledge<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you do with our group of demon hunters?" Mil slowly took a bottle of dark potion from his arms.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Top Dragon Potions!?" Seeing this, three people are tightening their eyes.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Top Dragon Potion: With 80 points, one drop can kill a thousand healthy adultsThe effect is to increase the user's psionic and physical levels by a factor of six for an hour.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, this top potion is too toxic, even if it is impossible for the hunter to completely digest, so each time you use the dragon potion will cause some toxins Accumulated in the body, making the Demon Hunter's resistance to poison permanently reduced by 1 point<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can see it, Mill knows the real anger at this time.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looked at Mir, who was extremely angry at this time, and had some surprises in his heart.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn’t know about Mill, he only knows that he is a master of indulging in research potions, and he doesn’t know much about his inner thoughts and principles.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The side of Jean whispered: "Mir Grande expressed his sympathy for the experience of many hunters. He has been studying potions for many years, just wanting Develop a potion that can turn the demon hunter into an ordinary person to help other hunters return to normal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear this, Sugton is always clear.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A great man who has a career will have his own obsession<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mill can study the potion for so long, and must have his own goals and persistence<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge stepped forward and stood next to Mill’s side and looked at the three men and said, “Now, accept the trial of the late bell!”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, Mil immediately took the potion, and the black blood vessels that were called horror instantly filled his face, and the whole person became like a non-human monster. In general, the horror to the extreme is constantly drifting around.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop them!" Mill took a moment, and the red ball in the four balls of light instantly became a huge fireball with a diameter of more than two meters. To surpass the church at a horrible speed<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The three are handed over to me! You will kill all the enemies!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, the two men did not hesitate to turn around with their own men and rushed toward the church.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These clerics, where are the opponents of these horrible monsters, at the moment the battle just touched, there were more than a dozen clergymen who died.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lauri and others instantly knew that they were not the opponents of these horrible monsters, so they suddenly launched the ban that the church has not used again for many years.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This order was passed out in a horrible way, but the Suge and others who were present did not hear any abnormalities.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Save as Selena said, is a very vicious ban<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The real power of the church at night seems to be much stronger than we have calculated before."In a corner of the night, the old and plain voice seems to perceive everything that happened in the capital, faintly said.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The ancestors of the ancestors vampires, taming the Yi people, and helping the seriously injured demon hunters with extraordinary power, this seems to have gone far beyond the scope of normal people.It’s really hard to give this kind of existence to the children."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the conversation, accompanied by a squirming darkness, a man wearing a plain robes and a bald skin appeared beside these people.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this man, there is a child who looks about four or five years old, with a small body and a pale skin.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Children look less than one meter high, reminding some of the feelings, pale skin with a little strange lines, eyes and nose closed, with strange skin It seems to be dead<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if you feel carefully, you can clearly feel the horror and power of this little child, especially the kind of psionic power like the sea, it makes people shudder<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Apostle Adult!" Several people in the darkness are respectful and say hello to the bald-headed man.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if it’s like these three horrible existences, the younger generation still in front of the bald black man<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This black-headed pharaoh is naturally a pharaoh known as the apostle of the March goddessAnd speaking, naturally, there are three dominator levels that have never appeared, the elders of the elders’ home.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Pharaoh nodded slightly and said: "To treat the existence of non-humans, naturally use non-human meansEverything is ready, you can shoot it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three people heard this, a feeling of happiness came out of the darkness, and then suddenly burst into a black mist: "The first battle was handed over to me." Let's go! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, this existence disappeared into the night sky<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s attention is not on the ground, because the real crisis is not on the ground<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mil master who served the dragon potion is very horrible, at this time with an enemy three without falling, even faintly will be the three lords of mystery Press under your hand<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Su Ge’s perspective, he couldn’t see anything, only to see Mill’s dancing with the three guys, which looked so embarrassing. It feels like a group of COS dances in the second disease is discovered by an ordinary person.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg is at this moment, it is this feeling<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our evening church is invincible!" At this time, Bernice and Betty have a very proud interest in their hearts, their faces are red, their faces are sparkling.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For anyone, having such a backing is something to be proud of and show off<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg seems to feel something at this time, looking up at the sky and saying: "Next, start..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
