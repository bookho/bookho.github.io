The only way you can preach the power of God is to drag those people into the dream and dominate the dreams. The power of the person can be crushed to death." Xue Lier asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug holds her and says: "There are not a few female warlocks who use the knowledge of dreams. I sneak into other people's dreams. Obtaining intelligence is the means of most female warlocks. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl random rebuttal: "This method is very dangerous. Since the female warlock is going to kill, why not take a direct approach." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg laughed happily, but this smile was a bit gloomy under the dim light of the bedside lamp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If they don't want to enter, then someone will help them." Sug said with a smile, looking through the window to the three rounds of the window. moon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Hausmann Manor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cass is explaining the next considerations to Duke, Stephen, and the four female warlocks headed by Iyeta<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The so-called four principles of the gods are very clear to you, so even in the kingdom of my Lord you are not qualified to see my Lord. But remember, you must not feel any disrespect. The great ordinary people of my master cannot describe. Even if I don't know what language to use to express, when you enter the Kingdom of God, you will understand that feeling."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Looking at Cass's serious look, the six faces nodded solemnly, and they were full of respect and caution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cass is very satisfied with the appearance of the six people, the palm of his hand, do not know where to come up with a fist-sized silver-gray incense burner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This incense burner is almost identical to the incense burner in the hands of Bernice, but the size is much smaller. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a copy of the craftsman in the church, the effect is similar to those artifacts, but the mystery and resonance that it has can only be used once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as Cass had just ignited, Ieta suddenly had a pale face: "No, they are coming."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear this, the other three The female warlock's face is also very bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke still has no feelings, the temptation asks: "Who is here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kass looked sideways and said to the window: "Nature is the female warlocks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this Stephen shocked: "These are all wanted by the church." Also openly attacked us?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cass mouth smirked and said casually: "The so-called wanted, you really have this thing." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having heard this, Duke and Steven were filled with incredible feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it true that there is nothing to do with the March church and their wanted allies! ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly thought of this, this suddenly let two people burst into a cold sweat on their foreheads, instantly reminded of countless horror things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the March church colludes with people’s perceived heresy, then what so many so-called heresy is killed before the church! ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嘶嘶嘶! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two men took a breath of cold air and shuddered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When two people were thinking about it, Kas turned his head and looked out the door of the living room and said, "Okay, come in! Everyone understands people, Some things are better to say in person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing this, a cold wind blew, and the large living room door was blown away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside, there are more than twenty people standing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These people are led by female warlocks, surrounded by members of cult organizations such as the Cold Church and the Institute of Polar Studies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader is a woman who is about forty years old and looks like an ugly female warlock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This female warlock is wearing a worn black robe with white hair and a quirky black spot on her face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After coming in, the pair of viper-like triangle eyes fell on the body of Iyeta, with a sinister voice in his mouth: "Iyeta Your courage is really big enough. Not only do you defect, but you dare to confuse your compatriots."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just let them see the wider world, To embrace a better life." Ieta courageously, hard to fight back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When speaking, more than twenty people have surrounded the entire hall and surrounded them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard the words of Iyeta, the black-skinned warlock’s face was black and suddenly waved, and the strange shadows rushed over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This shadow is very fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even when no one else reacted, a loud slap in the face slammed on Ieta’s face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very heavy fight. I will play back two steps and even feel dizzy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader of the cold-hearted church standing beside the female warlock, the moustache man squinted at the four people and licked his lips and said, "If you can." I want her tongue to taste, such a mouth that can be said, the tongue will be delicious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black-spotted warlock grinning Sound: "It's a good note."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she finished, she set her eyes on the other three female warlocks, faintly said: "Hey now I still Don't change your mind, immediately roll me back! So you are still qualified to be a slave to venting. Otherwise, waiting for you will be the eternal torture of soul hell."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;When I heard this, the three female warlocks had just had some gods' eyes and expressions, and they were so scared and white, and the body shivered, seemingly thinking of something unspeakable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as the three female warlocks were about to collapse, a voice full of anger sounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are a group of cults who are brave! This is the manor of the Hausmann family! Whoever allows you to come in!" Duke's momentum at this time Full of anger, angry at everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this voice, the surrounding cultists suddenly gave a sneer sneer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you really think that two dollars are great? If we want, it’s easy to kill everyone in your family!" Weird tattoos, like a certain shaman-like middle-aged man replies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Duke’s face suddenly pale, mysterious, he has seen it, the inhuman means that completely violates scientific common sense, definitely not theirs An ordinary person can defend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Exactly! Kill all of you today!" The shaman middle-aged man took out a weird bone knife and took a step forward. Say: "You should have a lot of mysterious and related treasures in your hands. It is a waste in your hands."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not talk nonsense, my time is not More." The black-spotted warlock said, leading a group of people to the front and narrowing the encirclement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In essence, they still have to live. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because for others, there is no warning for death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Say, did you forget someone?" Suddenly a voice rang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of everyone suddenly fell on the person who made the sound, Kas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I thought you were going to be a tortoise, and the church in the late hours was just like this. It’s a joke to send you a waste." Of course, the warlock did not ignore Kas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, this time, their imaginary enemy is the reinforcement of the church in the late bell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, what she did not think was that the reinforcements of the church in the late bells were only one person, and it was a seemingly ordinary expert mystery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the way, she even thought about some fighting strategies, but now it is no longer necessary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Kas calmly smiled, and the gentleman replied: "I am waiting for the existence of the church in the late night. You can know this kind of garbage. I don't know who is fearless." I can forgive you for being rude now. People won't be angry because a bug is called."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear this, the face of the blackboard warlock Instantly gloomy: "You are looking for death!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, the black shadow appears again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal of this is Kas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cass was prepared this time, and his body turned sharply, and easily escaped the shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Kas was ready to go back and fight back, the shadow suddenly burst out of the ground and entangled Kas’s body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"About Shadow Knowledge, Secret Law, Shadow Master." As a former bloody traveler, Kas knows a lot of knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is still a lot to know, but unfortunately, you are dying soon." The black-spotted warlock said indifferently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cas is still calm, quite the calm and calm look of Su Ge. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, the vast majority of believers in the church throughout the night are imitating Suguena’s calm and calm appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, the Zhongren adults are the idols of many believers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pinch the body of Kas, the black-spotted warlock turned his head and looked at Iyer and others: "Is this your backing? Now I am Let you know, let's play against us!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, the black-spotted warlock suddenly turned back: "What else is there?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cass sighed: "Should you have any last words? Don't you feel something wrong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;When I heard this, the black-skinned warlock suddenly felt a tight heart, and the eyes swept around in an instant, and the small incense burner that was on the coffee table was emitting green smoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's it!" The black-skinned warlock's eyes tightened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I first came in, the corner of her eyes saw that the ordinary incense burner had just been ignited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While she was teaching the traitors, this Kass sat leisurely and was unmoved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This action directly draws her attention from the incense burner to the body of Kas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hold your mouth!" The black spotted warlock suddenly screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first reaction to seeing smoke is to cover your mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because she used this smoke as a poisonous gas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cass laughed haha: "Do not worry, this is not a poisonous poison, just a kind of soul-scented."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"An Soul!!" I heard everyone here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night long dreams, come here, the black-spotted warlock no longer has the intention of killing the chicken and the monkey, the shadow is instantly tightened, and the body of Kas is completely deformed. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the strange situation appeared, and the deformed Kas did not die, but turned into a strange mist from the black-spoted warlock. control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even after leaving the control, float directly in the air, slowly raise your hands and sing loudly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The storm that tears the sky is the battleship of my Lord, and the darkness of the stars is the light of my Lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body is the redeemer of the kingdom of death, and its god is the holder of the world will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fog of the wild spirit and the abyss link is the boundary of my god country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aura of the cold wind and the ghost ghost are the sons of my master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord's Divine Power does not have to be warm, not merciful, no mercy, no sympathy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The true belief is to pass on knowledge, to spread hope, to redeem, and to break the beacon of despair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord of Greatness, the faith of your servant, the fate of your servant, the life of your servant, and the knowledge of your servants are in this fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battleship of the storm is the cutting edge of the world! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foggy wolf is the bridge to life and death! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hoarfrost warriors are the ecstasy of illusion and reality! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Show it! My Lord is Shenwei! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come on! My Lord is a knight! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the sing of Cass, others don’t know if it’s an illusion, and the temperature in the entire space drops rapidly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calling...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gust of cold wind does not know where it appears, Wreaked throughout the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is in a dream!" At this time, an expert female warlock who is very proficient in dreams said loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dream! What kind of dream?" The black-spotted warlock hurriedly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's a totally public dream, it's about the real world, and we all have no control over this dream, including that guy!" Pointed to Cass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, Kas fell from the sky, confirming the words of the female warlock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moustache male smiled and said: "What is the use of pulling us into this space? You are still a waste!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ieta and the three female warlocks on the side saw that it was completely stupid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long prayers, they thought that there would be any special effects, I did not expect that it was just creating a dream space, and I could not control it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is simply incredible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dead." The bone knife in the middle of the shaman middle-aged man suddenly slammed into a skeleton bone bag and bite at Kas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's over!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this scene, Iyeta four people are pale, one Desperate face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗖! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, the skull was suddenly hit by something less than a meter in front of Cass, and then nailed firmly to the ground. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people were shocked first, hurriedly looking, just seeing one The gray spear will pierce the skull and nail it firmly to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time the horrible ice spread quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咔嚓...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the crisp cracking sound, the skull became awkward A pile of crystal fragments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cass unfolded his arms, and he said with enthusiasm and sincerity: "The foolish and ignorant person! Of course, my humble existence cannot control this great space." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he finished, he shouted: "Now! Witness the lord of my Lord!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ; Hey! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another meteor-like spear cut through the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
