			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this character, there are some weird priests, and Su Ge is very interested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not eager to take this priest into the church, but is only interested in his character and thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, Su Ge suddenly asked: "You just said that the two clergymen were eaten by the devil?"<br /><br /> Father Cinna nodded: "Well, from the traces left, it should be the shadow devil, although that thing needs 51 points to see, but if it is from the abyss If you tame and summon it, you can ignore the system of vision."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge asks: "Who did it, do you have a clue?" Father Cagne shook his head: "I don't know too well. The most suspected ancient sensation, performed yesterday, has sufficient evidence of absence. At the same time, it is strict." He is not a mystery."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge listened to his heart, and then he was sure that the murderer was an accident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, he was a little surprised, because the eyes of Father Sini, he could not see the identity of the ancient sense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Father Sini’s evaluation of Su Ge, Su Ge did not have any image to tell him the identity of the mysterious person, and said: “I I heard that there are many cults in the capital city today. It is estimated that the two wastes have offended anyone in the unconscious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sini nodded: "The estimate is, But since I mentioned this, do you know the identity and reason of the mysterious person who followed you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger said casually: "If nothing unexpected, it should It is the person of the Institute of Polar Studies. For the reason, it must be because I have some special breath on the ship."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard this priest Hey, then asked: "Are you on the Saroni?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well." Su Ge nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The cultists of the Cthulhu Order, and the fog that you did?" Father Sini followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge did not deny, saying: "Since it is encountered, naturally, they cannot be allowed to do things like this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Father Cagnes exclaimed: "I really didn't look at the wrong person, I didn't ask for fame and fortune, I didn't ask for a return. This kind of person is really rare now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Suger said with a wry smile: "You don't have to flatter me. I am a taboo because of the church. It's too high-profile."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sini The priest nodded. "But this is also very great."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, the two people lifted the bottle at the same time, touched it, and sipped. A big mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The priest came over this time, there should be no other things." Su Ge then cut into the theme. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge does not think that this guy came over in the middle of the night, just to complain with himself, and show off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French Sini laughed: "Surely you can't hold you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you can I hope that you can help me monitor and deal with the cultists in the city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let me handle?" Su Ge stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French Sini is a martyr who hates iron and is not a steel: "It is impossible to expect those wastes to eradicate cultists. There are too many interests involved here." I have always wanted to dispose of those disgusting guys, but my identity is too conspicuous."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Holy Blood Church should not sit idly by?" Asked Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, this is the foot of the emperor, the top of the head is the star heaven, the nearest place to the goddess. Father Cagnes laughed and said: "Those who are tall are studying imaginary things all day, never caring about what's going on. The bottom and middle layers are already rotten. This time.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly the accident, the whole operational ability ills are all highlighted."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I personally hope that they will look at their ugliness and ridicule them. But those cults are too arrogant, trampling on the dignity of the goddess in such a sacred place. I am intolerant of being a purple moon." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge heard this and found that although Father Sini was an upright cynic, his mind was still limited by his strength and identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temptations of the cultists are not at all provoke the dignity of the goddess, but to test the old behemoth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, what do you need me to do?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French Sini proposes his own plan: "I know your inconvenience in the capital, so I can provide you with shelter and let you go back and forth without worrying about the church. Interference. And you only need to kill the cultists I can't kill."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It sounds easy." Su Ge said easily. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French Sini looked at Su Ge’s deep eyes and said, “Of course, this is not free. I’ll give you a deal. The secret of the church that can satisfy your curiosity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Su Ge was heartbroken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let me think about it. After all, I am not planning to expose myself this time." Su Ge did not directly agree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French Sini then drunk the last bit of wine and got up and said: "Of course, you have plenty of time to think about it. If you think about it, you can go straight. Go to the Ten Victory Gate and find me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said, he turned and walked toward the door: "Of course, I believe you won't let me wait too long." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge followed and stood up to send him out, watching him squatting at the cultists, his body lightly disappearing into the night sky, with a smile on his lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is the refuge of Father Sini, it will be much easier for him to deal with the problem of the female warlock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turn off the lights and go back to sleep in the bedroom, just to see Shirley standing on the edge of the window, watching the three rounds of the moon in the sky a bit fascinating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soft moonlight ran down the window on her face, and the perfect face was enchanted by the ethereal and cold, like the scent of the fireworks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you looking at?" Sug walked over and hugged her from behind her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley’s voice calmly asked: “What do you think of the three moons?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Su Ge looked up and looked at it. These three moons are no different from the moon of the earth except the color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Like a bread?" asked Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley heard this and couldn’t help but laugh out: “Giggle, it’s a barren thinking.”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you look like?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley’s slightly side-faced, cold-speaking: “An ugly and disgusting monster.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Su Ge’s heart seems to have thought of something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪嗒! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vision suddenly rose a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This rise suddenly makes Su Ge jump in his heart, rushing to stabilize his mind and not thinking too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not that he doesn’t want to think about it, but he doesn’t dare to think about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the horror behind it, it cannot be described. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At last, I’m a bit open, under my constant enlightenment and education.” Shelly said, turning around, enchantingly putting the peach-shaped giant chest On Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looked at this beautiful beauty, and immediately came to the mood, hand in her clothes, and grabbed the big surprise Peach: "That please ask the teacher to educate me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take your performance." Shirley flirts with temptation The heat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
