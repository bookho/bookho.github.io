			<div id="content"><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge, under the guidance of two white sorcerers, walked down the narrow stairs to the conference room on the second floor and found many people here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some acquaintances, first of all, Rogan, Marx, Bobby, three night patrols, followed by Father Hank, guarding the library's Father Water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These five people are sitting on the left side of the prototype conference table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a lot of strength on the right side. From the clothes, it is a figure of five bishops, and it is not the bishop’s priests in the past few days, but just came today. Bishop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the middle of the front, Archbishop Emilia has taken off her hat, her mouth is smiling, and she looks at Su Ge with kindness and peace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After entering, Su Ge took the lead in bowing, and the tone was full of respect and respect: "Bern Holy Blood Church, Purple Moon Walker, Su Gesuo Toss has seen the Archbishop, and the goddess of the goddess is always with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the respectful tone of Su Ge, the standard posture, the five bishops nodded slightly I bowed down and wrote something on the book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emilia sends out her unique and nice voice: "Get up and sit down, the goddess' good boy."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your grace, thank the goddess for your care." Su Ge put his hands on his chest and crossed his face, his face was piously finished, his body was slightly sloppy, he took the first three steps and sat in that Relatively simple wooden chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emeria whispered: "About this incident, Mr. Rogan and Father Hank have already told me, I am also with Walter. The priest made a relevant confirmation, but I still want you to explain in detail what happened and how you met Luke Sainz."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Luke Sainz? Is it Mr. Luke?" asked Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes." Emilia nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge will sit straight on the waist and look solemn: "Okay, I will try to say this in detail from the beginning to the end." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge’s voice just fell, and the five bishops on the left waved at the same time. Five invisible rays shrouded the body of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge knows that this is a small spell for lie detection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The source of this matter is also to start from the ghost ship incident a few months ago."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Slowly, in this matter, we have reserved ample time." Emilia sounds lighter and lighter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded and started his own explanation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After the ghost ship incident, I accidentally met a merchant of the League of Legends, who called Bart Inbas. At the time he and the owner of the bakery There was a dispute. Because I understood the language of the Allied Empire and helped him to get rid of it, he was very happy to let me be his temporary guide. When he was sent to live, a person named Jike came out to pick him up." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And coincidentally, this jike was kidnapped by three people who claimed to be the Green Flame Brotherhood, because of the sect of the death sect. For this reason, I feel that this thing seems to be somewhat unusual, but it is not accurate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, what?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have been paying attention to this matter until after the circus killing..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug Truthfully, the whole process is said to be true, but I have not said a few things that I don't want to manage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those things like witches, such as gatherings, such as the church in the evening,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The painter here, Su Ge, synthesizes two things. Su Ge escaped after being found to be attacked. It was Bart who saved him and briefly said the division of the Green Flame Brotherhood. After that, Su Ge went back to this. The matter was told to Master Geros. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't know how to develop afterwards, but when I chased the cold-hearted church ghoul that night, I heard some sounds, you should know, in In terms of sound, I have some natural talents. Through dialogue, I know that they were invited by a mysterious person. The event of the ghost ship is only to attract attention. And the mysterious human rights are very huge, he can easily mobilize the police. It is even easy to transfer the priest who investigated the matter. Finally, even at the crucial moment, the master of Gerlos was transferred, which made me very scared. At that time, I began to disbelieve anyone, and kept this secret. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five priests heard this nod, and the process was exactly the same as that of everyone, including Jerous, who was far from the center of the Holy See. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After I was afraid to join the church and study hard. I discovered the problem of Markock and solved the problem of the baby with Mr. Rogan. We discovered the larvae of the giant worm, and I began to wonder more, especially that Markock’s suicide in the church made me more fearful and cautious.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After I was performing my mission for the first time, I heard that there was a madman in the mountain when I killed a bloody bat. I met the madman in the process of execution. At that time, the madman had long red hair, and he started. There was some crazy attack on me, but after a burst of bells, he suddenly returned to normal, he is Mr. Luke."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop! You said The bell kept his spirit back to normal?" Emilia's silver brow wrinkled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where is the bell coming?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not very clear." Su Ge's face was confused and spread his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't really know the principle of the bell." Su Ge added. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five bishops nodded slightly and continued to bow down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This matter is exactly the same as that of the village head of Laihua Village. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After I met a missionary..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge said nothing later Concealing is straightforward and straightforward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because everything is normal here, nothing deserves to be hidden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When we and Roland were investigating, most of those who committed suicide were Bishop Ron, or the mayor of Mayor Arno."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why don't you report such an important message?" a middle-aged bishop whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
