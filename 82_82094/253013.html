			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After half an hour, three battles, Su Ge lost in the third game with a slight gap of two points, a reluctant face The banknotes in hand are handed over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The victory is a pleasure, but after the victory, the reality is still the same, you have to face it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The youth took a moment of silence after taking the paper money, and suddenly burst into silence, completely without the attitude that the winner should have. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looked at him and sighed: "I heard about your business. The problem with this matter is not with you. You must be strong." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The youth wiped the tears on his face and whispered: "No, I am incompetent. I can't find my child. She left me." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge gave him a glass of wine at this time and asked casually: "Is there not a lot of troops here? Didn't you ask them for help?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man drank this big glass of wine and whispered: "They? Since the beginning of the civil war, this group of guys wandered around the mountain all day, saying It is to prevent thieves from smuggling from the borders of the mountains and destroying domestic stability. How can they have time to control the lives of our civilians?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug sees the youth already I opened my mouth and asked, "I want to go to the capital city to find some suppliers of aquatic products. I think you are so calm here, is it the capital city?" The battle is over?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man listened to his mouth with a hint of mockery: “End? It’s so good, the situation on the other side of the city is not over. There is no possibility of any reconciliation on either side, unless it is the first to fall, it will not end."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your country is really strange, the country It’s all like this. You’re still so peaceful here, even the soldiers are not too slow, have time to drink here.” Su Ge whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three soldiers have not left yet, and Su Ge does not want to draw their attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man grabbed Suge’s collar and his eyes blurred and said: “Look at the face where your skills are good, I will give you a piece of advice. Those soldiers are far away..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The youth seemed to drink too much at this time, and he said on the table intermittently: "I feel the disappearance of my son... It seems that they are related to...the group of beasts..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Hearing these words, Su Ge determined that these soldiers did have some problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""Guarding the mountains? Even the reason for this peace is because they want to protect what is in the mountains?" Su Ge eyes swept away on three people After, give up the youth who slept and others to drink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more harsh the environment, the more optimistic people are, and the warmth of the Guinness Kingdom, which is as cold as the city of Bain, is very enthusiastic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sugg is easy to mingle with them under the influence of alcohol, but Su Ge suddenly suffered a cold rejection when he intended to understand the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Outsiders, if you are a passing businessman, we welcome you, but if you are someone who doesn't use your heart, we will expel you directly!" It’s just the big man who is so strong, Jim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge listened to his usual look and grinned: "Don't get me wrong, I'm just more curious. Don't worry, I am a real businessman, tomorrow. After finishing it, I will leave this place to the capital city the day after tomorrow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this person nodded slightly and continued the happy atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two hours later, Su Ge was violently vomiting behind the pub. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After giving a self-hypnosis and meditation, it was a stun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wiped the mouth with a handkerchief, and Sug turned to look at the rolling hills on the east side of the town, with shimmering eyes: "Guinness is not Big, if someone really has a layout, it can easily spread the whole bureau all over the country. The quiet here is a little unusual, and the locals are tight-lipped about this, and only the drunken youth has said something useful."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since the doubts point to there, look at the past." Su Ge finished, picking up his cane and preparing to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a voice suddenly remembered: "You are not a businessman, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge smiled, turned his head as usual, just saw that The sad youth stares at herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Do you have any questions? If not, I have to go back to the hotel first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The young man’s face was awkward, and then he tempted to ask: “I know that you are interested in the internal situation of this country. If you are willing to help me find my child, I am willing to share everything I know.” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s heart moved, his eyes gradually sharpened a lot on him, smiling: “I think we are very close to each other, are interested in changing a place to talk?” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." The youth is nodding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s hotel room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are simple arrangements around, and two people sit opposite each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your insight is really good." Su Ge said first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man’s face showed a bitter smile: “I was a lawyer before. Oh! My name is Cody Huntington.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can call me Su Ge," Su Ge said casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cody asked: "So Mr. Su Ge, are you willing to help me find my son?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Suge did not rush to answer, sitting down and said: "Mr. Huntington, you should be aware that all transactions need to be equal to each other, I need what you know is worth making me risk looking for your son. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cody pinched his hand and whispered, "I know some things in the mountains. I feel that these situations are related to the disappearance of my son." You will feel interested."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
