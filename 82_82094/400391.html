What are you doing here?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge listened to his brow slightly and asked with interest: "How do you see that I am not a local?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Feeling, the extravagance on your body is too heavy, and does not match the atmosphere here." Charlie organized the language and answered carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug is somewhat curious: "What is the atmosphere here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Active struggle "Charlie replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg thought about the special temperament on the faces of the surrounding residents when he came all the way. It’s very kind of when he was on Earth, the big city A sense of life in rhythm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this Su Ge’s face said: “You’re pretty accurate.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Charlie had already leaned over during the conversation. He looked at the black suit of Su Ge’s self-cultivation but did not dare to reach out. The heart said: "The materials and crafts of this dress are high-grade goods. If this is because the misunderstanding is dirty, I can pay this wage. Can't afford it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr., should you have nothing hidden here?" Charlie asked very straight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge was teased by his awkwardly cute, and said, "Are you responsible for the patrol of this film?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charles nodded and looked around carefully, thinking that there was no mass destruction in the clothes that Sugna fits right, and relaxed and vigilantly said: "Are you lost? If you want to leave the city, I can send you out of the city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge puts his hand: "I don't go out of town, just want to find my home." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your home?" Charlie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge casually said: "I am a native of Bain. I left here more than half a year ago to develop my career outside. This time I came back and found the old house and The structure of the block has changed and some are not suitable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Charlie heard it, he then asked, "Where did you live before?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"421 421 Maple Street." Su Ge said his home address. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Charlie listened to his heart and put away his gun and said: "Ah! It’s not far from here. This half year in the Archbishop of Emilia Under the guidance, the surrounding suburbs have been re-planned and remodeled. Maple Street and Yujin Street have now been linked together. The former three-story apartment has now become a brand new five-storey apartment, right there. I will lead you in the past!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge nodded happily. Two people walked side by side to the dead end. Su Ge asked: "The law and order under the rule of the Archbishop should have been very good. You have just been so nervous. How do you feel that the recent law and order does not seem to be good?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie sighed and replied: "It is true that Bain City is much safer under the rule of the Archbishop, but recently I don’t know what happened. The underlying criminal cases suddenly increased a lot. A few days ago In the vicinity, two pedestrians suddenly became mad and attacked other people. There are also some people who are sneaking and seemingly looking for something."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Oh? Who are some people?" Su Ge asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All..." Charlie replied with a word, but he could open his mouth and think of something. The positive color said: "This is confidential, you are not It's easy to know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge didn't ask, looking at the crowds around him, his eyes swept away and seemed to see something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turning his head and looking at it, I found that a mouse that is about the size of a kitten is now on the fruit of a trader, and the human face on his face looks around. Around, it seems to be looking for something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Human face rat?" Su Ge had some surprises. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The human face rat as a new type of Dai, which was just discovered in the Guinness Kingdom, did not know how much it was at first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the past six months, when Su Ge and others continued to capture the remaining human face of the Lord of the Moon, after thorough testing, they found that they wanted to see people. The critical spirit of the face rat is regarded as 25 points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It means that it is a second-order Yi, and the water ghost is a hierarchy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this, Sug turned and asked: "You just said that someone suddenly went crazy recently, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, it’s scary. After the man went crazy, he couldn’t die. Fortunately, the exorcist was rushed in time to surrender it.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Speaking of this, Charlie sighed in a bad mood: "Because of these several things, my vision has been six o'clock."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Su Ge listened and turned to the fruit stand, and the face mouse standing on the melon was now aware of Su Ge's view. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the moment of seeing Su Ge, the mouth of the man’s face suddenly opened, revealing sharp fangs and rushing directly toward Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge randomly lifted his right hand with black leather gloves and pinched the rat that was rushing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The human face mouse caught by Su Ge struggled desperately, his mouth full of fangs biting at the mouth of Su Ge’s tiger, but found that he was completely bitten move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold flame of the palm flashed past, and the struggling human face mouse instantly turned into a hard ice sculpture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie looked at Su Ge’s action at this time, his face was a little surprised: “What are you doing?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He can't see the human face, but you can see that Su Ge's palm is open and seems to hold something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled: "Nothing, I saw a bug, and I shot it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Charlie did not dare to ask, with Su Ge walking about 50 meters, turn left from a cross street: "This is 421 Maple Street."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge looked at it, the old and broken houses were gone, and the two sides were replaced by white roofs, red brick walls, clean and tidy five-story apartments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What should I do with my original house here?" Su Ge asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie immediately said: "The house here has been redistributed. If there is a house here, you can not only live in a new house, but also get an additional compensation house of the same size as before."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about the house?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know this, you need to go to the city to check it out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Thank you, the enthusiastic policeman." Su Ge smiled with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie hurriedly waved: "Should, it should. Then you are busy first, I am leaving."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, turn and leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge looked down at the human face rat in his hand and opened the vision to sweep around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he saw a very secretive spiritual mark behind Charlie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This imprint has no substantial harm, but it is like a token, always telling the releaser his position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Seeing is the fate, who let me see it?" Su Ge said as he walked behind Charlie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie helped Su Ge seem to be in a good mood, with a small song in his mouth, continue his patrol. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he was walking through a block, he suddenly saw a gray robe wearing a traveler, and a woman wearing a worn hood could not kneel on the floor, body The violent tremor seems to have suffered a lot of pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie hurried forward and kneel down to help her ask: "This lady, are you okay!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman continues to bow her head, her body trembles more intensely but does not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ms.!?" Charlie bowed her head and tried to judge her current situation by the way she looked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, just as he bowed his head, the woman turned her head slowly...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The look that looked at Charlie was pale, and he shouted and screamed and sat down on the floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the body under the woman’s clothes began to stir vigorously, as if something had broken out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;噗嗤! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next second,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two are full of blood, like the legs of some animal Something stretched out the woman's back and grew out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of blood is splashing around, the scene is very strange and bloody. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The residents around the city saw this suddenly messed up and fled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie took the pistol all the time and trembled, whispering: "No... no movement!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The woman slowly raised her head and could see that her face was no longer visible. She was surprised by scales, hair, rotten sores, bloody covering, and even eyes and mouth could not be seen, twisted It makes people sick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪嗒! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Charlie's eyes are full of bloodshot eyes, and the vision suddenly grows again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hungry..." The woman couldn’t stand up, her limbs crawling on the ground, and at the moment there were two sarcoma-like heads, each There is an eye on the head, which makes the scalp numb and the spirit collapse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Complete..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of such a scene, Charlie was completely scared, I don’t dare to move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, the monster has climbed to the front of Charlie, the woman’s head slammed back and forth, and a disgusting big grows from the neck. mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪叽,啪叽<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
