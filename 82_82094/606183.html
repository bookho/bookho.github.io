			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of these deep dives, Su Ge suddenly opened the iron umbrella in his hand and blocked it in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the huge force that the bullet hits on it makes it difficult for Su Ge to improve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, it is even more shocking for Su Ge, these deep dive people, in addition to automatic rifles, actually have iron mesh that can be ejected, and projected fish Fork gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Su Ge’s gaze, these deep-dividers are comparable to the most elite special forces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of the fire suppression, the left side of the Su Ge spray iron mesh, while the right side of the Su Ge shot of the harpoon gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, the snorkeler who had a beard had a few words in his mouth, and I don’t know that there were a lot of tentacles from there. Wrapped around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of such an attack, Su Ge really gave up the battle, holding the iron umbrella and then retreating, then a big wave, the fog around him, his The body is covered up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, the two backs left by Su Ge have been completely docked, creating a very dense fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of this fog, visibility is even less than half a meter, standing in it makes people feel very lonely and helpless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tick! Tick! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rain in the house is slowly falling. The heavy rain in the sky has stopped, it seems that the fog completely separates the statue and the weather has temporarily returned to normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge licked the numb palm of his hand and retreated to Shirley’s side and said, “Let’s go, these deep dive are not very good now. Handling."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You put them here?" Xuelier asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge shook his head slightly: "They are not aggressive, the main purpose is to guard the statue. Now Albert should have given them to Macock. I was rescued. In the face of this kind of attack, I have no way to deal with it. Albert, who has the power system ability, is a good helper."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your means should not be so poor," said Shirley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sogra lived in her hand and said in the fog: "I am implementing my settings now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fog is really very big, at this time the room has been followed, and the windows have penetrated all corners of the ship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even at this time the hall has been covered by fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people on the ground have a sense of fortunes and security after being surrounded by the fog, as if a scared child is hiding in a place where peace of mind The corner is relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's the matter!?" When the people were at ease, the cultists suddenly fell into a panic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no fog in their plans, and this fog is really weird. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The summoning ceremony was destroyed, and a difficult guy came." At this moment, Marchie's voice came from the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, the people on the ground suddenly felt alive, and then I thought of the hero who was just brave and confident: Drake Mr. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Drake is really too strong."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't say Mr. Drake Is it the clergy of the church?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is possible that the church must know that these cultists are ready in advance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In any case, Mr. Drake saved our lives."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People are looking at this time Grateful whisper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a dozen cultists here looking in the general direction. The gloomy youth asked: "What should I do? High priest?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Markey said calmly: "The guy is not expected to escape the coffers of these elite deep dive, and now can only advance the taboo banquet."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The high priest, this fog is too big, I can't find your place! What to do!!" A cultist looked around and asked helplessly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Markey said calmly: "Keep it in place and not move."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She walked along the road in memory to the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The direct killing of these people is useless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Markey’s plan is to let these people fall into frenzy after the arrival of the Son of God, gather enough crazy souls, and then bring the rest of the people into the dream, as Nourish the nourishment of the Son of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the development of the Son of God, you can launch the power of the god of dreams, envelop the entire ship, devour everyone, and complete development. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, now, Marchi has determined that part of the power of the great true God has entered the body of the Son of God, and that the Son of God has been bred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Son of God is not born because of a strange obstacle, and this huge fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She can only bring these people into a frenzied state in advance, offering a crazy soul, so that the Son of God can get enough power to succeed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this kind of god will be relatively weak, but this is the only way now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because she is faintly aware, this fog is not ordinary, it is likely to come to another powerful god who is not inferior to Cthulhu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While these cultists were preparing for the ceremony, Su Ge walked in silently, relying on the detection of the night bell to find a cultist close to the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Silently walked behind him, reaching out and covering his mouth, the sword in his hand had cut his neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;! ! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several people on the ground who are seeing this moment, their eyes wide open and their expressions are extremely excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge smiled and put the body down, then made a sly gesture, indicating that they should not move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people saw the little chicken nodded and looked excited and happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unsettledly solved one, Su Ge went to the second place not far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still a cold flash, accompanied by the death of a cult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While Su Ge is preparing to kill the third, the flesh-and-blood monsters not far away seem to have sensed the presence of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a slamming, the awkward pace rushed directly toward Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of this monster, Su Ge’s body suddenly rushed forward, and a punch was silently placed on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a heavy downfall, the bones of its limbs were shattered directly and could no longer be moved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Enemy!" Hearing this voice, other cultists suddenly shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marckon was shocked and then continued to whisper as he moved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since it was discovered, Su Ge was not a slow assassination, a sword, and Su Ge’s body rushed out like a leopard, relying on late Zhong Yubo's positioning, easily found a few cultists in the vicinity, one sword, killing three in one minute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who! Where are you! Where are you!" The remaining cultists were frightened and pale at this time, gathering together back to back, pinching The weapon of the tight hand trembles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don’t blame me, I’m welcome!!” said the gloomy face youth, grabbing a hand in his hand and then blowing the flames in him. The hands rise and rise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hot flame seems to dispel some fog, and everything is getting clearer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The whole hall is burned!" The gloomy face youth is threatened to throw out the fireball in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
