			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge lay on the ground for the past five minutes before gradually returning to normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The release of the late bells, Su Ge felt a very strange spiritual barrier around the Holy Grail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This physic barrier separates the Holy Grail from the real world. Although the Holy Grail has come to earth, it still has no connection with the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This barrier is deliberately made, both as a kind of protection and a kind of imprisonment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking out, the person who imposed this barrier does not want the Holy Grail to come to the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge stood up and patted the dust on his body, then moved his body to make sure that his body was only temporarily paralyzed, and he was careful to be close to the Holy Grail after he was not injured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The barrier is small, like a shell for a gift. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it is small, it is extremely strong, without any flaws and defects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Su Ge frowned and fell into deep meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your movements are faster than I thought."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, that The enchanting voice came again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looked up and found that the entire space was swallowed up by the infinite darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In those dark walls around, Su Ge can see countless horror monsters squirming inside, and from time to time, he looks out at the cold and looks at himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these things, Su Ge is no stranger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, he has seen it many times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley's black robe hunting fell from the sky, the perfect thigh that loomed under the black robe, so that Su Ge saw a sudden rippling heart, then rushed to use the night bell , stable mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How? Ready to snatch the Holy Grail?" Su Ge did not dare to look at her, turned to look at the Holy Grail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley twisted the seductive waist and took a catwalk to the side of Su Ge and said, "This is a conceptual barrier, if this layer of concept barriers If it is broken, the concept of the Holy Grail will be confirmed in this world, and it will not be able to be called by other people to other time and other space."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge glanced at her and asked, "You seem to have another way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course." Shelly said first, then the voice took a trace Be wary: "But the cost is huge, and most of my powers are no longer available for some reason."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled: "Cute, I Also."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley gave him a blank look, with a hint of temper in his tone: "It's as if your power was once used in reality. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough, at least once in a while, can be used." Su Ge said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley’s eyebrows are not good: “Can the right to kill my child? Also use my name as a stepping stone to help you make a name for yourself?” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough and cough..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug Cough is even more powerful, a face awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When looking at Su Ge’s embarrassed look, Shirley’s Yingying’s eyes had a smile, then she went to the Holy Grail and said, “I can help you get rid of this. A layer of conceptual barriers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s heart was not happy, but was full of vigilance and asked: “What are your requirements?”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley’s eyes narrowed and said, “I need you to lend me something.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"secret."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you borrow my body parts, or life, I don't agree." Su Ge immediately shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley stretched out his white fingers and shook: "I am not interested in your life and parts, but you are other. Rest assured, for you Life has no effect on your church and on your friends."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge brows deeper: "Can the world have such a good thing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirle continues: "Of course not only this, after you get the Holy Grail of the Soul, this is not yours, but two of us." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You obviously have this ability, why not take it yourself, but let me take it?" Su Ge is more vigilant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley is somewhat unhappy: "Are you stupid, or stupid?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge heard this and continued to silence, did not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl’s tone of hate is not steel, saying: “The Holy Grail can recognize our essence and allow us to get close. But don’t forget, we are now After all, the flesh is still the human body. There is no way to truly contact the Holy Grail and preserve the Holy Grail."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After hearing this, Su Ge thought a second, his eyes instantly It fell on the black glove of his right hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black gloves are life outside the field and can help Su Ge touch a lot of things he can't touch. This is the attribute of the original body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, he thought of the strengthening and increase of Shirley’s gloves by Jerez. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the slightly raised mouth of the hand, it seems that you can embed a thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!" Shelly looked at Su Ge’s movements, her hands clasped her chest, and turned her head and looked cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger finally understood at this time, and secretly said: "It turns out that she has been chasing my core purpose because I can’t get the Holy Grail, only through this Black gloves can take the Holy Grail!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Su Ge’s heart was relieved, because he finally knew the purpose of Shirley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes!" Su Ge agreed very quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl also seems to know that Su Ge will not lie to himself, strolling to the altar and raising his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, a burst of incomparably dark power appeared along her hands and hit the outer shell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, the darkness of the surrounding has also extended countless dark beams of light on the outer shell of the Holy Grail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the horrible energy of the horror continues to spread, canceling each other and disappearing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s eyes wide open, and he clearly felt that the thickness of the outer shell was rapidly thinning in the darkness that was full of corrosion and distortion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, a burst of black cracks appeared on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Su Ge’s unexpected discovery, the power of Shelly quickly dissipated, and her mask also showed the same crack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point in time, it seems that the two concepts are colliding and are offsetting each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the last two minutes, with a roar, the huge energy wave directly knocked two people out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless indescribable ray bursts that envelope the entire dark space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s still true that these lights are blocked by the darkness, and after a violent walk, they gradually return to the glorious holy grail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger’s face was very pale at this time, and the energy of the Holy Grail of the Soul was whizzing through his body several times, not only making his mind not only, but also upset Even the psionics are completely sucked out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He struggled to sit up, just to see that Shirley was not far from his own, and he was getting hard to get up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conceptual barrier to neutralize her consumption is terrible, Suger found that Shirley seems to have lost a lot of things at this time, her breath, her Psionic, her knowledge is not as strong as before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For almost a moment, she turned from an imposing dark queen to a charming woman who looked very weak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you okay!?" Su Ge was not injured, but he stood up smartly and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl's black hair was scattered all over the place, and as she slowly looked up, the mask on her face fell with a black breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she saw her mask fall off, Suger suddenly jumped in her heart, and then the messy spirit was driven by intense curiosity, and the body was close to the past uncontrollably. I want to see what it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Suge walked over, Shirley’s delicate body slowly stood up and smoothed his hair, when Shirley looked up, Su Stupid, completely stupid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This...this...nothing!" Su Ge’s eyes widened, his face was astonished and unbelievable, and his body suddenly stepped back. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing countless strange events, countless horror, he can't accept this Shirley at this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shelly’s sexy red lips slightly cocked, with a glamorous smile on her face, “Why is this horrible thing exposed? I don’t look scared. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, she said one step forward: "And, in your mind, my appearance should be the most beautiful and perfect existence in the world." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge's eyes are filled with large pieces of bloodshot, screaming, and the vision has grown by 5 points and came to 58 points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are you?!" Su Ge turned his face and twisted, shouting at Sherry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge thinks that there is only one woman who is the most perfect and beautiful, then Ada. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shelley did not make a mistake, because she... is exactly the same as Ada! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only two people whose temperament is the opposite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Ada’s temperament is the most holy, the most sacred, the most thought-provoking, and the inner good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then Shirley is the most temperamental temperament, the most embarrassing, the most devastating, the inner evil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two are exactly the same, they are so perfect and beautiful, like the goddess of mythology, but it gives a diametrically contrasting . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley seems to be very satisfied with Su Ge’s appearance at this time, calmly replied: "My full name is, Shirley Newton."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;! ! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge listened, his expression was sluggish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Su Ge feels that the brain is blank. All his self-righteous speculations about Sherry are not established at this time, and can even be said to be the road lip. Not right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has dealt a huge blow to Su Ge’s spirit and confidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, Su Ge’s difficult return to God, the voice hoarse and weakly asked: “Who are you?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a long story, do you want to listen?" Xue Lier came over and asked with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s nodded his head: “I want to listen, tell me the truth, the real truth.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sheryl said, walking along the body to the altar, while walking, said: "That was twenty years ago, the people of the Institute of Polar Studies carried out a huge sacrifice ceremony, summoned by the lives of six villagers. There is a great existence, people call him the black goat of Sen, the oldest, most horrible and powerful dark goddess."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
