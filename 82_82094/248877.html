			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two walked side by side in the fog, and there was a passing of ghost light from time to time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The kingdom of my Lord, it seems to be different from what you imagined!" Su Ge said first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The very cautious Vanas said respectfully: "The divine power of the Lord is not something that my ignorant person can speculate and evaluate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s the queen of Guinness, your awe and humility will satisfy my Lord." Su Ge said with satisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas looked up slightly and looked at Su Ge’s white face, and his heart was revered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that the age of the apostle seems to be smaller than me, and it is worthy of being the apostle of the Lord. It is really young and promising."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few words of chat, Su Ge directly cut into the topic: "The anxiety and despair in your prayers have been felt by my master. As a true deity, my Lord will not abandon any of his children." So my Lord summoned me to help you solve your troubles."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, Vaneston was grateful and said, "I am grateful to the Lord of Mercy. Asylum to the people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded and asked directly: "Well, talk about your situation!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas's attitude gradually became formal, and began to explain to Sug in detail the general process of the whole thing and the present situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cause of the incident is not a rebellious civil strife but because of her brother, Jean Guinness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The territory of the Principality of Guinness is not large, only one-fifth of the size of the northeastern province of Berant, with a population of only 500,000. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the unique geographical location of the country, good water transport, and abundant aquatic products, it is rich in rice and fish, so the national life has been quite good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after all, it belongs to a small country, the overall national strength is very limited, and there is not much good education in the public. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So for many years, the royal family's princess and prince have chosen to go to some big empire, or a good school in a public area to study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old king has a pair of children, that is, Vanas and Jean. Vanas is two years older and older, sister, 27 years old, brother twenty-five. year old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The university at Vanas is the federal university of the Tony Federation on the east side of the Empire, and his younger brother is farther and more promising. The University of Nonia in the mainland, which is the only university in the world with a lord-level principal, has a very strong faculty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When two graduated from college, Vanas did not return to China, but stayed at the college to continue his studies of literature and painting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his younger brother, Jean, took the lead in returning to China and preparing to inherit the throne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The problem is here." At this point, Vanas's face was very ugly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug did not speak, listened calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jean brought a few classmates back together and seemed to be his followers. But since then, Jean has become very It’s weird. When we grew up together, I know his temper very well. His temper is very good and his courage is small and very kind. When he was young, he couldn’t bear to kill the chicken. He liked to contain small animals. But after he came back, his temper It became very violent, very irritating, and even yelled at my father, without any patience."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not only that, he also developed The habit of eating raw. I once saw him cruelly screwing off a cock's head, licking his neck and starting to suck blood, and scared me at the time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Hearing this Sug smacked his chin and said, "He should have some mysterious variation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas sighed and continued Go on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I secretly told this to my father, the father with the guard in the past just happened to see the chicken he was eating raw, then the father wanted He took him to a mysterious appraisal, but he did not agree with his life and death, and even directly attacked and injured the guard and escaped."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You should know that parents are caring for children, especially the royal family. This thing has not sounded, but soon subsided. However, we did not think that this thing has caused the whole kingdom into a deep nightmare." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After a few days, Jean returned, admitted his mistake, and became as enthusiastic and kind as before, seeing him return to normal, we were very Peace of mind, there is not much to continue to live after."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"However, in about two months, a large number of disappearances occurred in the territory of the kingdom, and only at the beginning Several people in the city gradually spread to the whole country and even disappeared dozens of people every day. This suddenly caused panic in the whole country. The father sent the most outstanding detectives and soldiers to investigate, but the final investigation showed that all doubts point to The few followers that my brother brought back, they secretly took people away, tied them up and turned them into monsters through eccentric witchcraft."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "what Monster? "Suge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas is writing a book: "The body is strong, the whole body is hairy, like the werewolf in the rumor."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly, indicating that she would continue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"However, it was found to be late, and when the father was preparing to arrest, that night, Jean brought those people and hundreds. The werewolf rushed into the palace in the dark and killed the father."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When this is said, Vanas clenches his fists and his posture is full of pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is this a bit like the story of Lordaeron’s first filial son?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I don't know the specific situation because I was back to school. The soldiers who survived said that they seemed to be very purposeful. After killing my father, they left directly, except for killing some blocked guards. There is no stay outside."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After that, the whole country was completely chaotic. The werewolves were in chaos in the country, and the army that had lost the king’s command was tangled up, when I was in a hurry. When I came back, it was already a mess. Under the leadership of some nobles who were ambivalent and dissatisfied with my father’s policy, they used my brother as an excuse to form a revolutionary army of the emperor."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
