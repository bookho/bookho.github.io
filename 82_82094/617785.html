			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shelly looked at the shock of two people, the dark frown was slightly wrinkled, and the tone was filled with dissatisfaction: "Look at you again." The eyes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, the two men rushed back to God and stopped looking at them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two men are real big men, supporting the half-day of the entire empire security. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at this moment, the two people in front of this inhuman woman are completely unable to present the posture of the general and the superior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the inspiration of two people tells themselves that they are nothing in front of this perfect existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no perfect human being in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you really see the so-called perfect human, it is definitely not a human! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the warning that two people are still in the student era, the teacher of two people, the mystery of a dominator level to two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a brief shock, the two men gradually calmed down, and then suddenly thought of the sentence that Su Ge just said: "My fiancee is not ordinary ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The short silence lasted for a while, and Su Ge broke the deadlock and said: "According to our intelligence, the recent female warlocks of the Imperial Capital are not very stable. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recommended the female warlock, Coase sneered: "This group of ignorant women are still doing their own dream of resurrection, actually preparing for the female color. Seduce the Minister of Finance of the Empire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green said: "Bennis’s performance is very good, she did not directly cause conflict with the female warlock group. The three The female warlock temporarily received my asylum, which is her reward for protecting Tracy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded, leaning on the sofa and asking: "Today's two Admiral empire will appear here at the same time, greet my wanted criminals in this church, not only to see one side, familiar with familiarity ? "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;After listening to Green's leg, Green was still sitting straight, and asked in a positive manner: "We have an intelligence that you will be interested in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "With your friendship, this should not be free." Su Ge's tone is easy to tease. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green laughed and did not deny it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coase picked up a cup of black tea and concentrated on watching Su Ge: "For the situation of the witch, although we don't know all, we are still very Clearly, those poor girls are not the incarnation of the devil, so we are not hostile to them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge brows one pick: "Oh? Can you get from Kos? I was very happy to hear this in the mouth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coase continued: "With your organization’s intelligence network, you should know some "The attitude of the church?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, there seems to be some dissatisfaction in the rumor that the church interferes with the royal family." Su Ge said with coffee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two looked at Su Ge’s gesture and felt a little unhappy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the attitude of Su Ge, the two people clearly felt that this wanted criminal did not seem to respect the Majesty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Coase’s attitude is seriously corrected: “Your Majesty is not dissatisfied with the church’s interference with the royal family. What really dissatisfied is that the church is fooling the people of the Empire.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wu’s where he would believe this excuse for pulling the banner, his face was filled with ignorance, and then asked: “The two big men are sitting here. The reason also represents the Emperor's Majesty?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course not, at your current level is not qualified to contact your Majesty." Kos is not polite to negate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s eyes narrowed, and the voice had a strange smell that couldn’t be said: “Then I’m a little puzzled, since it’s not Meaning, why are the two big men appearing here, and why do you tell me these things?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, the two people were very uncomfortable and their faces were not good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original plan of the two people is very clear. The attitude of the empire is to show the attitude. After releasing the pressure, he sings a red face and turns to Sug. it is good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plan for the two was completely destroyed by Sherry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of this horrifying horror, they are completely unable to show their attitude and aura as a superior, which leads to two people regardless of the momentum Both up and down are not uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High is not high, low is not, the card is very embarrassing in the middle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the two were silent, Suge stood up and said with ease: "Looking out, the two generals are not ready to explain themselves today. That's what it means. If that's the case, it doesn't make much sense to continue talking."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two looked at each other and then took a look at Shelly and fell silent . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This inhuman beautiful monster is like a mountain in their hearts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg picked up the gift box and said, "I am coming to the emperor for the first time, ready to play with my fiancee for half a month. Admiral's means, I will be very relaxed when I want to find it, so I won't bother today."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, Sug turned with Xue Lier rude go away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Su Ge’s current position, he is not afraid of the power of these two, probably because of the influence of Shirley, his form and mood are gradually The rise of the high has entered a higher level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green sighed and followed and stood up and said, "Morgs, send Mr. Assassin to leave."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of this magnificent manor, Sug couldn’t help but smile: "See them both by you." I was scared, I almost couldn’t help but laugh."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
