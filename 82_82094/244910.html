			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard Su Ge, the knight in the sky suddenly became excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul that is squatting on the ground is a slap in the face, not knowing what his god is going to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s rise from the air, reaching out to hold the tens of thousands of people’s faith and watching his old warship: “This warship seems to be some The condensate of something can be restored to its original state after injecting a certain amount of faith."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the original look? Temple of God?” Su Ge thought about closing his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using his own power, Su Ge clearly sensed the connection between himself and the warship through the blizzard that surrounds the warship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a big wave of the hand, like the power of faith like countless sands spilled over to the battleship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咔咔咔...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Infiltrated from the ice of the deck with the power of faith The entire battleship made a harsh sound that was about to disintegrate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The souls on the deck are very upset at this time, shivering and fearing to fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't be nervous, believe in the power of the Lord!" Suddenly in the golden soul, a voice sounded and passed around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sound suddenly attracted the attention of the knights in the sky, and many knights looked at each other, indicating that this soul is very promising. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Su Ge heard the sound a little unexpected, turned his head and saw it, just to see a middle-aged old soul screaming on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it a fate?" Su Ge was very surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because this soul is not someone else, it is the initiator of the destruction of Bain City, Ron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The soul of death will lose a lot of things in life, because the problems caused by the vision will also be corrected by death, after all, the most powerful purification in the world The effect is death, and almost all negative effects can be dispelled by death. I don't know what kind of state Ron is in now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't take care of him first, handle the battleship well, too crowded."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then increase the injection and integration of faith. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the whole faith is like a catalyst. After injecting into the battleship, you can see that the ice on the battleship gradually penetrates into the deck, and the gray-black deck is like an expansion. The sponge expands as quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, for a while, the volume of the entire battleship increased by a factor of ten! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this?" Even if Su Ge saw this scene, he was surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as many souls felt happy as the place grew bigger, they suddenly found that the deck underneath was rapidly decaying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;turned from wood to dark earth at a speed visible to the naked eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;噗嗤...砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, all the places in the entire battleship were decaying, like a huge balloon bursting open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bombing is very deadly, and the soul of the ship, the outer knight and the ghost wolf are all swept in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge looks as usual, but there is a trace of eccentricity in his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How could this be?" Su Ge muttered in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗷呜呜呜...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the battleship exploded, the Wolf King suddenly burst out Howling, the body turned into countless cold winds and surrounded by the blizzards around, completely wrapped the entire explosion of warships. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A huge sphere that was so large that it was suffocating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge calmly floated outside, as if everything was under his control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up and Sugg’s gaze fell directly above the sphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a place where the temple floats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temple seems to be with the clock, not something that is connected with the ship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After losing the battleship, they floated calmly, seemingly waiting for something, or an instruction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white spheres here have been brewing for a while, the entire round sphere begins to flatten rapidly and seems to be a big pie Like. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blizzard wrapped around is gradually dissipating. It seems that those black things absorb the essence of the blizzard, and today the blizzard has lost the wind and snow, just turned into a gray mist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the fog, the previous warships are no longer replaced by a dark land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, it is a land of dark and irregular shape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This land is very large, and the available area is several hundred times that of the previous battleship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time the ghost wolf, the warrior, and the soul are standing on the black land, curiously watching the fog around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle, the temple in the sky slowly descends, just in the middle of the slightly raised place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge followed the fall from the sky, standing on the cold, dark soil and looking around in the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no obstacles to Su Ge, just like his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hulala...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, there was a sudden violent squirm on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a dozen seconds, a large number of tombstones emerged from the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tombstones are not made up of stones, but are made up of icy ice, one by one that is not a tombstone, more like an icicle . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are twisted and twisted on the ground, and they look very random. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing on the tombstone, Su Ge does not know what these things are for in his current vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The tombstones, who is the tombstone?" Su Ge was not the first to see these things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment of the disintegration of the battleship, Su Ge’s demeanor showed strangeness. At that time, he discovered that there were a lot of ice tombstones inside the huge battleship. They are arranged there in the form of a soldier, seemingly being transported, as if they were sent back, or as a kind of placement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug does not understand the meaning of these things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge looked at it and found that the vast black soil was full of these weird ice tombstones: "There are a lot, and there seem to be at least a few thousand." However, the area is indeed large today, and so many tombstones have been inserted, and the spare space is still very abundant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, we can see that tens of thousands of souls are very Loosely neatly squatted there, facing yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side, under the leadership of the Wolf King, the ghost wolf is not hovering outside as before, but in groups, like a group waiting Command the herd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers stood in front of the souls, armed with weapons and squatting on the ground, waiting for their owners’ new orders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge looked around and sighed: "Although the area has been greatly expanded, the atmosphere is always wrong! The haze The sorcerer's ghost wolf, the grave of the earth, this is no different from a graveyard!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speaking of this, Suge turned to think: "But It seems to be right, I am taking the soul and controlling the hunters of the undead. It seems that I am sitting in the golden glory of the Great Temple. This atmosphere is still very much from the present. It is in my own identity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But this grave seems to have just begun, and with the continued injection of faith in the future, it can be upgraded and evolved. What will it become? Will it be changed from a graveyard to a cemetery?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
