			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How did you see that Emilia had a problem?" Gerlos and Emilia Ditch passed and knew some of Suger's thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge explained: "She is so anxious to call me back, presumably there is an urgent matter. However, when I arrived, she was not in a hurry, that is hesitating. In the next few days, she was sometimes embarrassed and sometimes anxious, and naturally she could feel that this was not normal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Archbishop has so many things, it is normal to appear." Los said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug continued: "Nell has a problem. The church is not stupid. It is from the Stars of Heaven. How can there be such mental retardation? He did this. The only result is to force Emilia to choose a force field, or to make a decision. This decision, no accident is the attitude towards the witch."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Starting Su Ge did not find a problem with Nell, but from the battle of yesterday, he was indeed too arrogant, and no brain, giving a deliberate unnaturalness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night, after thinking about the body and mind, I immediately figured out the causal relationship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nell has already stood up, he is here to force Emilia to play the team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emilia knew that the future was uncertain, so he hurriedly called Suge back to determine Su Ge’s determination and status. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through yesterday, Su Ge knew that the church had begun to doubt itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Nell’s direct shot is to test his own depth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, temptations have produced results. According to Su Ge’s calculations, Nell has reported to the Holy See to deal with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jeros listened to this and said calmly: "Your wisdom and association ability is beyond my imagination."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s heart sighed: “That’s the head of God!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss continued: “I’m getting the same news. Because of this witch's problem, the previous witch conservatives have been completely suppressed, and the twelve bishops have been imprisoned for two times. This is also the case when Emilia is called back. The Encheng incident did not stop at the beginning, and the Nell, this time came to investigate you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then they dare to send you over? Give me a confession?" Su Ge asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss leaned back in his chair and said, "They thought I didn't know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ; &nbsp; Pause, Gerlos added: "I really don't know, this is the information that Adeline got. Also, the church seems to know what the news is, and the ruling has already set off for the night and went to Guinness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge listened to his heart: "The trouble you said is here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley He gave him a lot of information and made trouble for himself. This is the trouble she made. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this trouble has already been calculated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trouble that has been calculated is not too much trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have decided to lay down Emilia, so there is no jealousy for me. Sure enough, the Holy Blood Church knows everything, not stupid." Not nervous, smiled easily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you ready?" What Jackos seemed to think of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My people have been back last night."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss is silent, he suddenly I feel that I can't see this young man who used to be timid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In your current situation, the church will crush you completely, you escape, how can the Guinness royal family go?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is still calm: "I don't think I have enough time, they don't dare to move me now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know the position of the Holy Grail of the Soul." Su Ge said a shocking news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss is still calm, his fingers tapping on the table, representing his lack of calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge stood up with ease: "The forces of the whole world will soon be chaotic, and this is my chance. No sound is already, blockbuster. The bells from the foggy valley should be for everyone. I heard it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Become an enemy of everyone?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The Savior may not be able to do it!” Su Ge’s hands were behind him, his mouth smirked and he looked like a big boy who dreamed of his dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss does not intend to continue thinking: "Some complicated, I still kill my strange, political thing, not suitable for me."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is too lazy to think about these things, so for so many years, still an archbishop without real power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss went back to prepare for the hunt tonight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is naturally not idle, the banquet starts at about 7:00, and now there are three hours at four o'clock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Below to write a letter, Su Ge blows the ink that is not dry, and is very satisfied with the content written. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retract the letter and put it in your pocket, find an opportunity to send it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the time, Su Ge simply prepared to confirm that there was nothing wrong with the equipment, and Jerez would change the clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This banquet should have a lot of mystery, you don't appear very well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Gerlos nodded slightly and pointed to the robes of his own hunter. He said, "I will look outside and stand by."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugian In the heart, in his cognition, Gerlos will never go wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he was about to leave, Su Ge suddenly remembered something, so he turned and rushed into the bedroom, then took out a silver revolver and a bullet. It was the previous Moon Fran and the steel bullets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is..." Gerlos hesitated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge said: "This is a special metal and special weapon invented by Ivan..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp After a brief introduction, Gerlos said: "Isn't this a silver bullet?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Silver Medal?" Su Ge listened . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerlos nodded: "Well, this bullet was originally invented by the Nighthawk Church to refine the mystery of the secret silver and certain creatures. Dedicated to the demon hunter, used to hunt the Yi people, has been the top bullet for many years. In recent years, it has spread in the mysterious world for some reasons, but the number is very small, almost every bullet has a The life of the mystery is counted as the killer of many mysterious duels."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stop, Gerlos asked: "Is this invented by Ivan?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly and sighed: "I thought this thing was the only one. I didn't expect the mysterious world to have been used for many years!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss looked at Su Ge and said: "This epoch-making thing can not be invented by a person, I guess Ivan should be in certain materials at the time. On the basis of misunderstanding."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge listened to nod and expressed his approval. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But this is indeed a rare object. With this, I can handle all mysterious people below the lord." Gerlos said with Moon Fran, indifferent. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This gun is so important, don't you?" Gerlos thought about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge puts a hand in his hand: "I have enough killers now, not bad. I have a bad time for this, and the shooting is very good." The bad guy, using this thing is completely wasteful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss is not polite, straightforwardly said: "Well, you still have self-knowledge." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, the gun is very generous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bain City, you are very familiar, then you act on your own, I don't want too many people to know that you are coming back, I will go to the feast first." Su Ge sorted out his suit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerousin sighed and quickly disappeared into Su Ge’s field of vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Su Ge packed up, walk out of the Cathedral of the Holy Blood and go to Evan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the cathedral, Nell looked through the window and looked away from Su Ge. The corner of his mouth showed a smug smile: "The people, when you found out, have already Everything is over. At that time, I will make you unable to survive, and you can't die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He reported the things he had discovered through the telegram last night. Yes, this morning, the person in the ruling office has already set off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bishop, your acting is seamless. The untouchables and archbishops are estimated to have been cheated by you." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ner's demeanor, and the idiot of the low-emotional quotient before is simply a difference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sister is too unsettled, she will foolishly believe in the witches, and so much to shelter a pagan, I am very disappointed with her." Nell Sit down and say faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside the sacred official said: "This time the Archbishop is going back to be directly confined? If the matter of Suger Sotos is verified, she will even be driven in. Dungeon, then, you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nell puts his hand: "I haven’t arrived yet, let me go, I won’t. That will only Let me be the second school sister and become the target of the old guys. As for the dear school sister, huh, the old guys are reluctant to push her into the dungeon. After all, she is born with extraordinary blood. Being a prisoner is too wasteful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speaking of this, Nel’s eyes flashed with blood and his face was gloomy and evil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 6 pm, a lively banquet is kicking off in a manor in the wealthy area southwest of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After showing his identity, Evan easily entered the gate with Su Ge, and looked at it. He discovered the so-called classmates. He didn’t even see a familiar face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
