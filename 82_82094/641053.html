			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After standing at the door of the gate and ringing the doorbell, a soft, slightly cautious female voice came from the small speaker on the side of the gate: "Who?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello, Dr. Myra, I am Mary, I introduced two friends today to see a doctor," said Mary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no hesitation after listening to the sound, saying: "Come in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, Mary took the lead and opened the door and walked in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge accidentally asked: "She doesn't ask who you brought?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary explained: "She will not be treated, it is judged by herself, so she will not refuse the patient to enter the clinic. Even those who are rejected will be diagnosed by Dr. Myra when they leave. But it is only a diagnosis and will not be treated."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger is more interested in listening to the story, followed Mary into the clinic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing you can see after opening the door is a relatively spacious living room with chairs on both sides, which seems to be the waiting place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time there are six people on the left and right sides waiting in silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people look different, with well-dressed elites and relatively ordinary workers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front is a relatively short corridor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the corridor is a more spacious hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a neat chair in the hall with a fixed iron bracket next to the chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can now see that there are more than a dozen people sitting there hanging bottles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole hospital did not receive, did not collect money, and even did not see the medical staff, people are very surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four people sat down and waited after coming in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge also released the aftermath of the night clock to detect the surroundings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the accident occurred, and the unfavorable night clock was not effective at this time. The bells that were released were sinking into the sea and could not see any feedback. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sure enough," Su Ge sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waiting room was very quiet and people were polite and didn't bother others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Myra is very quick to see a doctor, calming down a patient for five minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge sitting here saw four well-dressed men and women with a gloomy face going out, and it seemed that they were rejected by Dr. Myra. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two of the men and women who look like workers are treated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman took a pack of medicine and left with a happy face, as if she had the most happy thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man is sitting in the chair inside, and with him is a female doctor wearing a white coat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doctor is tall and tall and looks like a meter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A silver-white hair very similar to Emilia is a ponytail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the white coat, it is a clean black neutral suit with flat-bottomed shoes on the feet, giving a very sophisticated, capable and serious feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White skin, with a white mask, her brown eyebrows and a pair of extremely rare blood red eyes look so eye-catching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After giving the man a bit of a bit, she came here and said, "Next."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Immediately, Mary took Angie up and respectfully said, "Doctor Myra."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Myra nodded slightly: "Come on."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug stood up and looked at the direction in which the three men left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, you can see that there is an upward staircase in the left side of the room. It seems that everyone is on the second floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug turned to ask: "How?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl rarely stays silent ,no answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes Su Ge even more unexpected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under Su Ge’s unexpected gaze, Shelly said: “She is extremely unstable, like a bomb that can explode at any time.”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So serious?" Su Ge is even more surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Milla was really very quick. About ten minutes later, Mary helped Angie to come out and Anji’s hand was holding a pack of medicine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that Anji was approved by Dr. Myra. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary apologized: "Because Angie’s status is not very good, we will leave first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded and said: "Well, if you encounter any difficulties, you can come to me. Everyone is a friend who has trouble together. It is a matter of course to help each other."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of the farewell, Mary added: "Oh! Dr. Myra said it was your turn, following the stairs to the left Going up, you can see Dr. Myra."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley heard of getting up and it seems that she is very interested in this doctor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the infusion area inside, two people walked down the stairs to the second floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The end of the stairs is a door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point the door was already open, and a faint smell of medicine came from inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the door is a place similar to the office, surrounded by a lot of books and human body plans and models, behind the desk is with a mask Dr. Myra. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please sit down." Dr. Myra came out from under the mask with a gentle voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people sat down, Dr. Myra looked at the look of the two people, calmly said: "Please come back, the two have no disease. "The body is very healthy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge brows his head and doesn't think about getting up: "The doctor hasn't diagnosed yet, why is it so asserted?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melah's blood red eyes are like jewels, staring at Su Ge's eyes without fear: "See it."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh!? Then you can see what else?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mella continues to respond: "There is still a lingering fate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ha I haven’t had a good luck recently.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug paused and said: “But I see doctors have some lingering bad luck, even There are also two shackles that cannot be solved."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Myra suddenly slammed her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door to the stairs was suddenly closed, and Myra stared at Su Ge and asked, "Are you coming to trouble?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the conversation, an invisible force began to emanate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a time, Su Ge felt a sense of restlessness, he clearly felt his own psionic power, his own soul was born because of something special Resonance, or attraction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These psionics and souls are rapidly separating from his body and gathering toward Myra. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge’s heart was shocked. For several years, he had never encountered a mysterious person who could take psionic power from his own body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that Myra’s extraordinary Su Ge immediately showed his intentions, and he did not want to fight with such a character. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am not malicious, we are here to help you." Su Ge said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The word "Help me!?" made Myra very surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The special momentum gradually subsided, and she whispered, "Where did you know about me?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A friend."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Emilia."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard the name, Su Ge could see that Myra’s eyes were awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few seconds later she returned to God and asked: "She... How is it now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Very good, eat every day, basking in the sun, reading flowers and plants, in addition to not being free, it can be said to be a fairy-like life." Su Ge responded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mella listened with a slight relief and looked carefully at Su Ge and Shili, and asked, "You are not a March church, why? Can I get the trust of Emilia?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can tell my message to others, that means Emilia is extremely trustworthy in front of this man. Female. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge responded: "I used to belong to the March Church. The same beliefs made me and Emilia come together, and because of the disappointment of the church. Let us both trust each other."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This answer gives Mela a lot of peace of mind: "What is your name?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge responded: "My name has been blocked by the church. You can call me Mr. Black Mist now. This is my fiancee, Ms. Black Sheep."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listening to Myra, I didn't ask much: "I have been very good now, and I don't need your help. Thank you for your kindness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No need? So what do you wear so tightly?” Sug pointed to her mask and clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other side of Shirley said faintly: "What you said is a bit sloppy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Su Geton coughed with a sigh: "Sorry, I used the wrong word."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Sugg’s look, Myra smiled. : "I really don't need the help of two people, please come back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of such rhetoric, not waiting for Su Ge to speak, Shelly suddenly asked : "Don't help? Why don't you dare to go out of the house? Why do you secretly connect the four houses into one, forming a complete isolation of the psionics? Why choose these powerful mysterious physiques, or mysterious experiences? The person who became your patient stayed here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the face of a series of questions that Shirley was so sharp and sharp, Myra fell silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley continued to say: "Since you don't say it, I will help you. You are a psychic, born with a top mysterious resonance. The strongest psychic media, you can even resonate and communicate with all mysterious events, fluctuations.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Su Ge’s heart was amazed, he did not I thought that this female doctor is actually a psychic.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the next second he will be relieved.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The momentum that Mela exudes, the attraction and control of his psionic power, fully proves the compatibility and control of the top Xeon medium.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Mela stared at Shelly, as if it was a big enemy.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This mysterious woman actually looked at everything as soon as she looked at it. Thorough, this gives her a huge sense of crisis.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s round field said: “We are not malicious to you, I am with Ai After Leah communication, you listen to her for some reason, it has been bad luck, but also suffered from the shackles of the church in March. She hopes that we can help you. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Myra took a deep breath and said: "The patient behind is still waiting. If the two don't need to see a doctor, please leave."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge did not go on, he got up and sorted out his clothes and said, "If you need any help, Mary can contact me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, turn and leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a residue of a certain evil spirit in Angie’s body, and the residue is acting on her body. In addition, she has recently slept with two nobles. The two nobles may also become a hotbed of residue." Myra suddenly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge said plainly: "I will solve it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the clinic, Su Ge asked: "How is she?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Very smart, It is also very unstable." Shelly made an evaluation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How did you see that she was a psychic?" Su Ge asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t expect that Shirley would analyze it so accurately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl said freely: "You have not been exposed to similar physiques, so you don't understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Please enlighten me, Master!" Su Ge said sincerely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley’s mouth tilted slightly, explaining: “The more powerful the psychic is more unstable, because they will be attracted to all mysterious phenomena, and they may be All mysterious phenomena are assimilated, and to the extent that she is, the kind of existence is like the mysterious sun."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stop, Sherry asked: "Do you know the nature and role of the psychic media?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, let the mystery of nothingness come out through itself as a medium."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shiril nodded: "Yes, the medium is also a channel of mystery and reality. If the ordinary psychic is a hole as big as a pinhole, then her scale is a huge The hollow is still the kind that shines."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This kind of physique has an irresistible attraction for all mysterious phenomena. Souls, evil spirits, demon spirits, and Yi people. There is no mysterious existence that can resist her temptation. The psionic power you just got out of control is the best proof." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Su Ge was shocked: "Is it so great?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, her size is too big. That little white dragon is right. If she is really caught in some special circumstances, she can easily bring a evil spirit to the material world with her psychic scale. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She wrapped herself so tightly because she didn't let her sorrow leak. She converted the house into a psionic fascination. She does not let her breath leak. Her purpose in selecting patients is to find people with mysterious physique and mysterious experiences. These people theoretically have the physique of becoming a psychic medium. The fundamental purpose of her treatment of these people is to make them Breath conceal your breath."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear this, Ge sighed: "It's really not easy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" She was just cautious and didn't take off her mask. Otherwise, that moment your psionic power It is possible to be sucked in half," Sherry said freely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So exaggerated!?" Su Ge was a little shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl said faintly: "If she is completely exposed and releases all of it, then she is a mysterious black hole, sucking in all mystery." After the interior is completely filled, it is possible to give birth to a god."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Su Ge was shocked, but also touched his chin and fell into thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This kind of thing that is the most critical baby, is the Church of the Holy Blood just outside? Is it not afraid to lose it?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shelly sneered: "The existence of this level, if not in the maze of blood, the Church of the Holy Blood can not control her, this is why she is simultaneously affected by the blood of the Holy Blood and The reason for the double bondage of the Star Heaven, this time, is the next policy of the Holy Blood Church forced to choose."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the conversation, Su Ge sees a few A clergyman came over and the goal seemed to be two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
