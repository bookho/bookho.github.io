			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Basilica of the Holy Blood, walk into the interior of the Cathedral of the Holy Blood along the door of the right ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A quiet, wide stone road, beautiful stone arches, roadside lights and benches, all seem to be walking with Sugg once with Father Hank There is no difference at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The copying power of this Holy Blood Church is too strong. This is far beyond the level of technology that should be in this era." Su Ge is full of heart. sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to prevent getting lost, Su Ge caught a passing sinner and showed his identity. The other party was flattered and looked happy. Su Ge went to Ivan's mysterious workshop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bishop, I can only send you here. Ivan has a dog wearing a black dress every day, the dog is very powerful and human. Always protect the nearby places from strangers.” The sinner said with a smile, and he could see that he had learned the power of Luobo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When talking, the door of the chapel was pushed open, and then a large dog standing up to a height of one meter seven stood at the door, revealing a black and white Long face, and a pair of blue eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When his eyes saw the gods here, the eyes burst into a glimmer of light, and after opening the door, the open mouth was screaming The wind rushed toward this side quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bishop, you are careful. This dog is very powerful, if you can, try not to hurt it, it is a good dog." Said nervously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled and nodded, and looked at Luobo who rushed over. If he didn’t see this guy for half a year, he seemed to grow up and his body became stronger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Su Ge also saw that Lobo actually wore a black dress covering the upper side of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bishop! Be careful!" The sinner was physically tightened and prepared to block the baptism for the bishop. At this time, he saw the bishop take the initiative to go up, squatting and spreading his arms, and hugged the big dog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sinner is very surprised, I don't know what the principle is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug holds Lobo’s strong body, his body touches the hair on his body, smiles and says to the sinner: “This dog is not Iraq. Everything is mine, and his knowledge helps me to support him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this punisher suddenly relieved, and his heart said: "Yes, the legendary The pets that are being educated must not be the best."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, in the intimacy of Su Ge and Luobo, the sinners left silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lobo is very excited here, the two claws are on the shoulders of Su Ge, and the cocked tail is constantly shaking like a propeller that rotates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The narrow head continually groaned on the chest of Su Ge, sticking out his tongue everywhere, and his mouth groaned with screaming relatives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug simply sat on the ground and hugged it to let him lick and lick on his body, while carefully touching Lobo’s black dress, gradually It was a touch of strangeness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because this dress gives him an inexplicable familiar feeling, it seems... it seems to be a special fluctuation when playing against the witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Ivan, wearing a white coat at the entrance of the chapel, came out and was very happy to see him after seeing Su Ge: "Sug, you finally Come back!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug holds Luobo and smiles and says, "Well, I am back, I haven't seen you for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Long time no see." Ivan was very happy at this time, the white face was red, and the eyes flashed with excitement and said: "I have studied a lot of good things over the past six months. Would you like to see it later? Oh, yes! I have improved the Assassin Master's jersey, and now it can be more and more mass-produced."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Suge knows this fragile and sensitive young man, laughing and saying: "Yes? Show me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come on! Come on!" Ivan said excitedly, and turned back to the small lecture hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled and let go of Lobo Road: "Go, let's calm down this lonely boy."<br /><br />&nbsp; One hour and a half afterwards, Su Ge listened quietly to Ivan’s inexhaustible explanations, including improved assassin masters’ robes, guns of various calibers, and quick drawing methods. The multi-function compasses of the array, as well as the mysterious version of the night vision device that allows people to see things at night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most interesting one is a quirky black top hat. According to Ivan, this hat is made of special materials. The main function is to eliminate the head psionic power. Conduction, the effect is somewhat like the helmet of the magnetic king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this root is absolutely absolute, and there is no way to defend itself from the outside world, and all the large spells that need to resonate with space cannot be released. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the introduction, Ivan took a sip of water and rubbed his lips and asked, "How! How!!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Great! Beyond my imagination!" Su Ge gave a thumbs up with a thumbs up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was an indescribable and happy and fulfilling sense on Ivan’s face, as if these inventions had been recognized and praised all over the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the approval, Su Ge did not give Ivan the opportunity to continue to speak, pointing to Luobo who was pointing at his side and asked: "It's this dress is What happened?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivan returned to God and said, “Oh! It was when I took it in the morning half a year ago...” (see Chapter 179 for details) )<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listening to Ivan, Su Ge reached out and touched this smooth dress: "That is to say, this dress was the ruins of the Cathedral of the Holy Blood at the time." Excavated in the middle?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am not sure, but I did get it there." Ivan said, good question: "This Is there anything wrong with the thing? What I have tested is an ordinary cloth, there is no mysterious fluctuation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge reached out and touched the seemingly ordinary black cloth and suddenly asked: "Ivan, have you heard of the Holy Grail documents?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivan listened A glimpse: "I have certainly heard of it. But the Grail documents are unpredictable and rarely appear in front of humans."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly, Looking down at the black cloth on Luobo, he asked: "You said, is this black cloth a holy grail document?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well!?" Hear this Ivan’s glimpse, the spirit of some reaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger’s hand continued to feel on the black cloth, as Ivan said, I really didn’t feel any change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is this possible! Every holy grail file has a very strange speciality. I have washed this rag many times and I don't feel any at all." Particularity and mystery." Ivan denied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge patted the body of Erha, let it stand up, reached out and pulled the rag down, licking the hair of Erha and said: "This way How comfortable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The undressed second ha seems to be a lot more comfortable, free to arch the body, constantly shaking his head and shaking his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking out, it doesn't like to wear this dress, just want to give this rag safely to Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When looking at Su Ge’s appearance, Ivan’s face was wearing a suspicion, and he carefully looked around and he still couldn’t see anything unique. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have any evidence?" Ivan asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge squeezed the black cloth in his hand and said: "I heard about the Green Flame Brotherhood incident about a year ago. In the case of the Grail document, Bishop Ron used the Holy Grail document to lure them to come here for sacrifice. According to the situation at the time, the Holy Grail document would only appear in the presence of powerful forces that could resonate with the self. When interrupted, the clues to the Grail document were interrupted."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ivan nodded, he had heard of the Green Flame Brotherhood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After that, it was the matter of Bishop Ron. Since he took the Holy Grail document as an attraction, then this news is definitely not a hole in the wind. There must be evidence or clues. Later, the success of summoning, the horrible existence that undermines the rules of the world must be strong enough. It can resonate with the Grail document. After the event, people did not see the Holy Grail document. But since there was resonance and attraction, the Holy Grail document was in the ruins, but people did not find it."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, Ivan’s eyes gradually widened and then suddenly said: “I remembered, the first time I saw Lobo, this dress was already worn in it. On the body, Luobo is very spiritual, but when he can wear his own clothes. After every time I wash the rag, Luobo can always wear it the next day. Because of Luobo’s expression at the time. Too deceptive, I have neglected this important thing. Now, at first glance, this rag is clearly attached to Lobo!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug Smile and nod "And I feel some familiarity on this rag."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the breath?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "On the street, a witch has run away. I feel the same breath between the two, a similar atmosphere that is unclear and unclear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh!" Ivan nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then what he seemed to think of, hurriedly said with a shock: "Wait, you just seem to understate a terrible thing!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled and briefly said what happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to Ivan more shocked, wide-eyed eyes from top to bottom, carefully scrutinize Su Ge and sighed: "You have experienced this for more than half a year." What? The change is really great."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God knows what I have experienced." Su Ge thought about the time when he was sitting in a wheelchair. Road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivan naturally knows that there are many stories in it, but he didn’t ask much. He looked down at the rag in Su Ge’s hand: “Now it’s still in the theoretical guess stage. How do you judge the authenticity of this holy grail document?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
