			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge looks as usual, deep eyes are filled with calmness and calmness, lifted his feet, and took a steady step forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this step, a black ripple quickly spreads out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Mill and others felt that the color of the whole world has recovered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hold your ears, take them and turn away from the palace, without my order not allowed to come in." Su Ge looked forward and calmly told. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three listened in a hurry and nodded, took out something and blocked the ear firmly, turned around and held two people, Randall held it all at once Four people left quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a time, the vast palace was left with only two living people, Su Ge and Vanas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghosts around them shivered on the ground at this time, they did not expect a baby to have such a terrible power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why! This is totally different from what the Lord of the Moon said at the beginning! How can we have the qualifications for this kind of existence!" Dr. Salo's mental breakdown Low-lying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of the Mountain is completely scared at this time, and there is no movement there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Lord of the Moon! What should we do!" For a moment, the Duke of the Mountain turned his head and asked the Moon Beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are not very clear about the concept of the Great God, they just know that anything that is intimate with God will be very horrible, instinct they are still very fearful and taboo of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the summoning success, this outsider (the moon beast) is not aware of what the great god is. For it, the so-called great god is just a bigger insect. There is no threat to himself, not to mention his son. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the indoctrination of the subjective will of the Lord of the Moon, the three people who were vague in concept were suddenly fooled by the moon beast and thought that the Son of the Great God was not too big. The threatening, stumbled to this step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, at this moment, when they really heard this horrible cry, they were completely stupid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of this situation, they still want to eat the flesh and blood of the baby? It’s just an idiotic dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This month the beast is still not dead at this time. It seems that due to the identity of the "outsiders", he has certain resistance to the crying of the Son of the Great God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s all cold, stiff lying on the ground, making a hoarse and weak voice: “The Son of Death is in front of you, you can act.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, the two people are completely stupid and start acting? How do they act in the face of this horrible existence! ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The bug is a bug after all." The mood of the moon is still indifferent, high above. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Su Ge raised his foot and stepped on the chest of his fat body. He said with disappointment: "The moon beast, pay attention to your tone." Now, you are a worm."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moon is hoarse and cold: "Inferior humans, enjoy this time, in the future, my master will The world is once again included in chaos and establishes our own order."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your master? Is %#%¥#?" Su Ge calmly asks questions . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghosts around him felt a weird blur at this time, and did not hear the name that Suge said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You damn human, who told you the name of my great master!?" Hearing the words of Su Ge, the moon beast was extremely angry, violent Daxie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge sneer: "Ignorance is your fatal wound, ugly, really can't see the truth of the matter, it is you."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, Su Ge lifted the Great God Declaration and directly stabbed him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You tell me! Tell me!" The moon is struggling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Su Ge did not answer, and his attitude was indifferent and pierced his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord of the Moon, completely dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the death of his faith, the Duke of the Mountain and Dr. Salo are sluggish and look at the Lord of the Moon, which looks like a stupid, Half a day is not a god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, there was a sharp wave of volatility in the pool ahead, and then the second cry came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this crying, the whole world is once again in black and white, and the walls of the surrounding buildings are gradually decaying and disintegrating because of the power of terror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, a large number of souls around them are like annihilation, turning into fly ash, and being sucked into Vanas in the mourning of fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why is this?" With the annihilation of the soul, the Duke of the Mountain looked up in confusion and looked at Su Ge with a hint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge's demeanor: "The next generation believes in a good god, don't just grab a low-level monster and tribute to the gods."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of the Mountain was very excited after listening to the expression. Finally, his mouth opened and he laughed. "It’s a big joke."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Finished, completely dissipated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The side of Salo seems to have resisted the crying of this baby because of the special nature of knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, his face was bitter, his eyes were confused, with deep self-doubt, he was in a hurry to ask Su Ge: "Who are you?" Why is it so calm in the face of the Son of God?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because I have a good faith. Those outside gods and old dominators will only bring endless destruction. Su Ge calmly answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the dying person, Su Ge’s instinct as a late-night prisoner carries a mercy of mercy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salo covered his face with his hands on the ground: "Where are the gods in the world still good or bad? All the gods represent absolute fear and destruction. This is the eternal curse of this world. We humans are just inferior The monkey, always on the ground."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, his body is like a broken ceramic, a lot of cracks appear, and then suddenly broken, disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug has some regrets, not because of the death of two people, but because of the annihilation of a group of souls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death is absolutely equal, and Su Ge, the person who treats death, will receive and guide him equally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These souls at the moment are not dissipated, but annihilated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that is, their souls have become an indescribable other substance that has disappeared into the world and will never appear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg turned his head at this time, his dark eyes looking to the pool in front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pool is dry, Vanas in a long skirt is lying there, the belly is big and scary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clothes have been swelled, the waist, the underwear, the outerwear are broken and scattered, the swollen abdomen and the towering chest with the bra are exposed in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s eyes stared at the high-expansion abdomen and step forward again: “The Son of God, you chose the wrong mother.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The baby seems to feel the meaning of Su Ge, the white skin of the high-blowing abdomen with a horrible momentum quickly appeared a lot of black blood vessels and lines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the skin, a baby's head and face gradually appear, and it can be completely born through a thin film. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The baby’s mouth slowly opened, and again a very loud cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a time, everything around Vanas began to break down quickly, decaying, and dying, including the ground, including the earth, and even the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reality of that kind of substantive death concept is condensed in every part of the air, and human beings will have no reason to die directly if they are slightly touched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Su Ge felt that his body was under great resistance, as if blowing a 12-level wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, this kind of wind is full of deadly poisonous gas and blade, and it will be killed if it is slightly contaminated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of this situation, Su Ge’s face gradually became serious and he did not dare to care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A louder, more solemn voice of the late bells came out, and while a huge black halo gradually spread, Su Ge’s body also A large number of pale blue spirits surround his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After several breaths, dark black exquisite robes, huge hoods, burning smoldering eyes, and four black and wide wings one by one in the psionic power It appears on the body of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front, the invisible force instantly corrodes the sound of the late bell of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the invisible force quickly eroded, the four huge wings behind Su Ge suddenly opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calling...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the strong wind, the black feathers fluttering in the air The invisible power of the Son of the Great God is instantly offset by the cleanliness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In my current level, the body of God cannot be condensed in the human world. It is just that the posture of this night bell can be revealed through the power of death. This is by psionic power. The formed body is the reality of my soul form, it is like a bone armor implanted in my body, so that I can use the death authority more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Unfortunately, after losing authority, I am incapable of showing the soul form of the self to form an entity. After all, this symbolizes the form of the late bell, which has gone beyond the human form, and is another high-level existence." I feel a little sorry in the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
