			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this scene, the remaining four grooms are wide-eyed, and the attitude of the shotgun is full of fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Idiot! A group of idiots!" hiding behind the vehicle, the captain of the escort whispered angrily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a total of more than 20 people here, and now suddenly died more than half, and the bandits outside are suddenly beginning to let go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bandit leader took the man from the moment and walked to the body of the first two businessmen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hahaha! You are really stupid! Do you really think that Laozi will let you go? Also offer some assets!?qnm! Laozi directly kills You can get all of your assets!" Forcedly kicked a foot on the businessman's body, bending over and unplugging the two men's bags covered with blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roughly untied the backpack, and took out about two hundred francs of cash, three-point contract and a set of cloth wrapped up, attended the meeting wearing a suit . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two poor businessmen seem to be preparing for important meetings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"cnm! Grinding, let Laozi wait for such a long time!" Several other violent young people kicked in the other bodies, in the mouth The swearing words are constantly changing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the team, everyone was frightened by this fierce bandit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this scene, Su Ge spit out a cold chill, sweeping around the line of sight and discovering that the bandits scattered around are now moving closer together and appearing in two rows. Guns, it seems that they seem to have little interest in the goods and intend to attack them along with the goods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What to do!?" The remaining four drivers were shivering and shivering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the four guards not far away, after seeing the change of the bandit's formation, the eyes slightly back, silently calculated that they are away from the river the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five seconds later, four people threw away their weapons at the same time, and turned to the river by relying on the cover of the team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that I am ready to jump to the river to survive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! boom! boom! boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The precise four shots, four people just ran out less than 20 meters and fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hahaha! Run! Run! Look at whether you are running fast or our guns are fast!" The robber leader grinned and was very excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guards are dead, and now these robbers are not in a hurry to shoot, as if they were catching the mouse of the mouse, playing with these things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The rest of the people are getting out of Laozi! I am crying here and begging me. If I am in a good mood, I can put you in a way, hahaha. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Listening to the harsh sneer, the four simple drivers are caught in a terrible struggle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey! Are you going to look at it like this?" The head of Elena sounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time Elena looked as if she was on the side, dark red hair hanging from the edge, and the beautiful face of wheat with a leisurely look at Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge calmly said: "Of course not intending to look at it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned In front of a driver, softly said: "Quiet waiting here, you will be safe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s voice carries a special magic And kindly, the four drivers were slowly returning to normal after listening to the panic, and the trembling heart gradually subsided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;趴 Irina at the top saw this scene with amazement: "This seems to be a quiet rumor that the priest can use, what is this guy's identity! ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, Su Ge calmly walked out of the bunker, just to see that more than thirty robbers have been dismounted, with a playful and smirk look Here, the hands are constantly playing with firearms, like a group of butchers watching the lambs to be slaughtered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at these people, Su Ge squeezed his cane and took a deep breath and said: "You, this team is very important to me now. Can we move on in a more peaceful way?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader of this side looked at Su Ge carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This young man is well-dressed, with a sense of calmness and calmness that is incomprehensible, and the process of walking is steady and elegant. A contemptuous gas field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be careful, this guy is not a broiler." The leader has a rich experience, whispering a warning to the next step and asking: "My name is Tes, this The leader of the team. I don't know how you call it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You can call me...the bell man.” Su Ge thought of a more appropriate one. Code. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Watch the clock?" The chief of the head of Tess frowned, quickly thinking about the corresponding knowledge from his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, he did not find any information related to the clock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;趴Elena on the goods muttered: "It’s quite good to pretend to be a ghost, but also a bell, the name is quite good, very artistic and style, but this title can be It doesn't match your assassin's occupation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger continues to say: "If we are, I will go back now and take people away. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a ghost!" The young man on the side snorted and picked up his pistol and raised his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, two sounds sounded almost simultaneously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"!!!" At this moment, all the robbers here saw this moment of horror, and the pupil was staring at Su Ge’s face suspended in the air. The bullets, the heart is constantly accelerating and beating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be seen that the bullet that was shot at this time seems to be blocked by something, blocking the air in front of Su Ge half a meter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Elena saw this suddenly remembered: "He used this strange ability to block the call of that person last night."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening his own vision, Elena saw a faint aftermath around Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This aftermath is very special, constantly spreading, constantly shrinking, and reciprocating to form a perfect cycle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My God! What is this? Psionic shield? No! Psionic shield can't do this. So perfect psionic distribution. This sturdy architecture and psionic sequence, damn! What shield is there, it's a huge all-around shield! And it's the strongest tower shield!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This guy is definitely not an ordinary assassin." The first impression was very important. At this time, regardless of the ability of Su Ge, he was involved in the relationship between Elena and the Assassin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a cold expression of Su Ge, his posture lifted his hand and gently pinched the bullet that was about to fall. The voice said indifferently: "Can I understand it?" At this time, do you give up the signal of peaceful resolution?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait! Wait! Mr. Zhong Ren! No! Please don't get me wrong!" I hurriedly raised my hand and explained it in a hurry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this scene, these robbers finally know what they are facing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a true mystery! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it’s not the kind of weak chicken mystery that the Duke invites to be no different from ordinary people. This is a real powerhouse, truly mastering mystery and killing people invisible. The horror exists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge stepped forward and his mouth sounded like a cold, cold voice: "It’s late."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the robber’s ear rang a heavy, solemn, sacred, solemn bell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bell is like the redemption sound from heaven. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bell is like the sound of judgment from hell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
