			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the mountain road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shelly looked down at the densely packed people on the ground and said calmly: "There is a road inside you don't go, go here, you are looking for death." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge's pace is progressing steadily, and he said casually: "They don't plan to kill me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"They are going to kill me." Shirley stressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug turned to look at her and said: "Do not worry, don't say anything else. I will not let you die because of Ada's relationship alone. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ada is important to you?" Shelly suddenly asked, with a hint of incomprehensible in her tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger is thinking about his own fortune at this time, nodding his head and thinking: "Of course."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait for a chance, I will kill her." Xue Lier said viciously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg listened to his brow and wrinkled: "What are you crazy about? She is your sister, your sister!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shelly screamed twice and did not answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Su Ge saw her, she knew that what she had just said should not be true, so she opened the topic and said, "Where are you leaving, what are your plans?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nature is with you." Xue Lier said of course. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing with me??"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl pulled off his hat and glanced "What else can I do? I want to make myself look like this, naturally I want to find a relatively safe place to restore strength."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge listened to his heart Thinking about it, it is very simple to say: "Good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, I thought you would deny it." Xue Lier said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a big sword fell from the sky, but it was cut on the night bell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole person’s body has not yet landed, and he is flew out of the bell on the guard and falls to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge calmly replied: "I am not the kind of person who likes to shirk responsibility. Although your purpose is not simple, I did benefit." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shelly looked at Su Ge’s back and was not talking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the watchful eyes of many people, there is no stop for the pace of Su Ge and Shirley, and it is steadily advanced towards the top of the mountain. There are dozens of clergymen attacking before and after. The two, whether physical or magical, were completely shot and fell to the ground when they were not close. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the first stun of Su Ge’s horror of knowledge, over time, people have discovered that Su Ge’s psionic power seems to be endless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the way through the battle, the means are constantly changing, but there is no sign of the slightest depletion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes more people feel shocked and scared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, not everyone feels shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elf Church is very calm here, watching Su Ge and even his face with admiration and gratification. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because they know very well why Su Ge has such a huge amount of psionic power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your eyes are really accurate," Bells said seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside him is a handsome knight wearing a purple armor and holding a long sword, the bishop of the official Elf Order, Lance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second batch of support of the Elf Order is that he has taken the initiative to ask for it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lance’s face was happy: “He didn’t let the elf adults disappoint.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;After that, he squeezed his hilt and said: "It is a pity that I can't help but see my friends being treated unfairly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bells patted him on the shoulder: "Sug does not need our help, we have already communicated with each other."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although it is just a look But I feel his infinite self-confidence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The camp is not in the fortress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They are deliberately pushing Su Ge to the road." Moore said seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Below you can clearly see that the church was not in a hurry to attack in March, they locked the ring in an unhurried manner, pushing Su Ge to the top. The road to the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the Holy Father, Ryan, the three archbishops have started at the same time and headed to the top of the mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The net started to gather. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serina on the side was a little anxious: "Is it so watched that Su Ge was caught?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "The death of the woman in the black robe is helpful to the whole world. I don't understand why he wants to protect her." The old man standing next to Moore said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This old man is the captain of the fortress and is a lord-level astrologer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Moore went north, it was her order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moore respectfully replied: "He is not the kind of person who does not know the depths. I estimate that there is another hidden feeling. After all, the words of the church in March are not credible. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man nodded slightly and agreed: "It’s hard to see how he got through this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"You...saw?" Moore was surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can't get through, and how to get through is completely two concepts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man smiled and revealed that there were not many teeth left: "His life star has been bright, although there is a lot of dust on it, but it has not hurt its roots. That is to say, he is prepared for this disaster."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing this, Serena suddenly sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the mountain, Su Ge has now reached the highest peak of the entire mountain Over the top of the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a relatively flat place, except for the two raised dragon horns, which are very flat overall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people just came up and saw the three masters of the dark star, the butcher, the grave guard, and led the 20 clerics to be lined up. Wait a minute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg seems to have known for a long time, with Shen Lier calmly coming over and sighing: "It seems that you really do not intend to let me go today." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark star pinches the dagger, and the expression is full of anger: "Sug Sotos! You join the cult, shelter the evil spirits, today you will die "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looked at the dark star and said: "The brainwashed brain is shut up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You!" Dark Star is even more angry, but does not dare to attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horror of Su Ge, he has seen it before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butcher squeezed the sawtooth chopper and looked at Su Ge, and the numb face was hard to say seriously: "You still have a chance."<br />< />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge still has a lot of good feelings for the butcher. He shook his head slightly and sighed: "The road is different, it doesn't matter. You should know this ancient slang. You know very well, three The church will not bring real salvation to the world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butcher remembered Sapir, remembering the monsters that the clerics he had killed, He is silent and does not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I heard that you have knowledge of death." At this time, a small grazing stalker made a hoarse voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge arbitrarily said: "Slightly know one or two."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My favorite knowledge of death." The grave guard raised his head slightly, and the worn hat fell down. A pair of dark, can not see the eyes of the pupil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Be careful, the grave guard has the ability to devour knowledge." Sherry reminded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bundle!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the conversation, the priest in the back suddenly screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, countless psionic wires suddenly appeared, directly entangled in Su Ge and Sherry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the dark star body instantly turned into a black shadow sprint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, the blade full of black light directly stabs to Sherry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is extremely disgusted with Su Ge, but he also knows exactly what his true purpose is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Roll!" Su Ge screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thick bell rushed out instantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, the dark star suddenly felt his body hit a ball full of elasticity, and then the body suddenly flew out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This side, the vibration of the late bell has completely lifted the bondage between the two bodies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the two men had just recovered, Shelly shouted: "Be careful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Su Ge immediately alerted that there seemed to be something behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the stick suddenly slammed, forming an iron umbrella behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The impact of the metal came, and Su Ge’s hand suddenly appeared a strange cold flame, suddenly slamming backwards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attack fell through. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My God! That cane can actually become an umbrella!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Not a cane, look at the strange blue flame! How do I feel so cold!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The students saw this suddenly awkwardly quarreled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teachers are dignified at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because they found Su Ge’s means, it seemed to go far beyond their imagination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the blue flame just flashed past, their inspiration told them that this flame is extremely dangerous and will die when it comes to it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the foot of the mountain, Laurie’s face was dignified and asked: “This flame is similar to the hoarfrost of war, but it is still more difficult than hoarfrost.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point everyone sees the extraordinary of this flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is the ice flame of the cold king." Ryan said incomparably dignified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;! ! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, not only the three archbishops, the Holy Fathers are all stunned, full of horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cold King! That is a god! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they were shocked...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! Boom! Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sacred, solemn, distant bell came from the top. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not good!" Everyone's face changed dramatically and quickly rushed to the top of the mountain<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looked at the front, like a black mud, appeared next to the dark star, and then became the body of the grave guard. He already knows who just attacked himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugton's face is extremely dignified: "Come here!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl also knows that it is now In what case, I quickly ran to Su Ge's arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger left Shirley in his arms, holding the Great God’s declaration in his right hand, watching the surroundings with vigilance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You want to be faster, more terrifying is still behind." Shirley whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge took a deep breath and looked at the crowd and said, "Now, accept the trial of the late bell!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, a burst of sacred night bells came out, four dark wings appeared behind Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a burst of blue mist surrounded by the flames of Su Ge's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Block him!" Seeing this, the dark star was pale and his eyes widened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grave guard saw it, his face flashed a ecstasy expression, and suddenly opened his mouth and rushed to Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that you want to eat Su Ge in general. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the next second, her body suddenly froze, as if she saw an indescribable horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark stars and many mysteries from the top are directly smashed out by the indestructible sacred bells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the silent, the dark wings fall like a heavy snow on the top of the mountain, with a sacred and solemn solemnity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the feather rain, the death of the four wings has come to the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
