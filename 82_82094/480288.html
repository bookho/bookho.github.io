			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day is very calm, and Su Ge has nothing to do every day, that is, to study the basic spells carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In so many basic spells, Su Ge learned three basic spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One is the most practical restraint, an intensive technique, and one is the most useless noise that Suge originally considered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And meditation and hypnotism, he himself has learned, these three spells are enough for him to learn for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the church’s affairs were handed over to Vanas, Suge was very relaxed every day, except for learning meditation, he only needed time and Jelos and Lan Del docked the situation in the northern mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The days passed quickly seven days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dream, Vanas looked at Su Ge coldly and said in a blunt tone: "Jane has just reported to me that the healing church has determined the location of the source. It is in the ruins of the ancient city of the misty mountains. And a special expeditionary army has been organized, led by a bishop, and opened to the misty mountains this evening. Jenny is also among them."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can see that Vanas still remembers Su Ge’s last stunned vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge pretends to forget, and directly replies: "The church's command is also coming down. It is the closest to the Misty Mountains, and they will soon send an expedition." The army, then ran here to take me north and give them as cannon fodder."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Emilia was removed from the position of Archbishop yesterday, going For the time being, you don't want to be careless." Although the tone is cold, the semantics can still see the concern for Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugen said: "I will give it to you after I leave."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "My rule will definitely be better than you!" Vanas said, raising his chin slightly, like a proud black peacock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Vanas seems to be a child who is eager to express himself. If he is idle, he will say that he is better than Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge did not care, but the high-cold look matched this context, making him feel a little cute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He’s mouth reveals a strange smile: “Qing is blue and better than blue. As my successor, if it’s not better than me, it’s too disappointing me. I pulled you out of death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, Vaneston felt that his proud high chest seemed to be stared by some kind of sight. Suddenly, his face was very cold, and he reached out to Su Ge with his fist out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiles and prepares to escape, just in time with a chilly wind, Jerous appears next to the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Gerlos blinked and looked at Vanas, who was annoyed, and the cute fist that was raised and raised toward Su Ge. Suddenly, I was a little embarrassed: "Is it not time to come?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas is more awkward than Jellos, stiffly put down his hands and put away Steps, controlling his emotions, asked: "What is the situation, Master Geros?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is now only arrogant, not unrequited. She still has enough respect for the true masters of Gerlos, Mill, and Father Water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerousus frowned: "The fog began to spread, I have a feeling."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you feel?" Su Ge, who was preparing to run away, asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss touched the chin full of white scorpions: "They seem to be ready for something, waiting for some people to come."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he finished, he looked up and asked Vanas: "His Majesty, is there any action in the three churches?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vanas nodded: "The news of the church has just been cured. The expeditionary army has already opened this evening, aiming at the misty mountains."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a problem." At this moment, I suddenly thought of the information left by the mysterious woman Shirley and the words I once said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have any clues?" Vanas asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge nodded. "I have had contact with the mastermind of this incident. She has provided me with some important information. The price is to create some trouble for me, just like this time. At the time, she said such a sentence in the letter. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The so-called big event is for people to see, if you don't see it, there is no point in such a big event."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear this, Vanas frowns slightly, lifts his white fingers and gently points his white and high nose, and falls into deep contemplation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss first said: "There is a conspiracy. This reminds me of the day before yesterday, Randall’s enchantment did find some special traces." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What trace?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"coagulated black blood with ominous familiarity Breath." Gerlos's face showed an extremely rare dignity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wanas tempted the question: "City of the disaster!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Have you know? "Jerouss was surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas said casually: "Since becoming a Pope, I naturally need to know everything. I have passed the Royal Library and the Holy Blood Library in recent days. Complemented some books about the secrets of the mysterious world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge has some movements in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can feel that the "some" that Vanas said so casually is definitely not something in the conventional sense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mysterious world knows that there are very few people in the city of disasters. Even Su Ge knows only one name, and the other content is unknown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she has always been a layman who has not been involved in the mysterious world. Actually, through the description of a drop of blood, it is a city of disaster, which is how big. Kung Fu, Su Ge can't think of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss continued: "This is a very likely shadow of a city of trouble, we must be careful."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas thought about it: "Re-distribute some people in the past. I want to transfer the Walter apostle away from Bain City to the Misty Mountains."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No! The Walter Apostle is our biggest and most important card. He is the key to our future entry into the northeastern province." Su Ge immediately denied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas’s eyes are gradually dignified, and the gas field is fully open and staring at Su Ge: “The future is so dangerous that it will definitely be attacked by the Church of the Holy Blood. The shadow of the city of disaster, this is beyond our previous estimates. Compared with your safety, the northeast province is nothing!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This I can't help you, knowing that there is a conspiracy, I can't let you take risks!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge looks at Vanas's strong look, and his heart is warm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One side of Gerlos said: "The Pope said that there is no reason. Anything involving a city of disaster should be marked as the highest dangerous level."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a lap of analysis in Su Ge’s mind, I saw Vanas seriously: “I just thought about it again, I will not be dangerous. Because we have other Helper."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who?" Vanas asked some unbelief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no fortress. I know two law enforcers in Bain City. They are very concerned about this matter. If they want to go, they must pass Guinness. At that time they will definitely take the initiative to find us." Su Ge said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerousus nodded slightly: "Indeed, for many years, the fortress has been tracking the city of disasters, and the two sides can be said to be the opposite of many years, if they also go, and In the words of our allies, there is really no need to call Father Water."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas did not speak, did not agree, and did not object. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Randall is calling me, it seems to be a problem. Let's go to the front, if you decide, you decide." Gerlos said, The body disappeared with the white frost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When looking at the silent Vanas, Sug smiled and said, "Thank you for your concern."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, Vaneston browed and looked strong. "Well, who cares about you? I just care about the church. If you have problems with this clock, the loss to the church is too great."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I paused, she frowned and added a displeased look: "How do you see that I am caring about you? Where is my tone about the heart!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay! Ok! I am passionate about myself." Sug smiled and waved again and again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas immediately quietly turned around and turned his back to Su Ge and asked, "Do you have a fortress, are you sure?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg thought: "I am sure, and I have other helpers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who?" Vanas Slightly face, with a hint of curiosity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She doesn’t understand, he has so many helpers where the mortal body is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge raised his hand and a horn-like horn appeared in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas came over and picked up the horn to look at it. When I saw the texture above, there was a shock in the indifferent face of the year: "Call the dragon flute ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this thing called Dragon Flute? I don't know." Su Ge spread his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gwens did not say what it was when he gave him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas looked at Su Ge, his eyes were a bit complicated, he bit the pink lips and threw the horn to him: "I don't care." "You handle it yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled: "Do not worry, I have not lived enough yet."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas snorted and did not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is the fusion of the knowledge of the god of death?" Su Ge switched topics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas said faintly: "Yes, I talked to Grandpa Mild yesterday and said that I am about to enter the lord class."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
