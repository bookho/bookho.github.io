			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Happy for a while, Lance mysteriously asked: "When you walked on the lake, did you feel some special feelings and knowledge?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge deeply nodded with a touch: "Yes, when I walked to the fourth step, I felt the vibration of my spirit and psionics. I seem to have mastered some Spirit and spirit can interact with each other and mimicry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is that?" Lance's specialization is not in this respect, and some do not understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In a nutshell, there is a gift of spiritual illusion," Su Ge concluded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lance nodded. "It turns out that you have found this knowledge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Have you got some special knowledge at the beginning?" Su Ge asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lance smiled and nodded: "I can see the essence of human nature and get it there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The place is really a fairyland on earth." Su Ge sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lance agrees: "I really want to go again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people sighed for a while, put away the spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you mean when you are about to enter a dream?" Lance asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is not concealing, explaining: "My master has the ability to master dreams. As long as I can enter the dream, I can use the power of the Daoist. I have the ability to suppress the Son of the Great God."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you sleep..." Lance was a little embarrassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled and shook his head: "Ordinary dreams and reality can't be connected. I want to go to a special dream that can be directly related to reality. Dream space."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Isn't this similar to the special space in the wonderland of the lake?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge mysteriously smiled: “That’s not a space, but a world. Let’s go. Time is tight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the crowd saw Su Ge, they felt that Su Ge in front of them suddenly changed into a person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It feels more calm and mature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mill carefully looked around: "Where has changed, I can’t see it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone feels that Su Ge has changed, but he can't say where it has changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Randall and Hills don’t care about Su Ge’s changes, because in their opinion, Su Ge makes any changes, even when it suddenly becomes The sages, the half gods, they will not be surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because their Pope is a god who is a human being, is an apostle of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger put on his black hat and picked up his cane: "Everything is ready, go to the Dukes of the Mountains now, let's go!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, Randall and Hills first got up and walked out behind Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following is Prince George, Mill, Elena, restores the adult-shaped Maria. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then is the Vigny, Lance and Connor who just finished eating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hearted person walked out of the mighty, the aristocrats behind stood there with big eyes and eyes, and lost their minds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Swear to protect the Queen!" Several core supporters of Vanas screamed, and the body instantly turned into a werewolf form to keep up with the pace of Prince Jean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mysterious people are gone, we may not be safe here, and we may be able to get the shelter of these mysterious people." Other nobles thought about it and finally A bite, followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The visitor went to see a group of nobles who all followed, and smiled and said: "Mr. There is really a way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled:" In fact, these people are not useful, just to support the background of the scene."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be careful!" At this time, Vignia gave a low voice and punched. In a ghost that flies over and looks sly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the fist passed from the ghost's body, and the ghost bypassed him and grabbed Jean directly to Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mir immediately took out a bottle of pharmacy and said: "Be careful, this is a soul sorcerer, immune physical attack, our body has no way to touch. Special Feeding on the human soul."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the soul, a kind of monster in the system of vision, needs 23 points to see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, of all the people who can see it, Jean’s strength is the weakest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the soul sorcerer is very fast, and now comes to Jean, the white face is greedy: "Delicious soul!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mir Grande!" Jean was calm at the moment and said loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This side pulled out the long sword and took out the pill bottle on it. It seemed to touch something like silver blood medicine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s too late!" Elena yelled and reached out to release her burning power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But her ability has no effect on this ghost without entity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oops!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a hand with black gloves quickly Outstretched, like a poisonous snake that launched an attack, the palm of the hand pinched the ghost's neck accurately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What!?" Seeing the Soul Eater was suddenly caught by Su Ge, and the people around him and the demon spirit were surprised at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Human, how can you meet me!?" Contaminated with a strong sense of death, this demon has evolved part of the mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge raised his head slightly and asked: "A soul is only a hard body. Is it difficult to meet you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I killed you!" When I heard this, the Soul Eater felt that my dignity had received a provocation, and stretched out two slender claws, and caught a gust of wind against Su Ge's head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that a powerful heartbeat sound came, and Sug held the palm of his neck and shook it slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, slamming, the body of this demon seems to have been attacked by countless times, and the body has shattered into hundreds of pieces. Then it turned into the original psionic power and completely dissipated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge casually smashed his hand and said easily: "I thought it was a powerful character, but it was just like that."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, the way of calmly proceeded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind Mil, Elena, Lance and others, they all happened so fast that they didn’t find out how the ghost died. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this Su Ge I know?" Elena couldn't believe it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mill turned to look at Lance: "What did you do to him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lan Sri Lanka returned with a slight smile: "This is a secret, it is not convenient to disclose."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next journey is opened by Su Ge, and everyone can say that it is all the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In less than twenty minutes, a group of people drove to the house of the Duke of the Mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The house of the Dukes of the entire mountain is now empty, no one, no one knows that these people are turned into werewolves gathered near the palace, or were sent by the Duke of the Mountain in advance. gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The group quickly walked in through the open door, and immediately saw a lot of broken windows, shattered doors, and a lot of scratches on the walls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this, everyone knows the end of the man in the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This guy is crazy!" Many aristocrats saw this scene, and his face was unbelievable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tiger poison does not eat, they did not expect the Duke of the Mountain has been cold-blooded to this point, even his family and the followers have not let go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger’s attention did not stop on it, releasing the aftermath of the late bell, then he seemed to perceive what, the body quickly ran to the second after the mansion castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd saw that this did not dare to neglect, and hurriedly stepped forward to keep up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What exactly does Mr. Sotos want to do?" Jean asked Mil, confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mill looked up at the tower and made a cold voice: "He should be looking for the summons they used before the Duke of the Mountains."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is the use of that summoning array?" Elena asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mill’s eyes said profoundly: “Maybe he has the ability to make the array have other effects!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Suge, who was at the forefront, quickly came to the tall castle and felt a little close to it. After the goal was determined, the heart moved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Invisible sharp edge instantly cut the locked door in front of it into six pieces, scattered all over the place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My God! This is a horrible means!" Many nobles saw this heart can not help but beating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghosts just can't see them, but now they can see clearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rear of Randall sees this, the expression is full of gratification and happiness: "The growth of the Pope has gone far beyond my imagination. But this It is also true that today’s Majesty has finally possessed the knowledge and gas field corresponding to the Pope.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Su Ge in front seems to know the structure of the entire castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go to the north side of the first floor lobby, open a dark space, open the door behind the wall, and there is a tunnel leading to the underground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illina looked at Su Ge’s calm back and muttered: "This guy, when did you touch this place so thoroughly?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a glimmer of light in the eyes of the mil, no words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After about five meters down, everyone came to the ground of the castle, a relatively open space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire space is an oval, like a cockroach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The height is about four meters and the diameter is ten meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are four silver pillar supports in the middle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turning on the lights, everyone saw the light on the ground, drawing a huge array of complex and indescribable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This array is so subtle and complex, even extending to the walls and ceilings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four inscriptions on the four weighing columns were engraved and became part of the circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Here should you summon the place of the so-called Lord of the Moon?" Mill came over and looked around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly: "I need to mobilize this squad and let it be connected to the space that summons it again."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you know what they are summoning?" Mill asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, that thing is called the Moon Beast, one of the Yi people. With superb wisdom beyond ordinary people, how much Lingshi can be seen, I am not sure. It has more than human high-tech, and the overall combat effectiveness is not low." Su Ge walked to the middle of the circle and said casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Moon Beast!?" A mysterious group of people heard this vocabulary and fell into meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
