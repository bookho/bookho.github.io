			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Analysis of this, Su Ge generally understands this complex causal cycle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he always feels a little wrong, instinctively feels that he seems to have overlooked something, but just can't remember. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Forget it, this kind of thing is just like inspiration. I don't think about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sug said, his eyes fell on the gloves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The overall structure and function of the glove has not changed, still under his control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that there are more channels and loops inside, which seems to be some kind of energy control device. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After no problem, Sug put on gloves to restore the human form and walk out of the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside, Gerlos is waiting quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge said with ease: "The Lord said that there is no problem, what you have just experienced, and I will talk about it in detail."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss nodded and wanted to say the whole process and the existence, but just opened his mouth and said something else: "Keep this glove safely, if there is any loss I came over and married your country of God, Sotos!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Su Ge blinked and was a little aggressive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Gerlos’s face is a bit ugly, and both eyes are more stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master?" Su Ge asked back to God's temptation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss groaned and asked: "What's wrong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Speaking before Situation." Su Ge asked seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss frowns: "What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge took a deep breath and didn't say anything. He smiled and asked: "Nothing, is there anything going on here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss nodded immediately "The Frost Witch and the Sonic Witch want to see our Kingdom of God to ensure peace of mind."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg thought: "No problem, you go to them Bring it over!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerousin sighed and then tempted and asked: “Is there something just happened?”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerez at this time is like having a time jump or a memory being edited, completely ignoring everything that just happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug shook his head: "Nothing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss did not say much, along with A blaze disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the disappearing Jerous, Su Ge frowned: "This sentence is very informative, first of all, before Geros entered a country of God and somebody There is a contact, and the existence is likely to be the incarnation of the Mori Black Goat, or his son."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From the tone of this speech, It should be that the incarnation is not wrong, and even it has its own will."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He should now mistake me for Yugo Sotos or It is a person associated with Yugo Sotos. His power in the world is likely to be equal to me, far from what the dark sons of the past can match. This is also the direct invasion of the fog of dreams that he will soon enter the Kingdom of God. The reason why Gerlos walked away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But due to the problems of the current world rules, He is likely to be like me, the real power can only be in this The special space appears, there is no difference between the real world and normal people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" He should have been observing me for a long time, and even had a certain intersection with me. Who is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s heart quickly touched the people he had recently touched. I will go through it again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's her!" Su Ge suddenly thought of the gathering of lust and jealousy, Shirley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That weird existence can even cause vibration and feedback from the gods, which is definitely not the height that ordinary people can reach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If mad hunting really has some of the power of Yugo Sotos. According to Yuge Sotos and Shab Nikolaas The special relationship, which explains why Shirley can cause the body to vibrate through the flesh."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge thinks this touches his chin: "I Killing his child, now I don’t attack me, but instead give me some of my strength and strengthen the body of my child into a glove. The logic of this is somewhat unreasonable.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; In contemplation he returned to the temple and once again started the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To reach this height, the so-called descendants of the child are not needed, and they are no different from those of the ants. The dull mortal cannot understand this kind of thing. "The deified Sog language is cold and cold." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shabu, you better not to hinder me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Booming...< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shenwei is like a prison, Su Ge’s heart is slightly cold, and the entire godland sky immediately has a deafening thunder, and the vast country of God has whipped a terrible blizzard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;匍匐The huge ghost wolves in the fog stood up and looked up at the sky, and they clearly felt the boundless will of the Lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knights clench their weapons, solemn, pure gold eyes looking at the sky, solemn and revered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a darkness, Vanas, wearing a royal robe and wearing a crown, came in. When he heard the thunder in the sky and the snow around him, Suddenly, his face was a little shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened? Who caused the Lord's anger!" Vanas hurriedly turned to ask Pamela. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pamela shook his head and said that he didn't know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After another blizzard, Gerlos walked into the Kingdom of God with two witches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment the two witches first came in, they felt an indescribable terrorist will from the thunder in the sky and the blizzard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will is like covering the whole world, everything is under his control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will is like the earth, like the sky, like the ocean, like the sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will is like the beginning of the world, the end of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His vastness cannot be described, and his majesty cannot be speculated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pump! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two were unable to withstand the pressure of this horror, and they were physically weak and stunned on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss felt that this was a little flustered and turned and asked: "The Pope, what is going on?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know, I just did it when I first came." Vanas was anxious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, at this time, the thunder gradually stopped and the blizzard subsided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the absence of time, Su Ge calmly walked out of the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people rushed forward: "Why is my lord so angry?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge calmly said : "Nothing, the Lord just thought of some unpleasantness of the ancient gods, and has nothing to do with you, don't think about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two listened to their hearts and minds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge then passed through two people and looked at the two witches who were lying on the ground in the distance, laughing and saying: "It seems that we don't need to say anything more." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two turned their heads and looked at them. They found that the two men had been kneeling on the ground and prayed piously toward the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas asked: "Is this the two master witches in the intelligence?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Gerlos nodded slightly: "Yes, the two people have hesitated before, and now there is no problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled: "Give it to you." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, he will withdraw from the dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas listened deeply and took a deep breath, looked at the temple with awe and worship, and went to the two witches in the gas field and began to become a teacher. For the first time after the sect, the work of the believer was recruited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, after a meal, a god punisher informs Su Grid to hold a meeting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the camp, the three archbishops are centered around, surrounded by a circle of bishops and other people at the bishop level, a total of nine people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Before you entered the city and the information you got, we have seen the three archbishops. It is very important." Laurie spoke first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Laurie continued: "Although something happened yesterday, there were no casualties that did not affect our exploration today."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next speaker said: "I have already passed through many mysterious people in the early morning. They are very willing to explore the ancient city with us. Now the external contradictions have been temporarily digested. We need Working together has always been to the outside world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of the Holy Word has a special kind of magnetism and magic, which makes the inner heart full of calm and peace, instinct Will not cause any contradiction and rebellious psychology, just thinking to follow his meaning to act. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug's eyelids drooping, the slow fluctuations in the night in the mind, blocking all these strange things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!" The crowd said at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;枭The final assignment: "Now carry out the assignment of tasks, Captain Moore, who does not fall to the fortress, we will give you an elite force of about 50 people to help you Specially dealing with the hunter of the disaster, is this a problem?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moore immediately nodded seriously: "No problem!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, our back and flanks will be handed over to you."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;枭 After talking about turning to the Elf Order, Bells: "The Elf Order has a unique advantage in alerting dangers and insights. I hope Bishop Bells can help us to protect the city gates and walls. To ensure that the road we are backing can be kept safe, this task is very important. The main church of Horace leads the elite troops to assist you. Is there a problem?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bells seriously Nod: "No problem, lead!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Dark Star Bishop and Bishop Sapir, both of you are the top two of the bishops in the present, today The exploration will be hosted and promoted by both of you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes!" The two men nodded immediately and looked up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge slightly sideways, unexpectedly found a very precise mechanical prosthetic arm on Sapil's broken arm, and there is no movement in the palm of his hand. the difference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, I fell on Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bishop Sotos!" His voice said calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge looked up and looked straight at the pair of sharp, deep eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;枭 Continue to say: “Now the city is unknown, we need the best spies to help us determine the situation ahead. I have heard about your knowledge and previous experiences. I hope that you can lead us to scout and join the big forces to enter the city first, determine the details of the city, and pass the map of the entire city back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge nodded quickly: "No problem, my knowledge is related to sound waves, although the combat power is not strong, but as a scout to explore intelligence, I still have full confidence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The three bishops were very satisfied with the answer so happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Laurie stood up and said, "So, for the sake of our church alliance dignity, for the goddess of the gods, start acting!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequently, a group of bishops such as Su Ge quickly left and took the orders of their respective archbishops to claim their respective teams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bishop Sotos, wait a moment." He suddenly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge stopped and turned to look at the three bishops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This time your actions are the most dangerous, and as a prestigious legendary bishop, you are a very important person in our March church. To make up for your combat effectiveness The insufficiency, the three of us decided to give you a helper." He said with a smile on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug did not refuse, smiled and said: "Thanks to the love and care of the three Archbishops, if that is the case, then it is the best."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lauri nodded: "It’s good to understand our good intentions, this is your partner in the next few days: butcher."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, and a thin middle-aged man with a jagged chopper, wearing loose black clothes, officially the master of the horrible fighting, butcher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As soon as the butcher approached, Su Ge asked for a strong bloody smell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scent is not a true scent, but a mark of his psionic power, a stench from his soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butcher was very reticent, and after bowing to the three people, he turned to look at Su Ge and did not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge smiled and reached out: "In the next few days, please bring more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The butcher was silent, but he reached out and held it with Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This grip, Su Ge clearly felt his palms are extremely rough and heavy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surface is like a sandstone. When you see it, such a hand will never let go of anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a good guy!" Su Ge said seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butcher listened to his brow and then let go and went out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sages looked at Su Ge with a smile: "I am waiting for your good news."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sug seriously salute: "Must be done."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Su Ge’s simple preparation, he and the butcher took two expert-level hunters. Two expert thieves left the camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pace of the six people went very fast, but just ran halfway up the mountain, Su Ge was tired and panting, holding his hands on his knees and said that he could not run. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His body is no different from ordinary people, but it is stronger than ordinary people, and these special occupations that have been physically and mysterious are not a level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are five people who are not arrogant and do not breathe and stand on the side of Su Ge, very happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge gasped and said: "Let's go to the road, not to run, how to get dry quickly."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Bishop." The two thieves whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug holds the cane to support the body, watching the sleepy butcher's heart with some doubts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to Randall’s intelligence, this butcher’s ability to move is very slow, but now it seems that this guy is coming this way, and the pace is as fast as flying. same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butcher seems to be very reluctant to talk, just waiting quietly there, saying nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Su Ge rested for a while, a group of six people continued to go up the mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After five minutes of leaving, the church’s army was fully opened, and more than 300 clerics were led by the three lords of the lord, the mighty Go to the ancient city of Ya. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When six people arrived at the ancient city of Su Ge, they found that a large number of mysterious people were waiting outside the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gate of the city was empty at this time, but no one entered, and the discipline was unexpectedly neat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Su Ge and the people simply explained, six people, under the watchful eyes of hundreds of people, walked down the gate into a dead, ancient city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five people are all entering the ancient city for the first time, and they look at them with great vigilance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s bells gradually spread around, and then took out the prepared pens and fingers to quickly map the entire outer city, including streets, houses, and even How many layers in a building, Su Ge are accurately drawn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two thieves who followed Su Ge saw this secretly surprised, filled with envy and awe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the legendary bishop, and the knowledge he possesses is so powerful and different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is already familiar with the whole city, with five people in the city, not only the situation around, but also very clever Bypass the monsters that wandered through the city. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After an hour, six people wandered around the city to completely determine the structure of the entire outer city, and everyone unexpectedly found that a battle did not happen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butcher looked at Su Ge at this moment and didn’t know what he was thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a group of people walked back to the city gate very efficiently along the street, it seems that several battles have taken place here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a large number of mad descendants and mutant villagers on the ground. At this time, the clergymen are cleaning up the battlefield, and the church coalition forces seem to have no casualties,<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three lords are sitting in the middle of the army at this time, deploying the entire coalition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge quickly found three people after returning, and sent his own map. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So fast? So accurate?" Seeing this large, detailed hand-drawn map, the three were a little surprised at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have walked once before, and I have some impressions. The knowledge of sound waves is very useful. There are many things that I don't need to run over to know." Su Ge said very modestly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;枭With the map saying: “Rapidly send the map to the two bishops of Sapir and Dark Star, officially enter the city to explore.”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here Laurie looked at the map brows slightly wrinkled and asked: "With this city now The scale of this area is somewhat wrong in the urban area."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded directly and said, "Yes, we are now in a foreign city. There is also an inner city in the center of the outer city. There is a huge wall and gate in the middle. I feel that it is too dangerous, so I dare not go in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three people After listening to the flash of light, the Holy Word said softly: "Your decision is correct. Let us not disturb the things inside. We will handle this here and make sure that we can serve us as a stronghold and we will enter the inner city to explore." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Laurie said: "Sug, you have worked hard. The goddess will not forget your dedication, go to rest first. "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Scotland nodded, quietly pushed aside to rest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next many mysterious and church coalitions quickly spread the map with Su Ge, investigating everything in the outer city, even every house Not let go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three hours later, people found a total of 124 mysterious rooms for sacrifice, seventy-three mysteriously killed The body of the corpse, while the monsters of the entire outer city were all cleaned up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scout in front of the city is determined to have no problems in the outer city. After it has been completely controlled, the army will once again open and leave the city gate to approach the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But just as the entire coalition has just advanced about three hundred meters, the sudden change has occurred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Somewhat wrong!" Laurie, who is very sensitive to the darkness, said first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he suddenly felt the light in the entire space seemed to be darker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afterwards, everyone found that there was a lot of gray fog in the entire city, and the fog surrounded the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Go back! Go back!” The three bishops who felt the wrong were immediately yelled and then took the lead and returned quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But when they turned their heads, they suddenly found that the place they had just passed was completely ruthless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The neat and clean houses and streets have become tattered at this time. There are scratches everywhere, and the houses are mostly broken. There was also a burst of black smoke, which seemed to have burned like a city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the blackened walls, there are dirty things everywhere, dry blood, the head of the monster hanging on it, the intestines and the internal organs that fall on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking up slowly, people found that the clear sky just turned into a grayish red, like the whole sky is burning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air is filled with an indescribable smell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a rotten sour smell, a burning stench, and a pungent bloody smell and stench. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the blink of an eye, everyone feels that they have entered hell from the normal world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vomiting and vomiting......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;facing the scenery at this time, smelling the smell in the air Some priests who experienced less vomiting in the stomach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Archbishop!" Seeing this scene, everyone was a bit flustered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lury said loudly: "Don’t panic, we should be inside the space, don't be afraid!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;枭的眼 blinking with a special gray light, looked around and said: "This is a mirror space, we just stood on the side of the table, now it is the inside, and this is the truest of the whole city. Situation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When talking, such a large group of people seems to have completely alarmed the original works of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗷呜...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a strange scream, a low sigh, people find a lot The terrible monsters slowly gathered toward this side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before you can parasitize the black shadow of the body, in this place can be said to be everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The ancient city! This is a terrible scam!" The three churches saw this scene suddenly pale and gloomy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge was hiding in the crowd at this time and his face was very bad. He did not expect to enter the inner side of the city so easily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not expect that the inside of this city is actually this look, comparable to hell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as everyone was taut and ready to fight, a thick voice came from the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You, welcome to my ancient city!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sound is extremely loud, Falling down from the sky, ringing in everyone's ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are people looking at the sound and seeing a huge figure in the burning sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body looks at least four meters high, looks like a human being, and wears a worn royal robe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has no hands, four tentacles on each side of the shoulder and a huge shredded wing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This four-meter-high giant body shape is symmetrical, without any bloated feelings, and even some martial arts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looks handsome, but his four big heads actually have four faces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One left and right, it looks very strange, and people can't help but tremble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
