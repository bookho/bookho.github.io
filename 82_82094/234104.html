			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Running in the dark, Su Ge’s head tells the operation and rushes to the east gate of the Basilica of the Holy Blood in the shortest distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that everyone’s attention is attracted to Rogan, and there is no one to pursue Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In less than ten minutes, it is blurred to see that the door is already far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing hope, Sugga hard, the speed of the body's forward momentum suddenly increased to the maximum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But suddenly, there were five black people who had never seen Sug before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who is this?" Sug saw this dignified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not sure if these people are clerics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes swept in the night, and then the guard room of the guard gate was darkened, and the air had a faint bloody smell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The guard is estimated to have been killed, damn it! This group of guys seems to be really going to let me die!" In the thought, Su Ge's body slowly Stop and adjust your breathing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person who took the lead at the moment took a step forward: "If you don't want to die, you will go with us, and adults may bypass your life." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the moonlight, when Su Ge saw the face of this person, his attitude was gloomy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five people, he knows four, because these four people studied with him for a month in that ghost place a month ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name of Jem, who claimed to be a bard, was a profession of spiritual attacks through different temperaments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time, this Jim was just an apprentice, but today I felt it carefully, and Su Ge found that this guy was actually an expert bard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at it, these five people are actually expert mysteries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When talking, Su Ge heard a faint voice, and when he was awkward, Su Ge suddenly found himself suddenly surrounded by five people. In the middle, five people held out their hands and firmly grasped their bodies so that they could not move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't struggle, let's go." Jem's face under his hood was awkward, and the pale teeth reflected in the moonlight, giving a strange look. The horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s body struggled desperately but did not help, and then he wanted to launch the power of the late bell, but suddenly found his cock to be locked up by something. Not available. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't you know? Silver-gray steel handcuffs, specifically designed to block psionic flow, are used to imprison mysterious devices," Jem explained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg looked down and found that his hands were firmly locked by a pair of gray gloves and could not move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn! What to do!?" Suddenly, Su Ge was in trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dark, Jem looked at the floor and struggled Su Ge nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Su Ge was completely in the hallucination, but he was completely unaware. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Phantom Lock has come into effect, and it will be sent to the Bishop." Jim said, along with several others, lifted Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about the dog?" asked another young man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Su Ge got into the environment, Erha called two times and found that there was no effect and then ran out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A beast, even if the rescuer can be used? At that time he was already in the hands of the bishop." Jim sneered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others smiled and nodded, the bishop is invincible! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as several people lifted Su Ge, a cold voice suddenly sounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the use of the rescue? What do you say is useful?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be careful!" In this voice, Jim's face changed dramatically and suddenly screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, the three-in-one-meter-long ice gun suddenly appeared in the dark, and shot at five people like a sharp arrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Defense!" The five taller men screamed, their hands slammed open, and a huge moonlight shield appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two collided and actually offset the ice gun completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this makes the tall and young people look pale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get off! It’s a master warlock!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s late." After, it is accompanied by the indifference magic sound that comes out of hell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this moment, Jem feels that time is still, his eyes are stunned in horror, his expression is distorted and frightened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three blood columns spewed in front of him, and the warm blood that was full of astringency fell from the sky, and fell on his head, face, and robes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In silence, three headless bodies fell weakly on the ground, and at that moment they did not seem to know how they died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Take your dirty paws away." The cold, cold voice came again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jem twisted his stiff neck and looked at his voice, his eyes tightened like nails. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not far away, a slim body stood there, her body covered with tight black scales, blue long hair combed into a ponytail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two dark dragons on the top of the head have invisible majesty, and the dark red mullion is inexplicably shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that moment, the claws of the cockroaches were carrying the heads of three people. The technique was very skilled, as if they were carrying three bags of things at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! Behind her is a long tail with a spur black scale, and the huge force directly smashes the bluestone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let your dirty paws go, don't let me say the third time." The dragon girl was a little annoyed, and her tail swayed constantly, like a whip. The sound of the sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jem returned to God, and his strong desire to survive made him instantly pinch Sug’s neck in his hand, and he said with a sigh: "Don't come over! You dare to take a step closer, I will kill him now!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;噗嗤! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the voice just fell, Jim felt a tingling in his chest. When he looked down, he found that the cane that had just landed on the ground actually flew up, like Pierced his heart with the precision of his own life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Steel...Steel..." The mouth spits blood, and when it is not finished, the body falls to the ground and loses its life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last remaining clergyman was completely scared at this time, sitting on the ground and sluggish, forgot to escape and scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the shadow, the sexy and sexy Adeline walked out, and there was a Benedict wearing a light blue tight dress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Pope's Majesty!" Seeing the fallen Su Ge, Bernice ran quickly to determine the injury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside the gate, Marx’s face touched the back of Erha and sighed: “This is a god dog!”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a scream in the distance, and Marx said without saying: "Since this road has been chosen, there is a sense of dying at any time. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What if the Pope is okay?" Hill, in the form of the dragon, asked Su Ge in a princess's position and asked with concern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
