			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the camp, Su Ge put his hands behind him, and Hills, with a pinch on his side, lowered his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the future, go out and talk to your companions, don't rush out of your own business, even if you meet someone, you should come back and talk, lest we worry. Going to a hundred or two meters, the problem of your body is not more than ten seconds."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s face is right, he said slyly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hills nodded constantly, licking his lips and looking very happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few werewolf soldiers on the side saw this smile and shook their heads, patrolling patrols, cage fires. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whoever saw Su Ge’s nervousness when he woke up, naturally knew that Su Ge was not blaming her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hills knows for himself, so he shows such happiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no need to see the movement and rush out. Now it is a very special period. I am not asleep when I sleep. After coming to the Misty Mountains, I must talk to you in advance." Do you know?" Su Ge continued. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm, um, know! Know!" Hills chicken nodded like a glutinous rice, looking serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Raising his hand and touching the little brain of Hills, Sug sighed: "Don’t be too impatient in the future, think more, this aspect You are worse than Bernice and calm down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well!" Hills continued to nod. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound waves sitting on the blanket in the distance looked at the bitter Suge, and the happy face of Hills, the corner of the mouth naturally showed a smile: "It is difficult Imagine that someone cares and cares for the witch."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger calms her body and says: "The bishop can see a lot of us. The truth that can't be seen clearly is the great man with great wisdom."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said, he ripped open the trousers of the sound wave, looking at the swollen and scary inside, skin tissue Blackened calf, brow furrows: "How can it be so serious?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Life and death, with one leg for a life, very affordable." Sound waves said calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger did not speak, like a magic, took out a silver scalpel, cut a hole slightly on the swollen skin, suddenly purple blood flow come out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Release the psionics to check, Alger said faintly: "You are lucky, and a few days later, your leg will be amputated."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Sug took Hills and came over and asked, "How is the situation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The leg bones of the left calf are comminuted fractures. The basic knife wounds and bullet marks on the body are skin injuries, and the problem is not serious. Organs and others are normal," Alger said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded, walked to the carriage and looked at the sound waves sitting on the blanket and asked: "With your mastery ability, deal with the few brilliant churches." The garbage should be very easy, how can it be so embarrassing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a tiring answer in the eyes of the sound wave: "I have always heard some whispers in my ear. Whispering, not only the mental weakness, the psionics began to be unstable, and some signs of recession, this was succeeded by the bastard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The explanation, she looked up Su Ge: "How do you know that I was chased by the Glorious Church?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I naturally have my channel." Su Ge did not answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound wave did not ask much, nodded slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge asks: "What happened just now? How can I completely perceive your position?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound wave is a faint explanation: "You and I are all knowledge of the sound vibration system. I heard it when you release the bell. Your way of detecting the bell is based on the reflection of the sound and the vibration of the material. With subtle feedback, I only need to build a shell that simulates the spread of your sound waves, radiating outwards along your vibrations, keeping the same frequency as your bell, and you naturally don't feel the feedback of the bells."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you still do this?" Su Ge was a little surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound wave gave him a look: "Are you a little too small to see the master's means?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Su Ge immediately remembered Father Water and I said that the master has several means of being an expert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge spread his hand: "I am ignorant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are going to Going to the Misty Mountains?" The sound wave suddenly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You want to go?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well." The sound nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To be with the frost?" asked Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic looked at him: "You know so much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The estimate You will not be able to." Su Ge was on the chair next to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Just got the news that the frost has been caught by the Nighthawk Church "Closed in their camp."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What!?" The sound of the sound suddenly stunned and suddenly stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sit down!" Alger held her hand in one hand and then pressed it in her thigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the sound suddenly felt like a numbness in his lower body, and he couldn’t sit back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger said plainly: "You want to amputate is your business, but since this leg passes my hand, I can't sit back and watch."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I need to cut my legs, take out the broken bones of the bones, and then re-assemble them, you give me honestly!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic looked at Alger's strange gray eyes and felt like a little girl was being scorned by the doctor, which made her very uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge said faintly: "As far as you are, what can be used in the past."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic looked up at Su Ge and whispered: "Then you What do you want to get? Or what do you plan to do?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge stood up and looked at the night sky: “I have a lot of plans, I want to get a lot, I am relieved Well, when you need it, I hope you don't drop the chain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hills then whispered and said, "You can rest assured that adults know If you don't sit back and care, you can feel good about it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, turn and follow Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A burst of blood suddenly splatters, Alger has cut the calf's calf tissue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound is a little bit quiet inside, turning to look at the serious Alger, the more I don’t understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why the bishop of the Holy Blood Church is so dedicated to sheltering the witches who are called by everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not a lively example of Hills and the kind interaction between the two, she really can’t believe it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is your eye?" asked the sound curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger’s hands pick out a small piece of broken bones mechanically and accurately, calmly saying: “Because you look directly at the existence that cannot be seen directly, the spirit is It’s polluted.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound was suddenly shocked and she was very clear about what was not visible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not crazy!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course crazy, then locked up Holy Blood Dungeon.” Alger's tone did not fluctuate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you...now..." She hasn't seen any mysterious person who is out of control and can return to normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger looked down at the wound seriously: "I just said that the bishop has great wisdom."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Late at night, Alger used the spirit to stitch the wound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, you can see the swollen calf, the blood has all been released, and the size is almost normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use a make-up splint to live and wrap it in a bandage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, Alger." The sound wave was a bit white at the lips, and the voice was weak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger turned and handed over a cup of hot milk: "Drink, you need a lot of protein and fat next."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said, he took out a blood red injection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Blood therapy!?" Holding the milk in both hands, the sound was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, only a weakened version of the body part." Say, put it into the needle tube and inject it into the leg of the sound wave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound waves are a little overwhelming. Looking at Alger’s calm face, I am very embarrassed: “This is a little too expensive.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger did not speak, and after all the treatments, she bent over and hugged her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This moment makes the sound of the sound body stiff, and even wants to launch a power attack in an instant, but is suppressed by her reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the age of fifteen to the current witch, she has never been close to any man like she is now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are not afraid that I will become a monster to eat you?" Sonic looked at Alger's calm side and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger’s voice is still very calm: “If you are afraid, you will not be healed.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Said that he turned and put the sound waves into the carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A good rest today, your legs will be fully restored in two or three days." Alger said, handing over the blanket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you..." The sound wave face was a bit hot, and he whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger snorted and closed the door and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound wave slightly got up and looked at Alger's back, I don't know why, the speed of the heart jumps somewhat faster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, the group continued on the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge and Sonic are sitting in a carriage because he has his own small abacus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My recent knowledge is in a bottleneck. Can you help me?" Su Ge asked with a positive look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sound wave, then thought that the two of them are a faction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to know?" She is still very fond of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially last night, Su Ge’s embarrassment to Hills, and finally the pet’s touching gestures, made her feel close to Su Ge’s instinct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That kind of look, that kind of eyes are disguised, she believes in her own insight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge touched his chin and said, "I walked this way and I knew all about the whole sound vibration. Everything went by feeling. There are many basic things." I am not very clear, and it is very difficult for me to want to go further."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For example?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "For example, precise control of sound waves, wavelength fluctuations, frequency changes, and how sound waves are transmitted, etc."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic brow wrinkles: "These you No?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge has no choice but to answer: “I will, but it’s all by feeling. It’s the time when I’m here, I’ll feel it myself. I want to know the detailed principles and details of this, or the knowledge in the past can't be deduced."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soundon looks at the monster's expression He said: "I really can't understand how you came this way. These things don't know how to get to the expert level?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
