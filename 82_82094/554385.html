			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing Carl’s request, Su Ge asked: “Do you know the outside world?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, the ability of both of them is obtained through me, in the abyss." Carl replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge silenced and nodded: "Okay, I promise you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carl seems I trust Su Ge very much, looking down at the book in my hand and sighing: "I have summoned a lot of things. I thought it was my masterpiece. It was a great contribution to the whole human occult. I didn't expect it to come. The descendants have caused so much trouble."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug did not speak because he did not know how to answer now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There has been said that the time has come." Carl smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard this, Su Ge immediately felt that the whole space began to distort again, and an invisible force tore his own spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge squeezed the book in his hand and looked at Carl and said, "Thank you for your support and understanding."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Kar stood up and waved at him: "I should thank you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank me?" Su Ge stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You let me see..." After waiting for Carl to finish, Su Ge’s form has been distorted and disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the disappearance of Su Ge, the entire study began to collapse, Carl opened the study, surrounded by a dark world filled with twisted monsters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, I should continue on the road."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug licked his eyes, returned to God, bowed his head and found himself holding the skull in his arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you okay?" Andrew's voice came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge spit out a breath: "Nothing, just see some of the illusions of the past."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Seeing that Suge spoke clearly and his eyes were clear, the two men breathed a sigh of relief at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s cane became a chain, locked the skull behind him and asked, “How long have I been swearing?”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s been an hour,” Randall said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge spit out a breath: "Go, go find the next thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's next?" Andrew asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Four faces." Su Ge said, taking the lead to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yagu City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is still dark, while the bright moon illuminates the city, but it gives people a feeling of surprise and despair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three rounds of the moon are not visible, and many believers feel lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, losing direction is not important. What matters is that terror is in front of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining twenty clerics are now in a group, led by the Holy Father and Ryan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time they tightened their arms, the whole body was tight, and they were very nervous and looked at the darkness in front of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They don’t know what the monsters are, they can only see a white mask, and a dark cloud of changing shapes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Father who stood at the forefront was very dignified. At this time, he held an open book in one hand, and the first hand was placed on the chest, and the corner of his mouth was whispering. At the same time, a burst of holiness, cleanness, and homogeneity are constantly released to cover all clergy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why, don't you know me?" Under the mask came a sinister, sultry and seductive voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only hearing this voice, the clergy can instantly feel that this is a woman who is extremely vicious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when the men heard the sound, they couldn’t help but sway, and then they burst into flames, their ears were hot, and their breathing increased. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In one sentence, you can seduce the most primitive animal nature! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishops such as Dark Star immediately bowed their heads when they heard this, and recited the scriptures to calm their minds,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The three archbishops were able to resist this temptation, and the sages even shouted directly: "Meditation, nourishment, peace, peace."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord's Word Very strong, the clerics around the four words after the four words were gradually calmed down, and after a breath, they returned to normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lyan pinches his arms and stares at the mask in the middle of the black gas and asks, "Are you the legendary black goat of the forest?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shelly did not answer, the dark eyes looked at the holy godfather and said coldly: "Let's meet again, after a lapse of twenty years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Father has a complicated saying: "I really hope that I will not meet again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That blame your ability is not enough, no Kill me at the time," Xuelier replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Father is silent: "Since you have survived, you should live well, why do you want to do such a thing, and it has become what it is today. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because the old I am dead, now standing here is the new me, a me who wants to completely destroy the entire March church." Snow Lill replied coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The singer said: "It’s a big deal. In March, the church dominates the entire human world. You are a person in your district. What is this saying?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley looked at the sages sideways. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the face of the Holy Word was pale and he did not dare to speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Father said with a compassionate saying: "The entire March church remembers your contribution to the whole human race. You are a hero."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have no interest in heroes. I have been eaten by you since I was cheated. Now now is my new form, the new one makes you feel endlessly horrible. Form." Shirley's voice chilledly answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ryan’s faint question: “What is your form? Now you are nothing but the energy of a fixed form. If you don’t have a fixed body, what is your qualification? Such a big talk."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black fog gradually rises, and Shirley’s voice is high: "I naturally have a real form, but you don't have to watch it." To my true body, but a group of inferior squatting locusts, but also want to peek into the noble body of the Dark Mother? This is the most ignorant joke I have ever heard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "The so-called physical existence is not determined by yourself, but by others. The embodiment of the body manifests its existence to other people and thus causes cause and effect to the whole world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Father opened his mouth calmly and said: "Even if you think you already have a form, but there is no other person's cognition, recognition and memory, you still don't exist."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley’s voice with a hint of sarcasm Say: "I want to use this method to excite me and expose me to the form of my own? It is naive. But today I am in a good mood, so I can tell you a message."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Someone has seen me, recorded my body in the world, he is the proof of my existence in this world. He is also the only person in the world who is qualified to see my body. And you , not qualified."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear this, the Holy Father’s heart suddenly sinks to the bottom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having a body that is recognized by people means that the world recognizes her existence, which means that she is free to move, not affected by the previous constraints. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This can be said to be a big loss for them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everything is my sin." The Holy Father muttered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He always thought that here is the Mori Black Goat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he was wrong. After he saw the dark cloud more than two hours ago, he knew he was wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because this existence is no longer the god full of frenzy and darkness, but a new existence that has undergone many complex fusions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is, neither. Although she lost a lot of power and ability belonging to the black goat of Sen, it also became more difficult and horrible than the black goat of Sen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has jumped out of his embarrassment, like a butterfly that has faded away, into a great gesture that they can't understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Only the body is not enough. You are wearing a mask because you are not ready yet." The Holy Word said calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This battle is no longer a battle of knowledge and psionics, but a battle between the truth and the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking thinking and logic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl wants to kill the will of the Holy Father and let him admit his failure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Holy Father also wants to make Shelley feel frustrated, so that her heart can not be calm, to achieve perfection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley sneered: "You are wrong, not that I am not ready."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp After a pause, Shirley turned to look at the leading mountain: "but he is not ready yet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, her body is flying higher and higher The sound is getting farther and farther. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Soon, my heart, my will, my body will be perfect. Your last days are not far away."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, Shirley disappeared into the dark sky, leaving a group of pale priests and ugly holy godfather. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lane frowned: "Who is that person?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three Archbishops and Bishops They also fell into deep meditation at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Father quietly closed the book and suddenly said: "It is Sogo Sotos."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;! ! ! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Laurie, the Dark Star, the Holy Word, and others suddenly opened their eyes and looked incredible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He is the only person who meets the standards now." The Holy Father hangs his books at his waist and turns his head to look at the leading mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When is the prisoner coming?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lauri immediately said: "It’s just outside It is expected that it will take an hour and a half to break the egg and join us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Father nodded silently: "First rest, then let the cage And the Aurora followed me to kill Shirley, and the grave guard and Ryan went to find Su Ge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about the Holy Grail?" Ryan asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Father shook his head: "Without the direct bloodline of Byron, the Holy Grail of the Soul cannot be revealed. The direct blood of Byron the Great has been extinct. This Holy Grail of the Soul will dissipate itself after burning the contents, and you don't have to take care of it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the Holy Grail! Just watch it dissipate?" Laurie was a little unwilling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Father looked at the huge shadow and sighed: "The appearance of the Holy Grail will only cause countless deaths and disasters. It does not represent redemption and hope, but Disillusionment and chaos."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When everyone heard this, they turned to look at the dead compatriots and comrades all in silence, and agreed to the words of the Holy Father. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
