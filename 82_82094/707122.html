			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Laurie feels the psionic volatility in the distance, and his face gradually returns to calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are not the real killers of this action, so he is not too surprised for the appearance of Hal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had thought of the possible means that Su Ge might have used. This situation was also unexpected, but he did not expect the characters to appear beyond his imagination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Then what? The vampire will not be separated, when he can escape from the Archbishop of Saru, other believers you deploy in the capital It has been dealt with by us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, he slightly reveals the two people behind him, it is the pale face, the horror actor Mary and doom Miss Anji again and again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two were helped by a heavy chain, sandwiched between clergy and without any possibility of escaping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seeing Su Ge, Mary immediately said: "Mr. Assass, you don't care about me, my life is saved, now I can take this The people are still giving you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anji didn't talk, his face was pale, and the huge fear made her speechless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge looked at the two men calmly and turned to look at Laurie and said, "It’s ridiculous justice."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Sacrificing a few people, achieving the majority, this is the eternal law of the world. These ordinary people only sacrificed their lives, and we sacrifice not only life, but also our life." There was a little glory and a demise on the old face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your arrogance limits your thinking. The moon in the sky has blinded you, and you have lost the ability to recognize true and false." Su Ge calms The answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Larry, next to the 50-year-old one-eyed archbishop issued a strong and old voice saying: "What we are guarding is this world. Compared with the world, The life of any person is small."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge looked at his weird blood red eyes and replied: "You are right. We humans are really small for the world. But don't forget that the so-called world is the world we give to this planet." Everything needs to have human beings to be meaningful, and it can be counted as true."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because of being in this world, I know better, abandon The terrorary consequences of being a human being."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Su Ge’s eyes flashed coldly: "And your distorted spirit, arrogant gesture is no longer qualified It is called a human being."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In order to transcend human beings, we can only give up human identity! This is the blood experience of countless ancestors from ancient times to the present!" Eyes, bursts of dark mist, like a monster with teeth and claws. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "However, what are the results of the great gods who have given up and become gods in the past and present? You are clear." Su Ge is not angry, his tone at this time. More down and unfortunate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He admire those sages, but also pity those sages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wrong or not, it is not your evaluation, but the future evaluation. We believe that our judgment, to get rid of you, is conducive to the development of the world. Therefore, I want to kill you!" Laurie stepped forward, and countless darkness was scattered into a strange flying monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug seems to have not heard his words, saying to himself: "It is because of this justice that you can persist in your filth, even if you You will not be confused in the darkness of the future. However, it is the justice that the heart insists on. It will gradually be assimilated by the filth when going forward. In the end, even if you still have light inside, your body has already fallen into the mud and become a part of the filth. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Su Ge raised his eyelids slightly, and calm eyes looked around all the clergy in front of him: "I admire your persistence, I respect your determination, Recognize your perseverance. But unfortunately, I want to deny everything you have done!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hurricane!" The one-eyed archbishop whispered, countless moments The bloodstain did not know where it suddenly appeared, and instantly appeared in the vicinity of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a moment, a burst of bloody smell, the smell of rot and disgusting in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Bernice and Betty were frightened and felt that their bodies seemed to dissolve quickly, as if they had been eaten by these blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even if you have God's grace, you are still a waste, you can't feel anything, you can only watch the people around you dying!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking, Laurie squinted: "Now feel the pain and despair I have experienced!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Suge turned his head slightly, he couldn't see anything, and he didn't smell anything, but he could see the pain of two little girls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he raised his right hand and said softly, "Come, hold my hand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The two girls did not hesitate, and held out their hands on Su Ge's gloves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;唰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, an indescribable flash of light flashed through, and it was seen that the bodies of Bernice and Betty made a terrible change at this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Bernice became an odd form composed of countless thin lines and ions under the influence of the unknown existence, and Betty became It seems to be a soft form like a slime. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The two girls are actually witches!?" Seeing this change, the clergymen have not changed their faces, but their hearts have wavered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only the witch can turn the body into such a non-human appearance in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The two witches are living here so brightly, but we haven’t noticed at all? Is it timid to say that they are too Look at these heresy courage?" The one-eyed archbishop muttered in his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lauri has a look on his face at this moment: "Haha, is this what you said about protection? In order to prevent them from killing us, they will The sheltered witch turned into a monster? Hahaha, it’s really ironic.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge calmly replied: "Don't use my shallow thoughts to speculate on my intentions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, all mysterious people can feel it, only The transparent light that Su Ge couldn't feel flashed again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a group of church members returned to God, they found that the two completely out of control witches actually changed back to normal, not only did they receive any injuries. Pain, and even some changes they can't describe on the body structure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's the matter!" The two bishops on the side saw this, and the vision suddenly grew by two points. When the shock was undecided, it was awesome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three archbishops of the lord level can faintly guess some situations. At this time, their eyes are on the gloves of Su Ge’s right hand, causing this change. This is the glove. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this glove a..." Laurie suddenly remembered something, his eyes suddenly widened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The characters of this level know the truth of the witch. The power of the witch is connected with the seven ancient gods. It can control the changing form of the witch and can change back. Power only has the ancient gods that correspond to the seven attributes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the seven ancient gods were imprisoned by the March goddess in the depths of the old dreams of the past, and could not interfere with the real world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the world still has the power to belong to the seven ancient gods, that is the Holy Grail! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This moment, Laurie suddenly figured it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A year and a half ago, he saw Sugna’s black gloves, but when he thought about it, he found that before and after the ancient city, Suge’s black There has been no small change in the gloves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember carefully, this change happened after Su Ge entered the palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional saints have said that the memory of all mysterious people who have participated in the ancient city of Aya has been tampered with. They thought that it was all done by the Emperor of the Storm, but at this moment Laurie suddenly thought that it was not the Storm Emperor but the Holy Grail that tampered with their memories! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The truth of the ancient city! Su Ge Sotos! You actually got the Holy Grail of our soul!" At this moment, Laurie screamed in a very strange tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to be anger, it seems to be humiliating, it seems to be excitement, it seems to be a surprise, but more is unbelievable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position of the Holy Grail in time is erratic, and all human beings cannot access and master the Holy Grail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, he is terrified to discover that Su Ge once again broke his law of cognition of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard Laurie’s weird screaming, the clerics present were first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Holy Grail!? What is the Holy Grail?" This is their instinctive reaction at this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, in the next second, all the clergymen’s eyes were like a cow, staring at the black gloves on the right hand of Su Ge, as if they were going to swallow General. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;St. Sini, who was standing aside from the crowd, didn’t have much surprise. That night, he felt the strangeness of your gloves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point he looked at Su Ge’s calm side face, complex. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ignite the pipe, let’s take a sip of two, it seems to be caught in some kind of entanglement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a moment, he turned away and left. Here, there is no fight for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cyclops are very cautiously staring at Su Ge: "No wonder the astrologers can't determine your position. You have always had the sanctuary of the Holy Grail."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge still stood there and did not move, obviously a normal to no longer ordinary people, but at this moment it gives people a heavy and steady like a mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Belongs to your holy grail? It’s really funny." Suge said, his mouth curled up, revealing some ironic smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laurie’s voice was hoarse and said: “The Holy Grail is a gift from the goddess of March to the world, and it belongs to us naturally!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear the theory, Su Ge first time The brow was slightly wrinkled and looked annoyed: "I have been very tired of this statement. Although lazy and your theory, but I only say this time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "The March Goddess you are talking about is just three ugly monsters. They are despicable aggressors for this world. You have no problem with the indigenous gods as evil gods, but don't take everything. It’s all posted in March, it’s really disgusting and disgusting.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this scene, Su Ge is like an ordinary person and has no effect. The words should be easy to make people laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now no one laughs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one dares to say that he is talking nonsense, no one dares to say that he is a god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Grail symbolizes the origin of the world, and only the gods are qualified to hold the Holy Grail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are people in the presence of the Holy Grail now in front of them, and any such person who speaks, they are not qualified to ridicule. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has such a position and has such authority. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he holds the Holy Grail! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a time, the night was depressed, the clouds passed quietly, blocking the three moons in the sky at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Innocent Betty now screamed at the sky and said, "Look! Look! Your goddess is because of your ignorance and arrogance. I was ashamed and covered my body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many clergymen instinctively looked up and looked at the three moons in the sky blocked by dark clouds, face Hidden redness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relatively mature Bernice at this time shows his own tongue as a "social elite." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the goddess, that is the goddess. Don't you say that the urine in the toilet is also the goddess?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hahaha!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing the words of these two little girls, Su Ge couldn’t help but laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The laughter is very lively, very loud, and spreads far and far in the quiet night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Looking for death!" The unscrupulous master assassin of the two people disappeared instantly, and the next second came to the two girls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The arrogant! Go to hell!" Two fanatical believers holding a dagger, a low-key look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of this kind of attack, Su Ge can't help at all, and the two girls who are professional and expert are naturally not opponents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this critical moment...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Return!" The one-eyed archbishop screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s late! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗷呜! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of the two bishops disappeared completely with a non-human horror roar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the darkness, there was a harsh chewing sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, the chewed sound of the bones echoed in the night sky with bloody smell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two master assassins, died directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one who killed them was a black monster that no one saw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monster seems to appear from the shadow of two girls. In the blink of an eye, the two masters are swallowed up with the big mouth that ordinary people can’t understand, and then disappear. not see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg still can't see the two monsters, but he knows what the two masters are missing at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
