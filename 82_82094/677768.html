			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After dealing with the problem of the ghoul, Su Ge did not go home directly, but used the cover of the night to quickly wander in the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along with the explorers who are eager for the Holy Grail documents, there have been a lot of mysterious fluctuations in the entire city, and even some places have also revealed hidden mysteries. fighting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge did not have too much contact with these battles and probes, and his more attention was placed on those rushing clergy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Church of the Holy Blood clearly felt the anomaly of this evening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The patrolman, the sinner, the exorcist, a large number of clerics, together with the ordinary special police, began a wide range of search and warning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to Su Ge, all the way to see, only the mysterious clergy, there are as many as four hundred people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They ride on the special carriage of the church and quickly sprint on the empty road in the night. The whole gear looks like a myriad of precision gears that rotate together and will shine. The mysterious defense system of the city became a monster that ate people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The dead camel is bigger than the horse. The expedition abyss has gone the vast majority of the core clergy, but I still have such a dominant power. It seems The appearance of the previous decline seems to be shown to some people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is it for?" On the roof, Sug looked Two cult members affiliated with the Brotherhood of the King of the Yellow Emperor were towed away by the clergy and their minds fell into thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three o'clock in the morning is the darkest time in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three rounds of the moon have fallen, and the sun in the day still has no meaning of silk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The storm caused by Su Ge’s intelligence has initially subsided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green gave him the name on the list, died six and was arrested four. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foreign explorers died twelve and were arrested nine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clergy began to take a break from the team one by one, leaving more than one hundred and thirty night watchers still walking in the dark world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge, who had not slept for a night, was a little tired at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get home with the help of a cloak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just jumped in through the window and was entangled in a dozen black tentacles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, a demon monster with four horns, sharp-nosed, and sly looks in front of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of this dark monster that can scare countless ordinary people crazy, Su Ge said casually: "It is quite comfortable to be so wrapped up by you." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, the body relies on its tentacles, and then both eyes close and slumber. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This monster looks at the human being after looking at it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man of his own master, it naturally does not dare to let go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge dark body turned slightly creeping, and Shirley, wearing a pink silk pajamas on the double bed, was holding the quilt to sleep sweet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carefully placed Su Ge by the owner's side, the monster's twisted and scary form disappeared into the darkness and disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exhausted Su Ge did not enter the Kingdom of God, but fell into deep sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Su Ge’s own physique seems to have a very sensitive speciality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost every time he has a normal sleep, there will be some problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time is no exception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After deep and deep sleep, Su Ge felt a violent turn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he opened his eyes, he was surprised to find that he once again returned to the old dream of the ancient city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is still the ancient city that has been covered by fog, surrounded by dilapidated buildings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bonfire is still burning, but this time, the flame seems to be more dim than before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are still seven people sitting in the seven directions, and behind the seven people is still paving the road of horror with the body and the skeleton. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The armor of these seven people seems to be more worn and bloody. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait, how seven people?" Su Ge suddenly stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last time he saw six, because he himself sat with a certain person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly looking around, Su Ge accidentally found himself sitting in the eighth direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And behind him, there is actually a road of his own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this road has no bodies, but is filled with fog and some strange radiance spheres. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge looked down at his appearance and found himself still a normal human. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a cane, with black gloves, wearing the uniform of the church in the evening bell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, the seven people turned their heads at the same time. Under each of the strange helmets, they have a pair of pupils that cannot describe the majesty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing such a pupil, Su Ge knew the identity of these armor people in a flash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That kind of look, the indifference in the eyes, is so similar to his own body and posture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that is to say, all seven of these people are genuine gods! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s been a long time since I saw it." One of the people with black and white fur on their shoulders first made a sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this voice, Su Ge’s heart moved: “Is this talking to me?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Unable to wait for Su Ge to speak, the helmet is a weird dodecahedron warrior: "Since it has arrived, you can start."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What started?” Su Ge’s heart is full of doubts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warrior with the frost on his armor said: "There is not much time, and our will has begun to dissipate."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard this, Su Ge seemed to think of something and suddenly looked up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last time I came here, there were three unspeakable ugly monsters in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time he looked up, Su Ge still saw it, and he found that these monsters seemed to be getting closer and closer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body that covers the sky, each one is too big to describe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now Su Ge still can't describe and remember the shape of these three monsters, but in the midst of it he always feels where the three monsters seem to have seen it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time sitting on the left hand side of Su Ge, a warrior with a corrugated pattern on his armor sounded: "Firewood is not enough, you must master it." The essence of this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Suge knew that the warrior was talking to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, Su Ge made his voice for the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the essence?" After all, Su Ge is a god, tone, vocabulary, and momentum are in place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dodecahedron lifted his bloody armor and pointed to the black gloves of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this movement, Su Ge’s heart was instantly in horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black gloves are the remains of the dark scorpion, and even the essence should be the essence of gauze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug is very clear, so he knows that the fighters really mean not the black gloves themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What else is there on the black glove? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nature is the Holy Grail of the Soul! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to intelligence and records, the Holy Grail is the symbol of the roots of the world, is the source of a certain kind of knowledge, is the root of people's desire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand. The Holy Grail is a remnant of the ancient gods, and at the same time, it has become the essence of the ancient gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of Su Ge’s horror, Su Ge’s right hand, a warrior with a machete and a whole body like a fog, reached out and placed it on the right hand of Su Ge On the glove, under the weird helmet, the fuzzy eyes looked at the diamond-shaped gem behind the Su Ge glove, and there was a special feeling that was unclear and unclear. It was like someone who saw something important that he had lost for a long time. same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just looked at it and didn’t talk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a long time, he raised his fuzzy head and looked at Su Gedao: "He belongs to you now, the world."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the thrilled Su Ge was so hard to return to God, eyes looked around, watching the seven lonely soldiers, the heart is still full of incredible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You also lost a lot of important things to find them." A warrior wearing a white skeleton armor said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, Su Ge took a deep breath and calmed his stiff brain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why are you here?" Su Ge asked in a tone of equality with them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be trapped, trapped in this old dream." The last soldier in gray plain armor said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge thought of what he said before he was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The ancient city is a special place, and the old dreams, as the name suggests, are some of the dreams that have remained in the past. You have just entered a past, or some residual dreams of ancient existence. Because of the powerful laws of ancient existence, A substantial existence has been formed and remains to this day."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The essence is similar to the fantasy, and is a legacy of the old times."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug asks again: "What is the monster in the sky?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"............"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug can feel that they are talking, but what he said, he can’t hear it anyway, and seems to be deliberately blocking something in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you find the essence of all of us, all the cycles will end."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"And we will also be free."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;恍惚In that, the voice suddenly flies, and all the scenery becomes blurred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a whirlwind, Su Ge felt his body fell heavily on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Young man, should you say that you are unfortunate, or should you say that you are lucky?" Full of years, the sound of the old voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug raised his head and saw the old Weiss, wearing a dilapidated dress with a lantern in his hand, standing beside him and looking down at himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge suddenly sat up and found that he had left the space and came to the dreamland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After licking his head, Su Ge felt that his memory was just a bit fuzzy, but after careful consideration, Su Ge still clearly remembered the whole thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stand up in the body, Su Ge found that the old Weiss and the last time there was no change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
