			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soul Scream is Ms. Mei’s master spell, which gives the soul a strange state through special knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young Iyeta suffered a relatively large mistake, suffered a two-second soul scream, and that pain, that kind of distortion, now It has been more than a decade and it is still the biggest fear and shadow in her life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the hand that Ms. Mei raised, this immediately awakened the most terrifying emotion in the heart of Ieta. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, she kept retreating and shouted: "Don't! Don't! I don't want!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Seeing that Ieta is out of control, Ms. Mei’s mouth is a little sneer, and she says to the two mysterious people next to her: “Take her to me.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Yieta’s betrayal, she had long predicted that the main goal of her coming this time was not to look at the fear of Iyeta, but this one that made countless organizations Electric Queen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mystery, although mastering extraordinary knowledge, is still human. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As long as it is human beings, it is inseparable from society, and it is inseparable from power and money and desire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Niya, who sat on the ground, looked up at Ms. Mei and said weakly: "You don’t know what kind of horrible existence you have provoked." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The existence of horror? Children, I have seen the existence of horror. Your so-called horror is in my opinion, but it is a common thing. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, she knelt down and stretched her finger to pick up Niya's chin. The eyes under the mask said with excitement and greed: "You The consciousness is very firm, I like the determined person. Because this allows me to taste the sense of accomplishment and conquest when tame and train you, I hope you can stick a little more, so that I can enjoy more pleasure." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Niya snorted: "He has come, do you really think that we can take both of us from his presence?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon hearing this, Ms. Mei pinched her chin: "Fully, I will let you get real liberation, whether it is from your beautiful body or from your firm will."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she finished, she slowly got up: "Take away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then two sinister female warlocks walked Come over and reach out and put Niya up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as they were about to leave, there was a cold wind blowing on the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! Boom! Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the cold wind, there are thick bells that seem to come from far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Women, what is the horror you see?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment of hearing the sound Ms. Mei suddenly looked up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the moonlight, a silhouette slowly falls from the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black-fashioned trench coat hunted in the air, bringing a chilly wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the costume of this figure, Ms. Mei’s face gradually became dignified and her eyes tightened: “The evening bell church.”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long bells are still coming out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each time the ripples of the bells spread out, they brought a cold chill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two men with masks look at each other at this time, and a burst of horrible spirits erupts, tit for tat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people are masters and have many means for special reasons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time two people stood here motionless, but a burst of horror has already erupted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other mysteries around me suddenly feel cold and spirited, feeling like they are suffocating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone knows very well that two people have begun to fight as high-end mysteries and collide with their respective knowledge systems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the vision can reach fifty or more at this time, you can see that there are countless weird things between the two people at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These things bite each other and finally dissipate into invisible psionic power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two people are motionless at this time, just like entering the general. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two clergymen standing next to Ms. Mei’s body flashed a strange purple glow, and then the body rushed directly to Su at a very fast speed. grid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two of them can ignore the lingering aftermath and knowledge, close to Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While approaching, two people took two bone knives carved from special bones from their arms and stabbed them against Su Ge’s abdomen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be careful!" Niya shouted loudly, and the body struggled to stand up, but there was no strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the two men had just approached Su Ge, Su Ge’s dark trench coat suddenly flew up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, in the darkness under the windbreaker suddenly appeared a pair of eyes burning a strange ice blue flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗷呜呜呜! ! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along with a high-pitched wolverine, a large group of pale blue mist spewed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the rush of fog, the black and white hair gradually formed, the majestic body, burning the ice blue eyes of the wildfire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the blink of an eye, a huge one-meter-and-high-high ha... The wolf appears and is in front of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of two clergy, it opened a huge mouth and spewed a large chill to freeze two people into crystal ice sculptures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the shocking thing is that these two people are obviously frozen by the horrible cold wind, but they are not dead, but they are still struggling inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The two men should be the purple moon activists. From the light of their eyes, they have strong mysterious resistance. But in contrast, their attacks Means can only use melee wrestling and can't use knowledge spells."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking is Su Ge, unconsciously, the collision of two people's knowledge is over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be heard that there is a trace of exhaustion in Su Ge’s voice, and the dual-purpose light is dim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The danger of knowledge collision is very high, just the entanglement makes Ms. Mei’s part of the corrosive knowledge into the system of Su Ge, causing the spirit of Su Ge Certain damage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in contrast, the knowledge of Suger's shock and death has entered her knowledge system at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be seen that Ms. Mei, who is opposite, has stepped back two steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s amazing that she doesn’t seem to have anything at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a traitor who can escape under the Archbishop. There is indeed some strength." Ms. Mei’s voice is still stable and seems to have not been affected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge squinted and said: "I can’t really see, the female warlock who is a heretical church of the Holy Blood, will be qualified to carry the holy mark of the Church of the Holy Blood. This is really ironic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spiritual Sug has an absolute advantage, and now the only possibility that Ms. Mei is not injured is that she has something special. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this thing is probably a holy mark. Because at the beginning, Su Ge faintly felt that she had a similar existence to herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the original element, each holy mark has a special connection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In combination with Ms. Mei’s special field, she must bear the holy mark “sky” of the Church of the Holy Blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
