			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing the ancient feelings, Su Ge fell into deep meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ancient temptation asks: "Have you really found out?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge After returning to God, he smiled and said: "I will talk about it later, how can you be with the female warlock?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ancient sense nod, will The experience at noon was briefly mentioned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You killed those two people too?" Su Ge was surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, there were a total of four people who were girls, and the two clergymen died one step earlier. The two great aristocrats today suddenly died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge looked at Gu Jue and sighed: "You are too chic, and the two should be big aristocrats."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ancient sense of arrogance and open-mindedness said: "Life is alive, don't think about the consequences and the future, you can live your life well. You want to drink and drink, you want to eat meat and meat." The road is not flat, and you will continue to move forward. When you encounter those who are awkward and poisonous, you can see that you are not pleasing to the eye, so much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon hearing this, Su Ge’s eyes slowly lit up, and the whole person’s understanding of ancient consciousness was deeper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s good to say, I think too much." Su Gehaha laughed, the voice seemed to be infected by the ancient sense, with impetuous and free and easy . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A brief understanding of Ada’s situation from the mouth of Gu Jue, Shirley is very suitable and walks with Yieta. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at this time, Yetata was pale and trembled when he walked on his legs. He almost fell a few times, and he was trembled, just like he had just climbed back from the gate. Like people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge expressed sympathy for Iyeta, because he knew that she had just climbed back and forth in the ghost gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people sat down, and Su Ge raised his hand to the night of the soul of the town to calm down the unstable Yeta. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon hearing the sacred bell, Iyeta felt back to the mother's arms, calm and calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ancient sense of the side seems to have a feeling, with a novelty in the eyes, seems to be curious about Su Ge’s means. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The calm down Iyeta first respectfully kissed the two people deeply and said seriously: "Mr. Assassin, I am willing to offer you to me." Everything becomes your loyal servant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly, satisfied: "It seems that you have not lived up to my expectations of you, recognize I made your choice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Iyeta respectfully said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge asked: "Sit down and talk about the situation of the resurrection of the female warlocks here now, and then give me a detailed roster. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understand!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next afternoon, all is Yeta Interpretation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reincarnation of the female warlocks in the capital is indeed not small, they have a lot of aristocrats through various means, officials, ministers and even some rich family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people have some known about their purpose, but most don’t know, or are addicted to their lies, or indulge in the beauty of a female warlock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all the talks, Su Ge looked down at the list in his hand and nodded with satisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Next, you continue your work, but remember to take your own safety as the highest priority." Sug said, facing Sherry A look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl waved with a hand, and a dark thing entered the shadow of Iyeta. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving Yeta and Guju, Su Ge looked outside the evening and said, "I have to go out at night."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl did not ask, nodded slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a hearty dinner, at ten o'clock in the evening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug opens the secret compartment of the gift box and takes out the set of his own evening bell church uniforms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark and decent clothes are worn on the body, and the hat with the evening bell badge is worn on the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver-gray ghost mask is fixed, and Su Ge waved, and the black robe climbed directly onto Su Ge’s body. After several changes, it became a night bell uniform. The sleeveless trench coat is perfectly attached to Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right hand of the soul of the Holy Grail flashed past, the dark windbreaker appeared outside the looming pale blue cloud pattern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A hand moves, the cane flies from the bed to the hands of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the activity and confirm that there is no discomfort, Su Ge said: "I am gone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Well, come back soon." Shirley, who read the novel, said casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge flew out of the window, the dark windbreaker hunted in the night sky, and the body of Su Ge glided in the air for several tens of meters , disappeared into the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a nearby hutong, the sergeant Sini, who is carrying a long sword, leans against the wall and takes a cigarette and takes a deep breath. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At his feet, there is a body full of blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a cult member of the Institute of Polar Studies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he faintly felt a special breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his special blessings of the Purple Moon goddess, his eyes instantly turned into a crystal purple. When he saw a shadow in the night, the corner of his mouth slowly opened: "Finally met a big fish."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, mention the sword and hurry to chase. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge, who is advancing rapidly on the roof, has noticed that Father Sini, who is tracking himself, has slightly tilted his mouth under the mask and suddenly speeds up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He came out this way this evening. The first is to determine the intensity and distribution of the mysterious defenses within the entire city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is to determine what the church has learned about itself in March. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, he is ready to explore the situation near the Amelia House. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was looking for an opportunity to go in and talk to Emilia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, he is also prepared to contact Father Cagnes as the church of the late bell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is impossible for Father Cagne to join the church in the late bell, and the faith of Father Sini is unshakable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He needs to determine Father Cagnes’ attitude towards the church in the late bells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, this guy is a very tricky existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge quickly moved forward on the house with the power of the black cloak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not go to the city center, but to the remote suburbs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he wants to play with Father Sini. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a true purple moon activist." Su Ge’s eyes glanced at Father Sini on the ground, and he was amazed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Father Sini has some faint purple lines on his legs, like a beautiful lamp, shining brightly in the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an intensive technique that Suger can't understand, and the effect is terrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest Sini, who is running on the ground at this time, can easily catch up with Su Ge flying in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After about twenty minutes, Su Ge came to a very remote, waiting for the old building to be rebuilt, and the body jumped and turned and looked chasing Father Sini, giving a cold voice: "What do you mean?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
