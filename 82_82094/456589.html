			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Su Ge took Evan out of the living room, he just saw Julie coming over, and the beautiful eyes of a pair of hooks instantly locked in Su Ge The bright red dragonfly on the hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sug, give it to me, it belongs to our Twin Alliance." Julie stepped forward and said seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s mouth cocked and asked: “Beauty, are you dreaming?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Julie finished her face, she was gloomy: "Sug, I have seen the face that I have had before, I don't want to do it for you, please know the time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It seems to have sensed the existence of Julie. The blood sacrifices in the hands of Su Ge began to struggle. A large number of steel claws continued to move, but they could not break the black gloves of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge raised his hand and slammed against the wall, and the huge force directly plunged the blood sacrifice into the wall: "Hone."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嘎嘎...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood sacrifice was slammed by this squat, and the paws were unable to swing twice. It’s like a dead big bug caught in the hands of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Juli saw that the corner of the scene couldn’t help but twitch twice, and he looked shocked: "You actually surrendered it!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the records of the Gemini Alliance, blood sacrifices, unknown sources, five secret treasures, self-awareness, temperament and greed, will not obey any human beings, if users do not continue to provide blood , it will be sucked dry, and then continue to find the next host. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About fifteen years ago, the bishop with blood sacrifices was attacked by the Vikula Ghost Fleet at sea, and this thing fell into the undead In the hands. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few years, Admiral led the fleet to break the ghost ship of Vikulas, and found a blood sacrifice in the treasure chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After being killed by several soldiers, he was sealed and placed in his own collection as a trophy by the Admiral. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was almost no hope of getting back, who knows that there is actually a thief who does not know how to live and sneak out of this thing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Julie frowned, she knew the cruelty of the thing, and she couldn’t think of what method Su Ge used to clean up this crazy greed. So obedient. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s wrist turned, and the long bloody sacrifice was rolled into a sphere and held in his hand, calmly saying: “Look at you. Don't stop in front of me when you know the face of time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, Su Ge came to her with Evan steadily, calm and elegant. It seems to be a gentleman passing by, completely ignoring Julie’s threat and hostility in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge is getting closer and closer, but Julie is afraid to act rashly, her fists are snarling, and her heart is in a difficult struggle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger’s calmness and self-confidence at this time caused tremendous pressure on her. This temperament and gas field completely suppressed her, making her feel faint in her heart. I dare not shoot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No! How can I let him go!" Julie's face gradually gloomy, and she suddenly looked up when she was determined to prepare for the shot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was discovered that Su Ge had walked out of the hallway and went down the stairs to the next level, beyond her attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whistling...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Listening to the footsteps that gradually drift away, Julie doesn’t know why Relieved with a sigh of relief, it seems that I have just experienced what life and death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold wind blew through the window with two falling leaves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After feeling the coolness behind her, she turned her head and saw that the big red dress was stuck on the back and had been soaked in sweat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn!" Julie looked unwilling, thinking for a moment, and hurriedly followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Downstairs, it is completely chaotic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The screams, screams come and go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Psychic fluctuations, bullets, bombs, spells, illusions, flying around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just coming downstairs, a corroded, unsuccessful body flew over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge did not move, the body hit the night bell, and through the transmission of vibration, like the refracted light, flew out at a different angle . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A bit too much!" In the hall, it is now a ghost, a wry, a corpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mysterious person died about seven or eight, and the average person has already died more than a dozen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Escaped about a dozen people, and the rest could not run out at this time or hide in the corner and shiver, or fall to the ground to pretend to die, pray for those Indiscriminate attacks don't fall on you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bishop Sotos!" The familiar voice sounded, and Jike didn't know where to appear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Need help?" Although Jike has a lot of blood on his body, it is blood of others, still calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug will push Evan: "Help me send him safely home, there is nothing wrong with you."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jick looked down at the red metal ball in Su Ge’s hand and smiled slightly: “Yes.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Sug! Be careful!” Evan snarled at the air with his eyes closed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug saw this and couldn’t help but laugh: "Don't worry!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jike The preparation was very full, and with Evan three rounds and two windings disappeared into the hall, and I did not know how he went out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A violent explosion occurred on the platform in the distance, and several ordinary people hiding there suddenly became purple and black, and countless worms crawled in their bodies, losing their lives in struggles and screams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a dead bomb, the Necromancer is really annoying.” Su Ge frowned and was unhappy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although he does not mind killing, it is very uncomfortable for him to kill ordinary people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gaze swept, and Suge locked into a young man in a black trench coat and a pistol. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time the young man was excited and took out a dead bomb and shouted: "Kill everyone, all the treasures are mine." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of the eyes, I saw a pair of men and women hiding in the corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mallo is crying at this time, shouting: "Don't kill me! Don't kill me! I give money! I have a lot of money!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Money? Laozi’s most annoying thing is that you are rich!" The young man’s eyes greedily swept and fell to the white-faced Judy. Ruan said: "Smelly scorpion! I want you to know that it is useless to have money!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking out, this young man seems to be a mysterious person before Was hurt by women who worshipped gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Kill him, I will kill you for a while!" The young man looked stunned and took out the pistol. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Give you! Give it to you! Don't kill me!" At this time, Marlow will launch Judy, yelling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adult! How much do I have for this kind of woman! Give it to you, don't kill me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Judy heard this, his face turned blue, and he turned his head to look at Marlow, the look, the disappointment and desolateness that could not be said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The youth suddenly became violent: "Grass! The most annoying thing for Lao Tzu is you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;bump! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A shot went down and directly knocked Marlow's head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serena who is not far away sees this, his face is gloomy: "I killed you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The fortress is not the most mysterious person who slaughtered ordinary people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Serena was ready to rush, she snorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A dazzling silver flashed past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the gaze of many mysterious people around, the dead warlock’s bomb has not been thrown out, and it was pierced by a two-meter-long pistol. Head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, piercing his head is not enough. The huge force flew two meters away from his body and nailed him directly to the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the Necromancer eyes are wide, and I don’t know what happened, I have no life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My Day! What is this trick!?" asked a young mysterious man in a gray suit. Moore felt that the pistol seemed familiar and his eyes swept slightly, just as he saw Sug walked down the stairs to the wall where the youth were fixed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Judy touched the blood on his face, staring at the mysterious man who was nailed to the wall, dead, surprisingly calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't want to die, give me the truth, here is Bain City! My Bain City!!" The cold and solemn, the voice of no anger and awesome It sounded in the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone heard the sound and immediately turned to look at the sound, just to see Su Ge walking along the aisle to Judy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a wave of waving, under the gaze of everyone, the pistol nailed to the wall was summoned, flew out of the wall, and returned to Suge In the hands, the sleek and swiftly turned into a silver-gray cane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Judy standing on the side saw that it was completely stupid, sitting on the ground with physical weakness, and his heart was filled with countless emotions, and he could not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selena in the distance was shocked and murmured: "Team...Captain, what is that knowledge?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mur's eyes wide open, silence three Second, the succinct answer: "I don't know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a good time in the heart of Julie standing on the second floor fence, muttering: "This guy, and Compared with the last time I met, it was not a person!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Which onion are you? Less than the boss here!" After a short silence, one A young man with a jazz hat and a denim suit doesn’t know when to mix in, yin and yang say strangely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of Su Ge’s eyes looked at him indifferently and asked, “How do you want to die?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to die your ass!" The young man picked up the gun and looked disdainful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge heard the previous step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the falling of the footsteps, the thick bells came out and slowly echoed in the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The sea burial."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge said four words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, Moore grabbed Serena and slammed back, feeling the danger of terror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呃呃呃呃...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, under the watchful eyes of many mysterious people, The young man who was just very confident was covering his neck with his hands, and his body struggled constantly. It seemed like drowning, his face was pale, his throat was constantly squirming, and his eyes were extremely painful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This...this is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this scene, everyone’s heart suddenly Trembling, the instinctive step back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No more than three seconds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
