			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's a beautiful action, a beautiful sniper!" The backed Hayden screamed at the gun and carefully observed Sugg's reaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge felt a tingling sensation in his head, and with a stun, the sounds of Hayden were far and near. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beatly bite the tip of the tongue, and a burst of emotion that people couldn’t help but call into Suger’s brain, suddenly let the spirit of dizziness get a little concentrated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The dizziness of this guy is not pretending." Hayden confirmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up and Sugg just saw two bloody red disgusting tentacles suddenly appearing on the cross section of Hayden's broken arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He directly docked his arm that had been cut off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second strange thing happened, the two meat tentacles quickly contracted into the muscles of the arm, a few breaths, the arm that was cut off The docking is completed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn! The liver that I just ate had a problem!" The human body could not do this, which made Sugg think of it immediately. Before that, Hayden ate the liver of the animal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge will certainly not watch the show. While seeing the tentacle, Su Ge’s body begins to move forward, and the arm is forced to directly direct the cane to the sea. The body of the board, blocking his movements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heiden saw such an extremely corrupt attack, and his heart smirked, and the body quickly rolled to the side to avoid the throwing sword and put the pistol into the waist. In the meantime, take a short knife with a strange purple light from the back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just this short knife that cut the second night of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s stupid to throw the weapon out!" Hayden opened his mouth and smiled, screaming at Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This guy's psionic power has bottomed out. It should be that the strange ability to just evade my bullets is too expensive. But now his defense and attack methods are Can't use it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It takes about thirty seconds for the left hand to recover, and the weapons are thrown out. I see what else you have."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking in the heart, rushing up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two met, and Hayden shorted his knife to the left side of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug turned away and grabbed the sharp edge with the right hand of the black glove. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!" Hayden's short knife flipped and slammed to Su Ge's palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This knife has a violent corpse poison, not to mention the wound, even if it is contaminated with skin will be poisoned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you want to hold the knife with your hand? Then let you hold it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This side The spirit of the grid is concentrated, and a short knife is held, and the finger is stuck in the groove of the back of the knife to prevent it from breaking free. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Looking for death!" Hayden sneered, and the blade slammed down, trying to cut Sug's gloves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, he suddenly found that the blade was cut on the glove like a steel, and the force was not forced to cut. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn! What's going on?" Hayden felt this and his heart was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug's mouth with a handful of smiles, his left hand opened his hand and quickly caught his neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hyden is not to be outdone, and reaches out and grabs Suger’s neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To die together!" Hayden looked awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge's wrist fretting: "Take who will die first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;噗嗤... ...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heiden suddenly felt a stinging sensation in his neck, and then his mouth opened and spit out a large mouthful of blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a time, he felt weak, and the hand that was just about to squeeze the neck of Su Ge was unable to put down, and even the knife could not hold it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body was unable to move back two steps, Hayden discovered that he did not know when there was a sharp sleeve sword under Su Ge’s wrist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s also this sleeve sword that pierces his neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You..." The throat was hurt, and Hayden opened his mouth but couldn't speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger kept the short knife at the side, and when he was ready to go forward, Hayden suddenly took out a dead bomb from his arms and opened the insurance directly. Still in front of the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn!" Su Ge’s eyes slammed wide, his legs tightened, and he jumped three meters away like a frog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the jump, Sog did not hesitate to sneak two turns in a row, then stood up and continued to run out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug can no longer afford this dead bomb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The explosion sounded and the purple smoke spread out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug stood silently over ten meters and looked at it: "This disgusting thing is really tricky!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When the smoke is gone, go and recycle his body and soul!" Su Ge sighed at this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unable to wait for Su Ge to relax completely, he suddenly found a figure rushing out of the dust, it was Hayden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Hayden actually ignored the fatal wound on his neck and bowed his head and quickly fled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn! It’s a Necromancer!" Su Ge’s face suddenly sagged, and he lifted his legs and caught up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heeding in front of him ran, moving his left hand, and pushing a finger bullet into the gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turning to Su Ge is a shot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is a pity that he is seriously injured today. Although he is alive and kicking, he has a big discount. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bullet was a few meters away on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn!" Hayden groaned and took out a bullet to prepare to fill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Su Ge pulled his clothes and pulled out the moon from the arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What?!" When Suger took the moon out of Fran, Hayden felt a tingling scalp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one of the signs of inspiration warning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly turned back, in the sun, he saw a revolver flashing with cold silver. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revolver is long and beautiful, like a craft, and people look at only three words in their minds, gorgeous, sophisticated, deadly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under his commentary, Su Ge’s body rushed forward, and a footstep rushed out of the distance of more than three meters, aiming at himself with a revolver. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I also have a gun!!" Su Ge's low voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not good!" In an instant, Hayden launched all his psionic powers, and his hands quickly waved in front of him to draw three inverted triangles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While he was painting, Su Ge was aiming to launch directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment the bullet came out came to Hayden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can blur the way to see Hayden, with a triangular shield with a stepped overlay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top of the smallest, the largest of the last. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bullet that was fired hit the shield, and the first layer was broken after the bullet was blocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
