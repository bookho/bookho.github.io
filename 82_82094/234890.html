			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bern City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the bloody month, everyone is watching the sky, and the look is full of shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even at this moment, the horrible monsters are no longer able to attract their attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呼呼呼<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;凛冽 The cold wind is raging in the entire circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This cold wind is extremely horrible, with crystal white particles in the wind. This kind of particle has the horrific mythical icyness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horrible giant worms around the body were blown by the wind, and instantly turned into a huge ice sculpture, crystal clear, like a frozen for thousands of years years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This cold wind is not frozen, frozen is mysterious, spiritual, spiritual, all intangible energy, even life, death can Frozen!" On the ground, Ron stared at the cold wind in the air, his face was very shocking and muttered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calling...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More horrible cold winds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few breaths, the entire city of Bain was completely frozen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breaked streets, collapsed buildings, even burning flames, shivering residents in the room, and a small amount of madness but no death, the citizens who continue to wander Wait, all turned into a statue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the source of this horrible cold wind is the huge warship covered in ice in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s an old-fashioned sailing warship that looks very old, but it’s a bit smashed, but it floats in the air in a strange form. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is surrounded by horrible white wind and frost, and can feel the bitter chill from far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What a ghost thing!" Ron stared at the sky with his eyes wide open, his eyes filled with horror and his heart, and his head was running wildly, but he found himself unable to think. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sky, the Lost Bonded Blood Library quickly moved away from the monsters, while carefully evading the battleships flying to Adeline. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the ground, when other people were shivering, Sears and Bernice were full of energy, and they were so excited that they pointed out loud in the sky. Said: "Look! Look! This is the battleship of my Lord, my Lord heard my prayers and came to the world!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What!?" Hearing this, the side has been very calm and calm, Luke and Clausen of the high-profile people with wide eyes, the face is not calm, full of horror and shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two witches are heads high at this time, and they open their arms with pride and enthusiasm: "Look! This is the only belief in the church service of our late night!" The Lord of Storms and Death, the only true God of Glen and the Abyss, the ruler of dreams, the dominator of death, the master of the fog!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aside from this side When she suddenly jumped in her heart, because she was the first time she heard the whole god of her faith. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hurry up!", the door of the Holy Blood Library opens, and Rogan first pulls Marx and Bobby, who almost fainted past, and The crowds waved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the face of such cold weather, Luke and Clausen had no choice but to run in and take temporary refuge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hills and Bernice followed, and both of them have been systematically trained, knowing that their most important task today is not to appreciate themselves. The heroic position of faith, but to find the place where the most people are the one to preach! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the sky, the hoarfrost gradually gathered, and finally formed a continuous open ice portal at the end of the ship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look! Look! Our avatar has appeared!" Just entering the church, Bernice suddenly pointed the sky at the ship through the window Say loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Lord? The evening church!?" asked Roland's temptation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hills nodded: "Yes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, and the sky suddenly remembered a just heavy, long, thick bell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bells spread from the sky, just fear, nervous, confused people at this time actually magically relaxed and quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This bell..." Luke and Clausen thought of something at the same time, their eyes sparkling with brilliant brilliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bow, a silver-gray armor, the huge cloak behind the scarlet keeps flying with the cold wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wearing a mask, holding a long gun, the body gives an indescribable stalwart and martial arts, burning the eyes of the ice blue flame staring at the monster on the ground, giving People are extremely great, while at the same time, a sense of reliability is born. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because everyone thinks that this person is sheltering himself and destroying the monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Anthony, Sister Marlene, Father Hank and other clerics did not speak, the face was dignified through the window and looked at the bow of the majesty, even arguably Great figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In this world, is there really such a perfect body?" Sister Marlene touched her chest and muttered to herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have vowed countless times inside, after seeing this body, she actually has an indescribable feeling of heart, at the moment she feels everything in her heart Thoughts are filled with this figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogen stared at the body and turned to tempted and asked: "You said this is the embodiment of your Lord, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benedict nodded slightly: "Yes, my Lord is a true deity. Under normal circumstances, his posture is something that I and other ignorant people cannot look directly at."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adeline nodded in her heart: "Don't talk about the gesture. I was almost insane when I heard the voice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;While everyone was still thinking, Roland suddenly squatted and said, "I want to join the church of the late bell. It is the hope that you brought to me in this desperate time. Even the great gods have lowered their miracles. I am willing Relying on the Lord's embrace!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack immediately followed: "Thank you for saving my life, now your Lord has saved my life again. From now on, your Lord is my Lord, and I will convert to the church of the evening bell and offer my most sincere faith."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other clergy see I didn't say anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, they are not qualified to say this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the city is like this, the initiators of the tens of thousands of inhabitants are the bishops of the Church of the Holy Blood! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time they silently clenched their fists, their faces were hot, and they felt like others were looking at their own eyes as if they were cutting a knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I would also like to join!" Orson took a deep breath and followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the partners of the entire city’s justice took the lead, and the rest of the remaining residents who were rescued produced a clear herd mentality, followed by kneeling down and said that they would believe in this. A master of storms and death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sudden arrival of so many believers is far beyond the expectations of the two witches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people squinting, big eyes and small eyes, actually do not know how to answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adelin wants to talk, but she is not a clergyman and has never thought of any suitable words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, Luke’s old fritter stood up at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luke’s slight sternness, a stern expression of a god’s stick: “I believe that my Lord can sense your piety and thoughts, but join the church. It is a sacred thing. He represents the principles and creed of our life. You can make up your mind to be a good thing, but now is not a good time to accept you. After this crisis has passed, your thoughts are calm and firm, we are doing Decision, how?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
