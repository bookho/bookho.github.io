			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At nine o'clock in the evening, in the third floor of the special bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug sat on the bed, beside him, Shirley, who was naked in the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger’s hands were gently put on her back like a suet jade, kneading. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the process, you can see that Su Ge’s hands are constantly giving a slight jitter, which drives the Shirley skin to produce constant jitter and ripples. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley closed his eyes and enjoyed and satisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger’s approach may not be superb, but his shocking knowledge has given a great bonus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So today’s hands are like two high-speed vibrations that cause Shirley’s flesh to shake, the kind of comfort from the inside out makes snow Lil is very satisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge pressed and said: "Now I can say it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley Ern said, casually said: "It has always been a small white sheep, although it is called Aries, but it has nothing to do with the sheep."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She still has What other identity?” Su Ge asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley's body squirmed, indicating that Su Ge's hands were down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Su Ge’s hands are not hesitant to hold on her pretty round buttocks, continue to mobilize their own vibration knowledge, while slowly moving their hands toward their legs , kneading. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl continued: "She only has a quarter of human descent, so she only has the form and appearance of human beings. As for her blood vessels, rogue It’s the incomparably pure dragon blood.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Dragon Blood!?” Hearing this Su Ge’s eyes, his hands stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well!?" Shirley's eyebrows picked one, and opened his left eye and looked at Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge’s hands continued to work immediately, and his curiosity had been caused by a great hook. If she was suddenly in a bad mood, he would not sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shelly closed her eyes comfortably and said: "Accordingly, she is indeed not qualified to cause my attention to her. I was working on it. The way to make the Holy Grail of the Soul, through the record of Byron's Travels, I found your man, Jerous."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is the only one of Byron the Great Pure blood, he can make the Holy Grail of the soul fully visible. When investigating Gerlos, I noticed this pure white sheep."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug Question with doubts: "Is there a relationship between Gerlos and Emilia?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The two of them are comrades, or friends who are sympathetic. They The identity of each of them was very special. At the beginning, in order to resist the erosion of the blood and the whispers of the ancient gods, Gerlos chose to enter the bloody maze to become a demon hunter. And Emilia was born a monster with a scale, being a The exorcist holy god found it secretly raised, and at the age of seven she became a human And completely inherited the memory and partial power of her ancestors."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At the same time, the Holy Father has a very good education and protection for her, and the Holy Father knows deeply if the Holy See Knowing her identity, what kind of horrible life this poor child will suffer. Finally, he sent Shirley into the Star Heaven as his illegitimate child, and committed suicide by destroying the Holy Father's precepts." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His saint's skeleton was refined into a six-level secret treasure, and his soul became the fireman who guarded the maze of blood, eternal in the maze Lieutenant, can't be released."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this Su Ge's face is moving, he suddenly found that those who are stubborn are not pedantic, they It will also violate or even deceive the church because of its creed and wishes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart secretly expressed the highest respect for this holy godfather, and then some doubts asked: "How do you know these things? Since they are two of them Secret, the entire Holy See does not know!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl sneered: "Don't compare that group of waste with me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge squeezed his hands more hard and smiled and said: "Of course, I am just a little curious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strong power is just a good hand, plus constant subtle The shock and pinch of Shirley were so comfortable that they came out, so she decided to give her man more gifts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She inherited a lot of knowledge and memory of the ancient dragons, which made her have the wisdom and the heart that ordinary people can't match since childhood, she secretly through the relationship of the stars in heaven After investigating the true identity of Gerlos, after many temptations, she told her everything to Gerlos."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The two are very lonely each other, And the incomparable souls meet, just like the two people who met in the cold wind, the warmth and intimacy can melt the incomparably strong inner walls." Su Ge can feel the two people encountering companions, or confidants It is that kind of ecstasy and happiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley nodded and said: "Jerouss swears by his blood and soul that he will not tell these things to others. Unfortunately, humans will eventually There is a limit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The last time you hijacked Jelos to your field, you not only modified his memory, but even got his memory. ?" Su Ge a glimpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley asked faintly: "Is this difficult?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shirley opened her eyes and said with a sarcasm: "Oh! I forgot. Your god is an ignorant coward, what death, what hoarfrost is really boring to die, your mind is unimaginable." My current theocracy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"........." Suger is speechless, but there is no way to refute it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Sherry said, he now only knows that Shelly’s form is similar to himself, and in his own special space, he has his own avatar incarnation. And the kingdom of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for Shrell’s privilege, he suddenly found himself completely unaware of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg wants to ask directly at this time, but sees Shirley’s weird look but does not say it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can feel that if he asks about it now, some are stupid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley never took the initiative and deliberately told him something, only to go with the flow, met, or talked about something, active in Su Ge After questioning, I can say something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for how much can be said, it depends on her interest and the service attitude of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Su Ge silent for a few seconds, continue to ask: "Continue to say Emilia! You said she has a quarter of human descent, Then which dragon is her parents? In today's world, can you count the dragon fingers that exist in the world? And how does this mate? A quarter of human blood, her parents, grandparents and only one human? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl said calmly: "The dragons breed differently than humans. They are not like human embryos, nor are they legendary spawning." It is transmitted directly through the soul. Because the body is the limit of existence, the soul does not. As long as the soul is strong enough, it can gradually make the body gradually stronger, and thus enter a new form."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" According to the news that Gerlos knew, her grandfather was a very powerful mystery, and should be at least a dominator, so the soul is terrible. He met her grandmother when she was about to die. , a white dragon. Two people have completed the soul combination Born her father, a mixed-race."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"White Dragon? The size of the dragon that is similar to Govins?" asked Su Ge. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley laughed and said: "Impossible. The dragon that is not dead is named Storm, but it is not a real storm dragon. It The race is an immortal dragon. Only the immortal dragon can be strengthened by the immortal dragon scales, and the length of the body can be broken beyond the limit of 50 meters. The normal gray dragon, white dragon and green dragon are the dragons. The size is generally between 20 meters and 50 meters."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Immense Dragonscale?" When I heard these four words, Su Ge’s mind instantly reminded me of it. In the sun, it was incredibly strong, shimmering in the horrible momentum of the icy bronze-colored giant scales. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The situation of heaven and earth in that era did not know. The world’s first human being communicated the thunder and flames of the world with the power of the soul, and opened up the heavens and the earth. In that era, the dragons already existed. The scales they have experienced through countless thunderfires have a sacred world rule to have a more advanced form and become an immortal form comparable to the gods."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
