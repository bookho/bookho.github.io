			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With three diaries and money, Su Ge quietly walked out of the apartment without any interference or movement in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain’s deposit is quite a lot. Su Ge’s simple look, there are five hundred francs, which is not a for any family. small amount. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then two people took a bus to Blade Street, Aibo’s home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. 4120, Knife Street, not far from Sussex’s Beth Street, it takes about half an hour to walk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a fairly old apartment. From the outside, the front yard of the apartment is a little messy. From the perspective of clothing, the people living here are more complicated. Most of them are workers who have entered the city from the countryside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is relatively dirty, the people here are very simple and peaceful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The simplicity and hard work of rural people have been well passed down, and Su Ge can see hope for the future and efforts for a better life in the eyes of these people. Look like. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of eye, this way Sugg once saw it, it was seen in the eyes of his parents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s rare that Shelly didn’t feel bored and annoyed about the situation here, which is so clean for her, I don’t know how dirty others are. People are very rare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley noticed Suger’s accident and explained casually: “Don’t compare my vision with those of the inferior bugs. Or, I care more about the more advanced level."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of her looking up and looking around, looking at the women who are washing clothes, playing back and forth The child, the corner of his mouth reveals a faint smile: "At least their souls look very clean, and there are countless grades than those who are so celebrities."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Sogra walked her to the second floor and knocked on the door of 204. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Standing in front of the door, through the soundproofing is not a good door panel can hear what seems to be talking inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge’s ears moved slightly and saw four people inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two women, two men. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the footsteps, the door is opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening the door is a woman who looks like she is about 50 years old, looks old and is wearing a worn-out home dress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After opening the door, the woman’s look is: “The two are...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge Smile and ask: "Is this the home of Aibo?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The women nodded, and some doubts said: "My son went to work in the field, not yet. At home."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be seen that the mother still does not know that her son has passed away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled and said, "Hello, I am a friend of Aibo. I have passed by here, so I will come and see."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Friends!?" The women smiled happily and opened their bodies: "Come on! Come in!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Into the door, the room is not large, less than 60 square meters of small two rooms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time in the living room, there are two young people in suits sitting in chairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opposite is a girl in a shabby black dress with a big golden braid and a freckled face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl looks about twenty years old, although her face is average, but with a gentle, focused atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sardin, you have to think clearly, this is a great opportunity to join the steam guild. If you miss this time, you have to wait two years later. "At this time a young man said seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl's face is tangled, very ugly, the fingers pinch the skirt, a look is embarrassing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge curiously asked: "What's wrong with this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women said with a little pride: "The steam guild workshop, after entering, has the opportunity to become Member of the Steam Guild."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In turn she sighed: "But the tuition is too expensive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "How much?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One year needs a hundred gram." The woman replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paying one hundred francs at a time is a huge burden for such a family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, the two young people also noticed the two people of Su Ge, smiling slightly to show friendship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the girl is still holding her head down, her teeth biting her lip, and she is deeply entangled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug did not interfere: "Ms. Sardin, we are still going to other houses to talk, don't interfere with them."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a woman apologized and said sorry, she could only take two people to take a rest in her bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next conversation, Su Ge directly cut into the theme that he is coming to repay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said that Aibo has saved his life and made himself a success today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today came over and wanted to express gratitude, so I handed over the money bag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the women took the bag of money, they suddenly opened their eyes and sat down on the bed, not returning to God for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Su Ge explained the money without any problems, then said that the money is nothing but for himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women are not stupid, although they are a little embarrassed in the heart, but in this eye of the future that determines their daughter's future, it is still uneasy to accept. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, she has no other choice now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She doesn’t care if there is a problem with the money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as her daughter can enter the Steam Guild, she doesn't care what she will face in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Su Ge came out of the bedroom again, the three people seemed to have finished talking. The two young people said with a pity: "That's a pity, we will Put your difficulties and Ms. Tesla."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tesla!?" Hearing the name of Sugerton. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Su Ge went forward and asked: "Ms. Tesla, who is said to be the Queen of Electrical Appliances, Niya Tesla?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two young men smiled and nodded: "Yes, do you know Ms. Tesla?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sug smiled: "We are good friends."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"????"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;There are not just two young people, but also the mother and daughter of Sardin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug continues to ask: "She is responsible for the academic inspection of the Imperial Capital this year, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Two young nods nodded, tempted to ask: "You are..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled and said: "My name is Odin Asa Xin, I will have a look at her when I have time. It’s been almost two years since I last time.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two young people still have some reactions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pillars of the Steam Guild now, the great electric queen, Ms. Tesla’s good friends so much? Can you meet it casually? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women stood at the door of the bedroom and looked at Su Ge’s back to return to God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug turned to look at this elegant, focused girl: "Are you the sister of Aibo?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
