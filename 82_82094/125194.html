			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time of the whole dream, Su Ge is used to analyze the relationship between the bell and the psionic power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When feeling that his consciousness is about to wake up, Su Ge sorts out the important information he got during this time, sitting on the throne and closing his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you open your eyes, the first thing you see is the familiar ceiling, turning your head slightly, seeing the second squatting on the side, looking at yourself with your mouth open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The neck is still very stinging, but the spirit has improved significantly, and even the mind turns more agile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" After deep learning through the vision of the gods in the dream, it will indirectly affect my real world thinking and brain through the analytical knowledge. If this continues, Maybe someday, my brain can be side by side with the god of dreams."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, at this rate, it won't take too long, about 100,000 years is almost the same..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Self-spoken two words, Su Ge sat up and heard the two women in the living room sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ada, who is the other?" Su Ge got curious and got out of bed, put on cotton slippers and pushed the door out. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the living room, Ada is talking to a nun with a pair of armor robes, which looks neutral, with two short knives at the waist, and a heroic and refreshing nun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After seeing Su Ge, the nun’s face showed a gratifying smile: “Since Su Ge is fine, I have to leave.”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Idaton said with a pity: "Respected Marlene Sister, it’s my pleasure to talk to you for so long."<br /><br />&nbsp Sister Marlene said with a smile: "I am the one who feels honored. The goddess actually has such believers in the world, which makes my heart full of hope and light."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg said thank you here: "Thank you for sending me back, amount...Ms. nun."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh..." Hearing this title, Marlene smiled and said, "Call me Marlene."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, Marlene looked Su Ge’s bruise on his neck said: “Your bravery, your loyalty is obvious to all. This pay and risk will be rewarded in the near future.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp People are realistic, even if it is Marlene, a devout nun, they know that it is impossible to get a person’s true loyalty by faith alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, belief + interest is ok. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge heard a smile and said: "This is what I should do, it is my duty."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your intelligence is very important. This matter has been the sole responsibility of Master Geros. Then you can rest at home with peace of mind. I should leave, and I need me on the farm. Help." Marlene is ready to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Su Ge and Ida sent Marlene away, Ada looked worriedly at Su Gedao: "The work of police detectives should not be safer." How are you suffering from such a serious injury?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No way, you must fight with the gangsters at a critical moment, or there will be many innocent citizens dying. Su Ge makes an image metaphor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sit down, I will wipe you again." Ada said to take out the medicine chest, hold some cotton wool with tweezers, and get medical alcohol. Apply to the wound on the neck of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking close at hand, Ada’s beautiful face, Su Ge jokingly said: “It’s a pity that you are a nun, or I believe you are coming to you. The person must be the happiest person in the world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ada eyes squinted and said with a smile on his face: "Thank you for your compliment, but I I have decided to dedicate everything to the goddess."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, how come you are so early today?" It’s only two o'clock in the afternoon, under normal circumstances. Ada will take six points to get home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Today, the city government has docked the work of the tramp, and the dean gave me a special action leave. After the treatment, I can go home directly." Ada The tone is light and the mood seems very good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the smear, Su Ge stood up and warned: "Ada, you are still far from those tramps, those who have, help, but don't get too close."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ada touched Su Ge’s head and said, “Don't worry, kind little guy, I have a measure.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people talking The doorbell rang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who is this time? It should not be Evan." Ada said and turned to open the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door opened, and Su Ge first heard the gentle and polite inquiry from Aidana, and then heard the sound of Bart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hurry and turned and walked over, just to see Bart standing in the doorway with Jike, with a trace of weird look at Ada. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ada! Let me introduce you, this is the businessman I used to act as an ally of the Alliance, Bart Phil (yes, here is The pseudonym on the surface.)" Su Ge hurried forward to introduce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He instinctively does not want pure Ada to touch these twisted things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ada listened with a sigh of relief and said with enthusiasm: "Come on, Mr. Phil!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bad took the hat politely after the ceremony, said in the language of the Union Empire: "Hello, beautiful and pure lady, I am sorry, I have something to invite Su Ge and I to go out for a while, I will temporarily I didn't enter the house."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge translated to Bart and then turned to ask: "What?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart said: "We have two new colleagues in the Chamber of Commerce and need you to help them get familiar with the situation around them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear this Su Ge’s heart was shocked and he knew that he would say two witches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug immediately turned his head and said: "Ada, I have money to earn, just some time today, I will temporarily give them a translation, estimate I came back at six or seven in the evening."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
