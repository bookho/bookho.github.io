			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battleship showed half of the body, and the volley floated in the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inexhaustible souls around the world are like a myriad of elves around the battleship, swimming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that countless people are welcoming what great existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Warship!? Whose battleship!? Why is it here!" Several cultists at the Institute of Polar Studies are somewhat mad, muttering Speaking to himself, it seems like crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The truth is that they are indeed on the verge of madness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of these four people, just the spirit of the sky has risen by five points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moustache man swallowed his mouth in a difficult way, and he was so sad that he said: "We must try to get out of here as soon as possible."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black-spotted warlock returned to God, clenched his fists and stared at Kas and said, "If you don't solve him, we can't live without this dream space. Just he A certain summoning ceremony was carried out and the battleship was summoned."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Chief! We...what should we do!" The female warlocks on the side were pale Asked the trembling voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time their spiritual vision has also grown to varying degrees, two points less, four more points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The growth of spirituality imposes a huge burden on their spirit, and rationality is swayed by fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, they need a strong and strong backer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black spot warlock is as stinky as the temper, but at this time it is very calm, calm analysis: "Don't be afraid! Waste! This warship is from The other worlds have been summoned, and now we can't interfere with our world. It's just a savage paper tiger. Now that we have killed those traitors and initiators, we can go back!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black-spotted warlock is very clever. A few words not only calm other people, but also aim at the enemy, inspiring everyone's most terrifying desire to survive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, for a moment, everyone who survived faintly red eyes, staring at Kas, like seeing the evil of fresh meat Wolf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, their threats and actions have been unable to shake the hearts of six people like Iyeta and Duke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because at this time their six people were filled with the huge battleship in their eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike the cultists, at this time they stood under this huge miracle warship, they not only felt no oppression and fear, but felt it The peace of mind is peaceful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to be hiding in the safest corner of the world, as if hiding behind his father's broad and strong body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this the battleship of the Great Lord?" Duke’s eyes are like a child who saw the new world, his face full of awe, and more More is curious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cass nodded slightly: "This is just one of the many battleships of the Great Lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Great...the great Lord is on this warship?" asked the voice of Yieta. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course not, these despicable cockroaches are not considered, they do not even qualify for my gaze." Kass said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That..." Ieta also planned to ask, but was interrupted by Kass, looking at the sky with devout look: "Now don't say more, don't Ask more, with the highest worship and piety in your heart, witness the infinite power of my Lord!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kill! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When several people talked, the many cultists across the house were red-eyed and rushed toward it like crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at this group of mad dog cultists, several people are very calm at this time, without any fear, or even any waves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a thick, sacred, distant, solemn bell did not know where it came from. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bell has a powerful power that cannot be described. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the bell was heard, the body of this cultist stayed in place for a moment, and his face was frightened and feared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the moment when the bells were affected, all of them were inspired by the explosion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feeling is that they dare to move forward, and all of them will die very miserable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unsettled people looked at each other and saw the fear on their faces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be afraid! Kill them! This is the only chance we can live!" The black-spotted warlock shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear this, everyone is hesitant, but the desire to live gradually overcomes fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just when they regained their courage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗷呜呜呜呜...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A burst of high-pitched wolverines from the sky Come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people couldn’t help but look up at the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this moment, the fighting spirit and courage that just ignited were completely crushed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the edge of the huge battleship in the sky, there were a lot of knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knights armed with spears, the solemn silver-gray armor, covered in a face with a pair of pure gold quirky eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knights of these knights are riding on the giant wolves they have never seen before, the incomparable gods and prestige. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These wolves are three meters high and five meters long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole body has a strange blue light and fog, and the body is covered with ghosts and frosty armor, and the body is cold like ice. It’s as cold as a wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dozens of knights are holding a reins, armed with a weapon, riding a giant wolf on the edge of a warship overtime. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dozens of pairs are full of contempt and cold golden eyes, looking down at the ground, exudes a horrible horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This kind of momentum...this breath!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;here here, always lucky The moustache man and the black-spotted warlock's face are instantly pale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, they finally understand what kind of horrible existence they are facing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The filthy from the world!" The indifference of the voice in the sky came again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone can hear, the sound comes from the mouth of a knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of the knight continues to come:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the one who hates hate! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who are evil! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who are evil! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A greedy person! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart of the people! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Step into the Kingdom of God! Defile the filth of the kingdom of God! Despise the leader of my master! just now! The Lord of the Storm, the King of Wild Hunting will give you the sanction of destruction! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the voices of the knights, everyone’s face is pale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calling...呜呜呜......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
