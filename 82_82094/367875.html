			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Suge to find himself, Lance seems to be inductive and asks: "Do you want me to help you improve your psionics?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded: "Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the previous contact, Su Ge sensed the blue The horrible psionic power, his expert mystery, spiritual energy and even four or five times the master psionic power, is a very horrible and abnormal thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Sog feels that there should be some ways in which Lance can directly improve the psionic power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lance bluntly said: "This secret method, even if it is not available to us in our Elf Order, it can be said to be The core of our elf education group."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded: "I can guess, but I must now use this method to reverse the situation here. Otherwise, after the birth of the Son of the Great God, let alone the city, that existence may even cause the destruction of the entire country."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lance was caught in meditation and did not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger continues to say: "And you just said, you said that there are not a few people in your elf group can get it, you are saying "can get "It is not "qualified." This means that the threshold of this method is very high, and there may even be huge risks. Although it is the secret method of your elves, there are not many people inside the church. The ability to achieve, I am right!!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; heard this, Lance's spirit shocked, looked up and saw Su Ge silent nodded: "Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This means that this method is not a big secret in the Order. Generally, the regular members of the Order know that But no one can pass trials, or have no courage to try. Strictly speaking, it is not something that requires too much confidentiality, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;兰Squeezed his fist and continued to nod. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge took a deep breath and said in a positive tone: "Lance, I know that you are a real knight, I am not a knight, strictly I don’t even think it’s a good person. But I hope that you can help me here. I don’t want people in this capital city to be sacrifices for evil rituals. I want to kill those damn cultists!”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Langston was listening to this, the purple eyes were stunned and looked at Su Ge. He gnawed his teeth: "Good! I promise you. But I have a condition."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fair trade, please say." Su Ge is pleased. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lance said in a positive color: "I know that you are a bottom-line, principled person. I believe that you can make a great career. If the future One day, our elf regiment is in crisis and needs your help. I hope that you can do your best to help us through the storm at that time. You can rest assured that if it involves life, you can refuse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg listened for a few seconds, then nodded, and answered with a positive face: "Yes, I, Soge Sotos, to my Lord, the Lord of Death and Storm The name swears."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening, Lance nodded with satisfaction and turned and said, "Please come with me."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then two people walked side by side into a very quiet living room on the second floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lance pulled out the purple long sword behind him, carefully placed it on the table, then knelt down, his hands whispering and whispering something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five minutes later, his hands crossed twice and pushed forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a soft blue light, a blue light appeared on Lance's forehead, which casts a quirky symbol in the air like a projector. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outside of this symbol is a circle with four wavy signs inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the rune "Lake"?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lance thought about it and explained: "Strictly speaking, it is indeed a kind of rune, but it is the supreme product derived from runes - —St. Mark Rune, referred to as Stigmata.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“St. Mark?” Su Ge also heard the vocabulary for the first time, and he was puzzled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lance explained: "The runes are the transcription of ancient gods, the lowest level, thirty-three Keynes runes represent the most basic elements of the world. On the top is a more advanced Kardin Rune, a total of eleven, respectively, mountains, sea, lake, river, rain, snow, earth, sky, forest, plain, Glen."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge nodded slightly, and he had some understanding of this knowledge before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the city of Bain, the key to cracking the Ron's statute was the one of the "river" runes engraved on the wellhead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Keynes rune symbolizes the most basic elements, while the Calder Rune symbolizes the structure of the world. The Stigmata Rune is based on Calding. On the rune, a stationery is digitized and regularized to form a powerful rune with substantial power."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"St. Mark Rune is The logo of every church, nowadays, the larger churches have their own stigma runes. For example, the Church of the Holy Blood, the holy rune that is held is the “sky.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge heard this heart mutter: "My deputy bishop is also really failing. These outsiders, one by one, know our church better than myself."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lance continues to say: "This is the holy rune that our Elf Order holds: this is the holy mark of the lake."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "The holy mark of the lake?" Su Ge is full of curiosity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lance closed the stigma and seriously warned: "You have to know that the Stigmata Rune has the highest level of binding, it is like Branded in the soul of the shackles, always bound you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge heart suddenly jumped: "What effect do you have on this holy mark? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lance smiled and said: "Don't worry too much. St. Mark is just a rune, not a notebook. The binding of the mark is very limited." Generally, only one vow can be issued. Generally, this vow is not allowed to harm the people of this church. We are the same."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then why don't you let Do you not betray the vows of the church?" Su Ge asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lance shook his head: "The so-called betrayal is too subjective, too general. You know that some paranoid world views are different from ordinary people, if one day he suddenly If the people of the Order are all enemies, then he will kill the people of the Order and will not trigger the effect of the Holy Mark."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge nodded with deep agreement. This made him immediately think of some villains in the anime. They all have their own set of values ​​that sound very arrogant and very upright. They are for the sake of all mankind, but they act without any means. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a brief narrative, the content goes to the core. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Water is the most inclusive and softest, the source of all life. Our spiritual energy is like water, constantly nourishing us. The soul, let our will grow and save. But the water will have different effects depending on the situation. The water in the sea is scary and deadly, the water in the river is surging. Only the water in the lake is the most Soft, calmest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The effect of our lake's stigma is like a lake that is so sparkling and calm, nourishing the soul And psionic. Inscribed in the spirit of the lake's holy mark, you can increase your spiritual energy by five times on a normal basis, and speed up the spiritual recovery by 30%, while making my spirit more stable and sturdy, more inclusive. Sex."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening, Su Ge was full of shock, then asked: "What are the conditions for using this holy mark?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nature is a trial through the Holy Sword." Lance said, pointing to the table. Sword on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our Elf Order serves many elves, the core of which is the Elves of the Lake. Legend has it that our Lord saved the Elves of the Lake from the devil In order to repay the favor, the spirit of the lake sacrificed the holy mark of the lake and the holy sword in the three lakes. The Holy Lord who was nourished by the holy mark and the holy sword not only survived, but also became a half-human half-elves. This sword is one of the three holy swords in the beginning, no regrets." Lance said in a positive color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge squinted: "There was no regrettable lake that you said at the pub, really exist?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lance seriously nodded: "Of course, I officially got the recognition of the holy mark because I stepped over the lake. I am qualified to use this unrepentant determination to become a holy sword."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Su Ge asked seriously: "What should I do next?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The sword is connected to the holy mark. You hold the sword. Because there is no holy mark, you will be treated as an intruder and pulled into the lake for trial. If you pass, you can get from the lake. Come out, if you don't pass, your will will be lost here forever, and then gradually dissipate and become part of the lake."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
