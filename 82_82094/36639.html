			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerez continues to explain here: "All the Yi people must abide by the principle of "I don't know who is fearless". Generally speaking, they threaten ordinary people. Not too big. But they can seduce other human beings to carry out evil rituals and criminal acts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded and said: "Understand." Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The devil is relatively simple compared to the Yi people. These are the creatures of our world. They have undergone dramatic variations due to certain problems or pedigree problems. Straight white monsters have demon spirits, werewolves, undead, and witches. Some of them can be seen normally, but most still need high enough spiritual vision, such as demon and demon, the former is the second sequence of magic, the latter is The five sequences of the magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Witches..." Su Ge wants to ask Jackos about the witch, but think about it, forget it. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no intersection between yourself and the witch, and rushing inquiries will only cause bad doubts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You seem to think about something again." Gerlos's insight made Su Ge fearful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge called the memory of Suger Sotos about the witch and whispered: "I have seen the execution of the witch, I feel them and the horror The monster is completely untouched."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerousus said nothing: "Where everything can't look at the surface, the witch is a potential bomb for people, destroying the threat." The budding stage is one of the church's main missions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded: "You continue."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "The last is a monster, the monster is better to understand. Monsters and vision are not related, most of them are descendants of some ancient creatures, or ancient creatures. including giants, dragons, Yalong, Griffin, Two-headed wildebeest and so on. But most of these things have become extinct, or they have rarely come out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to these, Su Ge’s framework for the overall worldview A deeper understanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Today, when you say this, you are tired, you can go home and take a break in advance." Gerlos was not as strict as his expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge nodded and prepared to bid farewell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, you have time to take a look at some of the church's classics and scriptures, which is very helpful for your super soul." Gerlos added. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you!" Su Ge said, bid farewell to the police station. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I got home, Sug took off his clothes and lay on the bed, watching the ceiling turn a little, and the second squatted at the bed and looked at the owner’s look, with a trace care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing, just take a break." Su Ge snorted his forehead and said softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The feeling that this psionic ability to try too much is really terrible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the time, Su Ge didn't even bother to think about it, and everything was empty and the rest of the spirit was calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At dusk, when Winnie came back, she saw her brother’s pale face coming out of the bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My God, what's wrong with you, Su Ge?" The bags were not put down, and Winnie rushed to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge put his hand in his hand and said, "Nothing, I went to the crime scene today, and some did not adapt."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wenny's temptation asks: "What about the fragrant fruit park?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know?" Su Ge stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winnie nodded and said, "Elisa passed by and heard that the person died is scary."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, it’s scary, I’ve been observing and stroking at close range, so your brother has become what it is today,” Suguez said with a sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wennie helped Su Ge sit down and did not ask the result. She put down her schoolbag and put on her clothes and said, "Then rest, I am going to prepare dinner." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a good sister!" Su Ge said with approval. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winnie smiled slightly: "This kind of praise is left to her lady! You are twenty-four today, brother! Although the current economic conditions do not allow, but you can also prepare to find one, after all, you are turning right now. After that, I have barely stepped into the middle class."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough, sister! You don't have to worry about this, you have my own plan. Su Ge hurriedly smashed the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has no time to find an object, and a lot of things need him to deal with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wennie’s smile, wearing an apron into the kitchen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night, the three brothers and sisters know each other's situation on a daily basis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Su Ge has begun to solve the case, Winnie and Black are very proud and proud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Winnie and Black are both preparing for their final exams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The period between the university and the university of the earth is very different. Once the subject is not only representative of paying a high test fee, it will also affect graduation. Overall evaluation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug did not bother, after the meal three people went back to the bedroom, doing their own study, sleeping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dream, he sat on the throne again and looked down at the empty temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is the use of these seats? Who is it for?" Su Ge looked down at the handsome and handsome seats, feeling very Waste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a rifle walking down the throne, and suddenly he felt like he was wearing something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my heart, the eyes suddenly swayed forward, and along the gate of the temple, he saw a golden figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This figure is still motionless on the ground at this time, seems to be bowing to Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
