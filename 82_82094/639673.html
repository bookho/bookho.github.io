			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the night, there is a lonely, unmanned path in the woods outside the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A middle-aged man in a black suit with a dark skin is walking on a small road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dusty leather shoes stepped on the dead branches on the road, making a very harsh sound in the quiet night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗷呜呜呜! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the distance, the faint wandering came and cast a deep and horrible atmosphere on this deep jungle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged person seems to feel something at this time. He looks up in a certain direction and opens his mouth to reveal a white and neat tooth with a hearty smile. Say: "It’s finally catching up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the middle-aged man spoke, there was a faint horror in the dark woods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like countless souls crying, like countless devils are screaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calling...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cold chilly wind blows in, the invisible force plunders Everything around, even the wet ground, turned into yellow sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have forty points at this time, you can clearly see that this squally wind is full of countless horrible souls, they are deliberately destroying everything, devour everything Life, let all things fall to death, and become the same existence as themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is resentment, this is a curse! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, this smog can't have any effect on the dark middle-aged people, even the wind can't blow the middle-aged people's clothes and hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An invisible existence seems to feel the extraordinary of this middle-aged man, and countless horrible ghosts quickly gather. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last winds gathered together to form a tall, young man with short white hair and a cold face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The youth wore a very ordinary country cloth, and the clean two-legged parts flashed from time to time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even his face seems to be constantly changing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, no matter how his face changes, the coldness and resentment will never linger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are you?" Young people were born first, and their voices were hoarse and ugly. It seemed that hundreds of people were talking at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged person seems to like to show his proud white teeth, and said: "I am! It should be regarded as a teacher, I like to put some Interesting things and knowledge are told to those who are struggling."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man raised his hand, and for a moment, countless mourning souls accompanied the sand to the middle-aged package. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man still has a hearty smile: "In your current situation, you can't achieve your goal. Even when you enter the city of Hui Yao It will touch the mysterious alarm of the city, and those who are religious will instantly destroy you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am strong! Stronger than I was before!" The tone is full of high, just like an emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man raised his hand after listening, and the palm of his hand hooked his finger slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The space in which two people live is like alive, suddenly squirming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, the sand and the ghosts are instantly smouldering, seemingly completely crushed and swallowed by what is indescribable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is, the so-called powerful?" The middle-aged man smiled at this time and asked faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man is wide-eyed at this time, full of the traces of the years, staring at the middle-aged: "Who are you?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man put his hands behind him: "A teacher only."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The times have changed, nowadays The world is completely different from your third dynasty. With your reckless behavior, you will die very quickly. This time is not a seal, it is a real death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The look on the face of the youth is constantly changing. He asks, "What are you doing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You want to follow the yellow seal to find what you desire, and It's not difficult, I am standing here now, just want to help you. So that you can better integrate into the world and better find your own goals." The voice of middle-aged people is so refreshing, the tone is so Sincerity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You don’t believe in youth: "Why are you helping me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am against you The goal is more interesting. Directly, I teach you knowledge, then you help me to get rid of the goal." The middle-aged man said his purpose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The youth was deeply meditation after listening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man did not speak, his hands behind him, looked up at the three rounds of the moon in the sky, with a smile and affection on his face, seemingly watching three Beautiful beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time does not know how long it has passed, the youth begins to answer: "What is your name, human."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp This question seems to have asked middle-aged people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man brows slightly and meditates for a long time and says: "You can call me Black Pharaoh."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Black Pharaoh?" Young people are somewhat unhappy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the word Pharaoh was in the period of the Calding Empire, the emperor’s title in theocracy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When young people think the name is very rude, middle-aged people add: "And, I am not human."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This young man who seems to have thought of something, responded: "Okay, Black Pharaoh."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have Name?" asked the black pharaoh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Youth answered: "No."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Pharaoh’s hearty smile: "Then you call Naia Latotip, so your goal will be to find you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, Sug got up and rubbed his eyes and found that the eyes that were crying were red and swollen and looked awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shelly looked at Su Ge’s look and couldn’t help but smile: “You look pretty cute now.”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug is speechless, put on his clothes, but picks up something from his pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge reached out and picked up the round thing, which was the yellow seal that was sealed by Su Ge with the cold flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you do with this thing?" Xuelier asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge will still be on the side and say, "Let's put it, anyway, it's a waste now, I have time to deal with it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where are you going today?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are a lot of things today, I have to go see the West first. Father Nie, talk about cooperation, then go to the clinic that Emilia told me to see what kind of person is being imprisoned by the Stars and the Blood Maze."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about the heritage?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge silenced, reached for the dilapidated key, and calmly answered: "I will handle it at the right time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After breakfast, Su Ge went out of their homes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just out of the door, just to see Albert rushing towards this side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong?" Seeing that Albert came to himself, Su Ge had some surprises. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert whispered: "Two things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The first one, Your existence is now completely exposed, and the entire church is using the greatest strength to get you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
