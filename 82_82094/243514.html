			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After bidding farewell to Ivan, Su Ge and Roland and Evan said a conversation and left the mysterious workshop to return to their home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The place where he lives today is still his own home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main area where the giant worms are ravaged is the city center, and the buildings on the outskirts are spared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sitting on the sofa, Su Ge looked at the empty living room a bit lonely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Ada smiled and prepared food, while talking about his daily experience, and then he still touched Su Ge’s head to educate him. One heart is good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A good and understanding big sister suddenly became a strange existence disappearing from the front of Su Ge, this huge contrast makes him now stunned Huai. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Forget it, don't think about it. I hope that when I meet next time, it is not an enemy." Su Ge sighed and sighed a few times. The dog's head turned and got up to prepare for cooking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Put the coal into the iron stove, and Su Ge will cook the noodles on the pot rack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gas pipeline in the city has been completely scrapped, and the gas supply system of the entire city is completely paralyzed. Nowadays, when cooking at home, only the coal that is sent by the church can be burned, or It is a firewood that has been shipped from the countryside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s okay, it’s not winter now, or the days are sad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After lunch, Su Ge sat down to continue reading, and now the book he reads is not a occult thing, but a self-cultivation of the superior. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The author of the book was the third dynasty of the Third Dynasties, the 12th Emperor of the Kardin Empire, known as the Emperor of the Emperor, Karlding XI. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor was only a throne when he was sixty years old, and he was the chief professor of Imperial College before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He spent most of his life in teaching, so he has a very strong summarizing and educational ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After his abdication at the age of ninety-eight, he wrote this book, which was regarded as a gem by countless emperors and organizational leaders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge was very hurt after Luke denied his status as a Pope last time, and also reflected on some of his behavior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finds that he really lacks an imposing manner and a gas field, and even lacks the tone and temperament of the superiors when he acts as a god in his dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you don't have the body to help me hold the scene, let me go to the body, it is estimated that the stuffing has already begun." Su Ge opened the book and sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the future, after the church develops, I will definitely give some speeches as a pope. At that time, there is no body of the Pope to let me use. It’s important to pay attention now, and it’s definitely useful to learn some.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the afternoon, spend the quiet study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night, Su Ge, who had not taken a shower because of water cuts, slept directly after meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first time Su Ge has entered a dream after his arrival. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days ago, I was busy with the emergency reconstruction after the disaster, and I didn’t have the energy to go to the boat to continue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sitting on the throne, Su Ge first sorted out the whole thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Through this brief entry into the physical world, there are many previous doubts that have been made clear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; "First of all, the conditions for the fleet to enter the material world are very harsh. The core conditions are that a large-scale war must break out or a large-scale human collective death can come."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is in line with the Nordic mythology on Earth. The rumored hunter army is a natural phenomenon that only occurs in areas where war is frequent. They are accompanied by cold winds and storms. The air whizzed past and took away all the souls of human beings who died. Some of them are similar to the ancient Chinese squad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Su Ge’s eyes fall In the gun on his own hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to a version of the rumor, the prototype of the hunter is the dark side of the Nordic god Odin. Then according to the nature of the rifle possessing storm and thunder, it should be Oden's weapon Gungner. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although I have figured out some things, more mysteries have emerged. How can the hunter hunting on the earth appear in this world, the gods of the world? How could it fall into this mad hunting posture, and what happened before, the battleship was defeated to such a degree, and finally..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge I started to look at the dome of the temple: "What the big clock is going on."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation is like a circle, when you will be inside the circle After everything is known, after expanding, it is found that the enlarged circle will be exposed to more completely unknown things and mysteries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't think about it in this area. After getting more information, let's study it again!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This time the appearance not only declared my existence on a small scale, but also greatly attracted the attention of the church. They will attach great importance to it and set up a full-time staff to conduct in-depth investigations. I can't find anything in the middle of the meeting. But this time I did get a lot of important messages."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am linked to the world. Now I feel carefully, when I was in the world, I had hundreds of imaginary lines linking with me. These lines should represent the spells or ways that can be summoned in this world to summon me. The most direct proof is one of the dotted lines. It has become a solid line, connecting Hills and Bernice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This means that there are others who may call me again. Well, this should be noted."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;"In addition, this time I went out to consolidate my connection with the material world. Now I have thought about how to let the people make normal sacrifices and offerings to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole body is completely passive, and Su Ge’s subjective will is unable to find too much in-depth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The god is like a person who has lost his memory, but his instinct is still only after encountering some conditions or things that are similar to touching the situation. You can get some relevant knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
