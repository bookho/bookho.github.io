			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the morning, Bernice got up early, took a shower first, and then combed her long purple hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put on the white stockings, tighten your waist and pick the most popular dark blue Gothic dress in this year's capital, look at the mature in the mirror The distinguished beautiful lady, nodded with satisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slightly apply light makeup, put on a light gold shawl, wear a mesh hat on the lace side, black gloves, make sure that the overall dress is not uncomfortable, squatting The skirt is out of the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light blue wagon at the door is ready, the groom in the coat opens his door with a smile: "Beautiful lady, please!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you!" Bernice smiled brightly, laughing at the inside of the horse, full of spring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage then went to the Tokachi Gate along the wide and clean streets in the hooves of the horseshoe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tensures Gate is the most prosperous and famous place in the entire Belindi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name derives from the famous king of the early days of the establishment of the Empire: Sarurus the Great. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rumored that the great war of Sarruth had little defeat in the battle, and he repeatedly went to the Lien Chan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most famous one is to lead the human army wars abyss monsters, from the last position of mankind to the abyss cloud valley, all the way ten wins and ten wins, killing the abyss monster And the aliens are frightened and lose their armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the battle, Sarurus the Great, famous in the world, was firmly imprinted in the history of mankind, has been admired by countless young people, ten wins The door is therefore named. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the establishment of the Tokachi Gate, here is the famous tourist attraction of the Belland Empire, which symbolizes the peak of the Belland Empire, which represents the Berlan The most proud backbone of the Germans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ten Victory Gate is huge, and you can see the huge gate from afar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It looks at least 70 meters high and 30 meters wide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire door is engraved with fine patterns and reliefs, including countless monsters, enemies of the land, flags flying, and the center of the threshold. A tall man riding a horse and holding an axe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten wins gate is a door, but also an area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This area is connected to the Royal Palace in the east, the Holy See Church in the south, and the Imperial Business Center in the north. It is one of the fires of the entire Imperial City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who live here not only have a lot of money, but also a big family that has been passed down for hundreds of years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most critical point is that the big family who are qualified to live here are the heroes of the family who have great warfare achievements and the generals of the generals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you can see that the huge ten-seat door has only a dozen large and luxurious mansions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Grasse family is one of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Skip the tall dark red wall to see the quiet path inside, the green grass, the delicate flowers, and the beautifully trimmed green plants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray-black giant castle is located in the middle of this worldlike fairyland. The large houses are at least one hundred meters long and occupy a large area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The overall style of the house tends to be British Gothic. The overall style is tall and thin, the walls are thick and strong, the top spires are towering, and the bottom pointed arches are lined with In the middle of the pattern wall is a large window with a thin, stained glass. The overall look is light and slender, and has a unique sense of flying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage stopped in front of the large iron gate in front of the courtyard. A maid wearing a blue shirt and a white dress at the door had already waited here, saying: Miss Ross, please!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;British nodded with a smile and followed the maid from the side door into the manor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bennis!" Seeing Bernice coming over, a woman in a luxurious cotton-white blouse and pink silk dress walked happily. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss! Slow down! Slow down! Etiquette! Etiquette!" The older maid on the side hurriedly reminded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman listened to the playful spit and spit out her tongue, not thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman looks like she is in her early twenties, her skin is fair, her face is oval, she has a blond hair and eyebrows, and her face has a few freckles, but it has no effect. Her beauty has made her youthful and energetic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a good friend of Bernice, Tracy Grasse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two good sisters are very close to each other, and Tsui’s mysterious secret says: “Come on! Come on! My brother gave me back yesterday. Things, come and see!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, holding the hand of Bernice, he walked toward the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bennis followed her a few steps forward and asked: "Cui Xi, is your father here?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cui Xi nodded: "Well, I am reading in the study room now, what happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benice whispered: "You know, My brother is a very powerful mystery."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm!" Hearing Bernice’s brother, Tracy nodded and his eyes flickered. Aspire to the excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Bernice, Bernice’s brother is a very powerful mystery, almost omnipotent, very powerful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Auntie! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge, who was doing morning exercises, suddenly sneezed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who is chanting me?" Sug licked his nose and continued to punch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A few days ago, you and I said that the Marquis trophy was stolen. I told him about this when I was in contact with my brother. What do you guess? "British tells the story is very good at hanging people's appetite." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this is very appropriate, not only does not cause resentment, but also listens to the sense of expectation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's wrong? What's wrong?" Tracy glared at her own big eyes and asked twice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;British whispered in her ear: "My brother has news of blood sacrifices. After he heard that you and I are good sisters, Immediately tell me this news, let me tell the Marquis today!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really!?" Trishington looked amazed and excited, like a Cheerful Lark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benedict said seriously: "Of course, how can this lie!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s great! Let’s go! I will take you to see my father!” Tracy immediately took Bones and ran to the Admiral’s study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss! The master is reading!" The nanny behind the hurriedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cui Xi and Bernice are wearing flat shoes, running fast, while running and saying: "We have important information, will not bother my father reading !"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the corridor, in a room on the third floor , Tracy knocked on the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come in, Tracy." Inside the door, there was a hint of helplessness in the calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cui Xi shrunk his neck and carefully plunged his head into it: "Father, how do you know that it is me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the dark red solid wood desk, I am doing a middle-aged man with a tall, healthy, hairy and bearded white face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He seems to be in his early fifties, sitting there like a tiger, giving a sense of oppression that is not angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a thick eyebrow, his eyes are stunned, and Kong Wu is powerful, full of strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the greatest naval ambassador of the Empire for nearly three hundred years: Green Glass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of the country-like word like a knife shows a trace of love: "Continuous knocking on the door five times, the big home will also use this rude knock on the door."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Cui Xi spit out his tongue and took Bernice into it and said, "Father! Father! I made a merit!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? What kind of work? My lovely little Tsui West?" Green put down the book, kindly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cui Xi will immediately say it again, Green’s thick eyebrows are slightly picked up, his eyes are on Bernice’s body, and the dark green eyes are slightly Chill, then softly said: "Little Cui Xi, you go out first, I have something to talk to your friend."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tricyon is not happy Mouth: "Why are you carrying Tracy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green smiled and said: "Some things you are not suitable for now, but the father will tell you later. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cui Xi snorted, although he looked very savvy, but he turned and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the departure of Cui Xi, Green’s eyes stared at Bernice indifferently, and a burst of horror was released: “You have been close to Cui Xi for so long, finally Showing the real purpose, the witch."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing his identity was dismantled, Bernice still calmed down and said with a smile: "Thanks to the Marquis After my identity, I did not report it to the Holy See."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!" Green snorted: "I hate people who like to be smart, my information is The mysterious world is not expensive. Tracy is pure, and there are countless people who have hoped to contact me through her for many years, but these people are finally gone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No The word is very ambiguous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the ambiguity that makes people feel a chill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benice is still calm at this time: "Do not misunderstand the Marquis, I am not smart. I did investigate you, but this is after I know Tsui. I can swear by my faith that when I first met Tsui Xi, I didn’t have any utilitarian inside."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
