			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;April 15th, light rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, one of my other companions died under the wicked cult. We sent his body back to the church from outside the city in a sad mood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can feel the sadness and depression of everyone on the road. This is the second cult event of the month. Two things we lost three brave companions . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought this was a very common task, but when I didn’t think of it, his body suddenly mutated when passing through the cemetery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time we heard a small squeak, like the strange sound of a dangerous snake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After our gaze, his body was distorted, and a monster full of blood and horror appeared from his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has a snake-like body, and its ugly head is covered with filthy eyes. It just makes people sick, we%...¥## ¥<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter part is covered by cluttered ink and cannot be seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the 30th diary. The diary of the night watchman is not written every day. It will only be recorded when something is worth remembering. The process is neatly written, and it seems that in this way to vent their inner fear, eager to seal this strange thing in this diary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why didn't you record the name of the dead companion, but use him instead?" Shelly was a bit uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a fan of fiction, this third-person general refers to her reading is very uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge flipped through the pages he had read before: "It should be to protect the secrets. After all, the names of many clergymen cannot be known to ordinary people." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge turned over a page and saw the follow-up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to the investigation by the Archbishop, it was said that his body was cursed by the cultists before such a terrible variation. This made us very convinced at the time, but then I always felt that something was wrong. Because his death was pierced by people. The heart, using blood medicine to kill, did not suffer any mysterious attack."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continue to look down, the next time has been from a certain April of the year came to June 23rd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today my captain, who sacrificed himself to stop the cultist's ritual, also sacrificed three players. I and %¥# are the cowards who survived only two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We stepped on the friend, the body of the companion sealed the ghost baby and completed the task. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I have become the captain of the night watchman, but I am not happy at all, and even feel that my heart is going to collapse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being into mystery, there is no turning back, only gradually being swallowed up by the abyss. I know the weight of this sentence clearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My vision has been forty-seven, and I can see a lot of hidden existence that I could not see before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I...I’m beginning to doubt whether my beliefs are firm and doubt whether my heart is pure.........<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;September 6th, sunny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have experienced a deeper level of embarrassment and burden. Today I have witnessed a cheerful and lively child who has just joined the night watcher for less than three months. Cruelly killing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment I saw his body, I felt like I was going crazy, crazy and anger destroyed my reason, and at that moment, I felt free. I feel that my spirit has been extended infinitely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This infinite extension makes me feel fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I returned to God, I have killed all the cultists, and other clergymen looked at me with fear at this time, just like a monster In general, I was not afraid at the time, except for sadness, only deep exhaustion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;October 20, early snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My squadron team was re-established and received the first emergency mission to support the gods in the north of the city. They were deeply immersed in the cult ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we arrived, I witnessed the most horrible thing in my life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gods who are pious and pure in their hearts have turned into horrible monsters at this time. They are covered with red hair and no hair. Reason, kill all the active monsters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were forced to annihilate them all with other clergy. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later, the Archbishop came in person, and he said that these sacred priests were tempted by the filthy son, deviated from their faith and devoted themselves to the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These clerics were labeled as unsettled, false believers, which made me feel very sad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge turned a page, and the second page was a short sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard some news afterwards, there is no cult ritual there, there seems to be the experiment of the latest blood remedies%#......¥ ......¥#<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After half of the words, the content afterwards was completely smeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;January 7, heavy snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When people are still immersed in the peace after the Lunar New Year, I am deeply lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the execution of the task yesterday, my team members were seriously injured and accepted the church blood treatment, and were actually notified that they had passed away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes me unacceptable. I know blood therapy very well. As long as the clerics who are sent to the Church of the Holy Blood are not dead, I have seen one. The body of the clergyman was cut off from the waist and recovered completely in a week after receiving treatment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I quietly conducted an investigation, according to a scared nurse, at that time she heard a non-human scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
