			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;March calendar May 15, 7847. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s been a year and a half since the time of the ancient city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tragedy that shocked half of the mysterious world was also officially notified by the church in March, and it gradually subsided after about a month of boiling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The March official report of the church said that it was an ancient racial attempt to hold a ritual to summon evil spirits, countless mysterious people were brutally killed, and the last March church together with the entire church The Alliance, spent a lot of hard work, finally wiped out the evil spirit that had been summoned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the church union suffered heavy losses due to the fierce fighting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The biggest loss is the sacrifice of the legendary bishop Suger Sotos and the master killer Sapir Andre. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard the news, I was shocked by the world, and then sighed for the sacrifice of the two geniuses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nell in the city of Bain was very dissatisfied with the news and could not accept that the nasty traitor of Su Ge actually died in the manner of a church hero. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just after his protest, he was the most severely warned and suppressed in his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the Deputy Pope wrote a letter personally, so that he could never mention the name Sog Sotos in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This moment, Nell, who is still in the dark, made a big jump, but he was obedient and obsessed with the name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of friends of Su Ge was very surprised to hear this, and then grieves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But very quickly, they suddenly thought of what Su Ge had said to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Trust me, don't worry or sorrow anyway, if you hear anything about me, because it must be fake!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After these people secretly visited Guinness, they gradually settled down and continued their work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, the three Pope’s shots at the same time are indeed extraordinary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole message was strictly blocked, and it was clear that hundreds of outsiders knew about it, but everyone did nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless intelligence organizations in the dark to find out, but did not find any insider, just like this is like the official notification, there is nothing to dig deep into and scrutinize . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four major colleges, the elves, the fortress, all the mouth-to-mouth, even the relevant personnel at the time were re-adjusted, and all signed The contract written by the barrister at the level of the person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything is so calm and has become a thing of the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that one and a half years have passed, that matter has only become a few lines on the document. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As far as the truth is concerned, no one has paid attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The western part of the western continent, the ancient deep forest in the lion empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ancient deep forest, just heard these four words, you know that this forest will be very long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also like the name, this is a primitive deep forest that has never been developed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the local records, there is an ancient emperor’s grave in this deep forest, dating back to the second dynasty of 9000 years ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rumor that this emperor used to be a famous tyrant in history, was resentful after being cursed by a mysterious person, killing many innocent people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After being tortured by the church in March, he has experienced countless curses and spurns, and accumulated an indescribable curse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost all the people who entered did not come out, and over time, they became a fierce place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this, this large forest is very well preserved, with a lot of straight trees, including larch, scotch pine, red spruce, White birch, aspen, etc., and there is a very complete system of wild animals inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even some people have seen the Golden Retriever that has been extinct for many years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, this piece of primitive wood has welcomed two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the depths of the jungle, there is a temple in the middle of the two mountains that is completely abandoned and collapsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temple should be destroyed in the landslides, the ruined ruins, and the big stones everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the time is too long, the stone has been a lot of vegetation, full of moss, even wild mushrooms and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the ruins stood a man and a woman at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two mountaineering bags behind them, wearing canvas visors on their heads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man is wearing a brown jacket and his lower body is tight leg pants and hiking boots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman is similar, but the jacket is tied around the waist, the light blue plaid shirt pulls up the sleeves, revealing the white flower arm, making people look dazzled . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it here?" The man looked down at the map in his hand and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman came over and looked down: "It’s almost like this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Untied the kettle and took a sip of water, rubbed the scarlet lips, and said with unbelief: "Are you sure there is a clue here? If you let me run, you have a good look."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man snorted: "If you don't believe me, then don't follow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, the man stood up and said: "And who can make it look good, maybe you said the last time, the final result is that you are very clear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The woman bit her teeth after listening to it, and she will throw the kettle over her hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; just raised his hand and found that this seems to be the last pot of water, with a hint of sinister voice: "Sug, you better not be proud, wait for me." The strength of the day is restored, see how I can clean you up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man smiled and did not speak to continue to look at the map. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This pair of men and women is naturally Su Ge and Sherry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past year and a half, the two people are together every day, according to Su Ge’s plan, to start the world tour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long time to get along with each other, so that Su Ge has already figured out the details and habits of this vicious woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She did, as he had guessed before, guilty of hand venom and murder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has seen it many times in the past year and a half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he is also very clear that today's Shirley has a great dependence on himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only economically and safely, but also physically and mentally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once upon a time, two people were prepared to separate for one night for some reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result, Sherry was directly in a state of violent, not only burned the team, but even almost killed dozens of the team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, Sug had forgotten something and stopped her when she came back to pick it up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After losing money and apologizing, it’s all Su Ge’s business. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley even said how fierce and vicious things are, for Su Ge, just to talk about it, definitely not to do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the relationship between two people is complex and complicated until two people can't tell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it a boyfriend or a girl? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, two people have only passion for each other and no love. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Man and wife? That is even more impossible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Friends? Not counting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you use Su Ge’s words to describe it, the two people are the only pao friends who are bound to each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl is not obsessed with any man other than him, but is obsessed with physical desires. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Su Ge is very obsessed with her because of Ada’s reason, just like a toy that never plays tired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Maple Leaf City, two people lived for seven days while making plans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These days, Shirley’s request for Su Ge is terrible, and the two have barely been out of the hotel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, Su Ge has already obtained the scriptures from Gerlos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After experiencing the beginning of the strangeness and embarrassment, Su Ge was almost squeezed out and became more comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The technique taught by Gerlos was very useful, saving a lot of physical strength on the third day. After the <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, Su Ge also bought some special props according to the teachings of Gerlos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As time goes by and the depth of the technique, Su Ge unlocks a lot of new poses on Shelly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When seven days later, Vanas gave two people ready to go on the road, Su Ge finally reluctantly surrendered this ghost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the road, Su Ge’s plan is simple, that is, to find more clues about the gods, as well as other era ruins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first stop of the two men was the abyss that claimed to be the battlefield of the ancient gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the edge of the abyss for about two weeks, in addition to hearing some legends and legends, also received the warm hospitality of Andrew and the Wolf Legion, after which two people left Go to the next stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What shocked Su Ge was that even Andrew was "banned" by the March church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second stop is a lost island in the southern archipelago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When two people arrived, they found that the so-called lost island was actually one of the forbidden places of the Elf Order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because ordinary people can't get in, they are gradually called the lost island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge, who has the sacred mark of the lake, naturally received the highest standard of reception from the Elves. Afterwards, Su Ge even went to the Holy Land to meet the fairy in the lake, and finally continued on the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third stop is a joke before Su Ge: Golden City, a group of robbers and widowers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there, Su Ge really felt what a real bandit and coward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just entering the city, dozens of men do not say anything, rushed over and said foul words, they must steal Shirley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as a result, Su Ge directly killed sixty people in a row, killing all the cowards on that street, and buying under the watchful gaze of the vendors. Some food and water left the city, leaving a legend of a "golden butcher." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After this incident, Shirley’s view of Su Ge seems to have changed a lot. It seems that he recognizes Su Ge and speaks a lot softer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afterwards, two people are running around the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The desert rushed through the jungle, wandering through the sea, drifting over the sea, going over snow-capped mountains, going through caves, killing bandits, grabbing treasures, and even following the tombs. The thief steals the treasure to find treasure, and incarnates the treasure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
