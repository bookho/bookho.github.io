			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people in the Holy Blood Library saw through the window just the moment, everyone was dumbfounded, Father Anthony and Mother Marlene were simply stunned and unable to sit on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because... built a century-old Cathedral of the Holy Blood, it’s gone for a moment...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;This is their faith, their pillars, their...the destination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father Hank’s hand holding the window sill trembled, and the body finally leaned against the wall, closing his eyes and crying silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are not sad now, even the Holy Blood Library can not withstand the second level of attack, quickly away from this place." Rogan The weak voice suddenly remembered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hour ago, those people gave up the guards for Rogan, but went somewhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogan resumed using his own special method, struggling to get out of there and flee to the Library of St. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with him, there are ten mad men who are locked by a large number of chains at this time, dressed in broken prisoners. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clergyman listened, and looked at Rogan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr., trouble you." Rogan turned to look at the wheelchair man, Father Water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French nodded slightly and walked to the side of the gate, and pressed a few places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After then, everyone felt the library swaying, and it flew like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, you can see that the huge, oddly shaped library slowly floats from the ground and flies toward the city in a strange way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the ground, the two sides of the battle have stopped separating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clawson looked at the huge monster that was extremely distorted and whispered: "This is not a real god, it seems to be just a corner of the gods or Son."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the power has been able to compete with me." Luke's face has never been dignified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After all, there is an extraterritorial presence from the astral world, this power has not been at a level with us." Clausen sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not far from Adeline and other four women and the coming Marx and Bobby gathered together, his face looked very dignified and black twisted presence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is not a real god, and because of the collapse of this rule, we have not even grown up." Bernice seriously analyzed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vignia said at this time, "This disgusting thing is very scary. We are not opponents at all. Let’s get out of here, the city has already There is no hope."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hills clenched his fists, his eyes sparkling and said: "No hope? Don't be so ignorant, this city is my The city sheltered by the Lord, this group of ants and filth will die very badly, believe me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dark ruins, Ron carries a The believers were kneeling at the feet of this disgusting monster. Their faces were full of fanaticism and excitement. They yelled and said: "The great Mori black goat, please break this illusory and false world and give us infinite knowledge. And see through the world's truth! We will give you everything you need!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time a piece of black mud has become a full Hundreds of meters high, with three huge hooves, the whole body is composed of countless tentacles and mouths. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This monster stretches out dozens of tiny tentacles and slowly touches Ron’s foreheads. It seems to feel their thoughts, and the two tentacles of the body suddenly The first wave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two horrible tentacles of the moment are like infinitely long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One is entangled in the Library of St., and the other is attacked by Adeline. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the scope, even including the friendly forces such as Clausen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This group of madmen!" The speed of the tentacles is not fast, but it is too large and long, so they have lost all the space to dodge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's over!" Adelin suddenly looked pale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the weaker Hills and others did not feel anything, and even launched an attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few of the cold-shoulder churches in the station who did not dodge and disappeared directly by the tentacles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the next second is not flying out, but is caught by the tentacle of the tentacle, and is eaten by the countless big mouths above. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eat a few mysterious people, and paused for a moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this moment, Luke rushed over and took the crowd back quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also Clausen, who is actually pulling Hills and Vegniya to help them retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't be nervous, I think that although we are enemies, we still have to cooperate temporarily in the face of life outside this field."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the speed of two people does not have to be fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few seconds, the tentacle like a building circled in a circle, and when they caught up, they surrounded them in the middle...<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air, the terror of the tentacles will completely entangle the library of the Holy Blood in the air, while still tightening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horrible mass of the mouth is madly eating the wall of the Library of the Holy Blood. It seems that all the existence of this world is its food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the library, everyone’s face is very pale, listening to the squeaky squeaky wall, the body shivering, and even many people are directly Scared and fainted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the ground, at the same time as the attack, countless tentacles quickly spread out and directly caught hundreds of surviving nearby citizens. They were so devastating that they would eat them alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After eating humans, a series of black small monsters appeared under its huge body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These monsters are similar to it. Although the size is small, the speed of growth is incredible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It takes less than ten seconds to be born to grow to five meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the ground, everyone, including Luke and Clausen, opened his eyes and madly attacked the close tentacle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, this tentacle is like being at a level with them, all their attacks, physical, spiritual, and mysterious are invalid, as if they were hit The same as the illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the distance, once again hundreds of people were swallowed up by this huge monster, and then more small monsters were born and began to wreak havoc in the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Ron and others are very excited to ride on these small monsters, and start to madly destroy the city, the distorted joy and excitement on the face Heart cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, Bain, it's over!" Roland, Hank, and other clergymen squatted on the ground, waiting for the library to break. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Luke, Aideline and others surrounded by tentacles were pale, desperately looking at the close tentacles, unable to attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't expect that I ended up in the hands of these outsiders." Luke sighed helplessly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clawson said with a sigh of relief: "I hope it will really end my life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Are we going to die?" Bobby whispered to Marx's hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marx smiled: "Just less we die together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
