			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time that Su Ge was full of people, the Marquis of Grasse Manor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third floor study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iyta is sitting in a chair with courtesy and courtesy, legs are put together, the waist is sitting straight, respectful, showing full respect and courtesy. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pigu did not sit next to her because there is no Pigu location. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green sitting behind the desk is like a tiger lying all the time, looking at the books in his face, not looking at Iyer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iyeta respectfully said: "We can give the Marquis adults far more than the market price."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Today, she came here on behalf of the Fuguo female warlock to discuss the delivery of supplies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green looked down at the book and said casually: "All said that your female warlocks have a wide range of experience and wisdom. How do I think that you are just a group that only knows to do What about the madman in daydreaming?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard that, Ieta looked pale and whispered, "You already know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green did not speak, still reading. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iyeta’s fists were a little trembling, and the temptation asked: “We are not malicious to you, nor are we malicious to the royal family. If we can build a country, It has great benefits for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green's plain question: "Do you think I am targeting you? You still have no qualifications."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iyeta oozes two drops of sweat on his forehead and does not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green closed the book at this time, and for the first time looked up to Yieta, and said with a sarcasm in his mouth: "You still don't understand the problem." ?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iyeta stood up and bowed: "Also ask the legendary general to enlighten me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Green leaned on the chair and said casually: "The reason for not helping you is very simple. It has nothing to do with the interests. It is just that your stupid leader has offended someone who should not be offended."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;! ! ! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, Ieta was struck by lightning, and when I was pale, my mind instantly figured out everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The legendary general is still the mysterious and powerful friend!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green looks Her appearance, faintly said: "Moggs, drop off."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the middle, Iyeta and Pigu were sent out of the manor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's the matter?" Pigu asked seriously, his heart was full of impatience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked out, after the incident, the woman was frightened and completely lost the courage to do big things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A woman is a woman after all. If she can't do this, it will only let me go out." At this moment, Pigu's self is full of confidence. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important thing is that the adult who is not as strong as Iyeta is not known how many times he has been favored by him, secretly orders him if there is a problem with Yeta. Can replace her at any time, and let the younger and more beautiful, more powerful female warlock to assist him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine the exquisite and beautiful female warlocks I saw before, and he was more annoyed with the old woman in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yiyata At this time all the attention was attracted by the horrible energy of Su Ge, and did not pay attention to the problem of Pigu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time she returned to God and said calmly: "Failed, go back first, I need to be quiet."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, left alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pigu saw this, his mouth smiled and smiled, turned and took the carriage and left quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking on the street, the spirit of Iyeta is awkward, and the mysterious existence is now showing too much power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can actually be on an equal footing with the legendary general, and even let the legendary general give up such a big benefit to others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun is slowly rising, and the people on the street are gradually getting less and it seems that they are enjoying lunch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, she felt a special mysterious wave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of volatility is very weird, as if it existed before the normal mysterious wave system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she can feel that it is indeed mysteriously fluctuating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there a mystery who is doing things?" Ieta hesitated, still decided to look at the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mysterious volatility flashed past, but she has excellent skills for psionic fluctuations and detection due to her special abilities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the way she just felt, she crossed a street and came to the alley next to a bar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be careful, she smelled a special smell in her nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the taste of sulfur. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what does sulfur mean? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nature is a demon! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Devil!?" Iyeta immediately showed himself a stealth technique that he was most proud of, and a cloaking technique. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Worriedly leaning against the corner of the wall, the probe looked at it, and Yetaton’s eyes widened and his expression was full of horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the edge of the rubbish, the two young faces were lying pale on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time their bodies are already festering, and the source of the ulcer is their lower body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of both of them, there is a tall and sexy monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has lavender skin, double horns on her head, wings on her back, sheep's hooves on her feet, full of cavities, naked, and beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The charm of the devil!" Iyeta saw this look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil is a high-level demon, with a strong camouflage ability, can become a human beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The men who meet with them will be eroded by the power of the horrible demon after the cross, and they will die so badly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This method of killing people is the favorite way to charm the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This demon can only exist in the abyss, how can it be here!?" Ieta thought with horror, sweeping around her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then she saw a bard, a ponytail, and a young man walking around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you feel when you look at your own life?" The youth made a sound of peace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呜呜呜..." Seeing the youth, the man on the ground struggled, but he couldn’t move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man nodded with satisfaction: "This kind of death is very worthy of the innocent girls who are harmed by you."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speak, just wave. The charm of the devil disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Ieta was even more shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only seeing the youth and waving a hand, suddenly two dark hands appeared in the air directly caught the two youths. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Summerly enjoy your journey to hell." After the youth finished, the two youths disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing such a terrible means, Iyta suddenly trembled and the vision rose directly by two points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
