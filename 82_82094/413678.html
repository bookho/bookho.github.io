			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sitting on the bed, Sug gasping and feeling dizzy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slightly turning to look at the shadow of the moon behind the thick dark red curtains, it is impossible to tell whether this is a reality or a dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A deep breath, Su Ge calmed down, turned his head and touched the cane and gloves at the bedside, and felt a little inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The old dream of the ancient city, where is it? Where are the seven people sitting next to the campfire and the Holy Grail documents, and the Holy Grail?" Lock, the face is not very good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗷呜...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One side, I don’t know when to kneel at the bed, ice blue The colored eyes sparkle in the darkness, and the chin is lying on the edge of the bed, watching the owner with concern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge touched the head of Erha, the heavy and doubtful thoughts of the heart got some sharing, and said with a smile: "It's okay, it's just a dream." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he finished, he turned his head and looked at the place that was not far away. It was already soft on the ground and seemed to be exhausted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't have the ability to generate this kind of volatility, that is, some external stimuli let it pass something that affects me."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the Holy Grail?" Su Ge couldn't figure it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contemplation for five minutes, Sug shook his head and said: "Forget it, now I can't figure it out, wait for some clues to come back later!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, he walked out of bed with a cane and returned to the rag after returning to the growth gun: "Give me honestly!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then go back to bed and continue to sleep...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning at 7:00, Su Ge opened his eyes on time, wash, eat breakfast, and organize Hair, clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At eight o'clock, Jean came over and asked: "Bishop, what is the trip today?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take the things I gave you, to carry out your mission, I plan to walk by myself these days and go to see my former friends." Su Ge put his hat on his head and said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jean listened and nodded and said, "I will definitely live up to your expectations."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sogge Griffin checked the current position of the Evan family and left the Cathedral of the Holy Blood alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yesterday, listening to Ivan’s mention of some Evan’s situation, Su Ge seems to feel something wrong, just to see his situation through this old friend’s visit. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Avon’s home has also been demolished and moved to a brand new house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The location of their home moved from Maple Street to Yujin Street, which is a little bit closer to the city center, and belongs to the group of people who have better contrast in the relocation households. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Basilica of the Holy Blood is not too far from the location, and it takes 15 minutes to walk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time he did not bring two ha, because the rag is not stable now, he needs two ha to help him take care of it, to guarantee it There won't be any incidents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the refurbished clean and tidy street, Su Ge looked at the rushed pedestrians who had put on their hats and put on their coats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now in October, the temperature in the north of Bain City has dropped a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the look and temperament of these people, Suge clearly felt that both men and women seemed to be more assertive and confident than before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only those elites with velvet gloves, fluffy trench coats, and gold nanmu canes, those in blue overalls wearing work clothes are also full Hope, it looks full of enthusiasm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope that it is really important for people." Su Ge secretly sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is not going fast, he wants to see more about the current situation and climate in the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After crossing two blocks, Su Ge's face was not very good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because at this moment he found a human face again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time the human face rat was kneeling on a piece of bread, a milky white bug went down its spine and into the piece of bread. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this frequency too frequent?" Sug quickly walked over and prepared to solve it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vision system set by the March Goddess is to maintain the purity of the ordinary human world, so that normal humans can live without any burden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of the Yi people who climbed out of the abyss would not touch humans who could not see them, because it would have no meaning for them. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the human face is different, they are deliberately releasing brainless insects to harm humans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it controlled by someone? Or is it a special breath left by the Dark Son?" Su Ge thought, suddenly protruding the palm of his hand with black gloves to Thunder. Not as good as the ear, directly grabbed the human face mouse above. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing!?" The bakery owner on the side saw the dissatisfied big voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This cake is worth twenty cents! He doesn't want to be dirty by this guy and he doesn't want to buy it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge threw the first franc to the hand and picked up the bread and said, "This is what I want."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the money, the boss suddenly turned his face and said: "Well, this will give you a bag."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" ". Su Ge took the bread and turned and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr., haven't found your money yet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's a tip." Su Ge Feel free to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the happy laughter and compliment of the boss, Su Ge squeezed the frozen face-faced face-faced rat and threw the ice slag into the trash can. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After extending your finger, find out the brainless insects in the cake and pinch it to death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cake was thrown away, and Su Ge’s mood was a bit heavy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what he happened to see today, and those who he can’t see don’t know how much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there anyone planning to break the system of the goddess of March?" Su Ge thought suddenly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has come to Evan’s new home, 3904, Yujin Street . A new and clean five-storey apartment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the stairs to the front of Room 303, Su Ge sorted out his face and knocked on the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A footstep sounded, and the voice followed: "Who?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's me , Sog Sotos."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, the footsteps suddenly rushed, and then the door was suddenly opened, with a freckle on one face. The cute blonde girl appeared in front of Su Ge, it was Evan's sister: Betty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sug, long time no see!" After seeing Su Ge, Betty took the lead to give Sug a big hug. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug also responded by holding her slightly petite body and laughing: "I am sorry, I am in a hurry to come back, without prior notice."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Betty let go of Su Ge and hurriedly ushered him into the house and smiled: "You are a bishop now, busy every day, you can still think about us, we It’s already very happy.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new house is very nicely decorated, with a white wall hanging with a family portrait and beautiful murals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ground is dark red solid wood flooring, and the living room sofa and coffee table are also covered with soft and comfortable blankets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just behind it is the window to the south. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time the sun shines in and is very warm and peaceful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sit down!" Betty hurried to the kitchen to pick up the teapot and pour the tea to Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge sat down and looked around: "What about your parents and Evan?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Parents went to work today, as for Evan... sleeping in the bedroom." Referring to his brother, Betty was a bit low. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug sighed and said, "It seems that I am right today."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Betty Put the teacup down and rub your eyes: "What have you heard?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly, something that I heard from Ivan simply said A bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Betty whispered after listening: "Thank you for being so concerned about my brother now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Su Ge swings his hand: "Don't see, my brother and I are good buddies who grew up together. This relationship will not be alienated because of the status. I will talk about the situation, if you really get I’m bullying and suppressing, I can help you.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Betty listened to some hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassure to say, I will help you to be fair." Su Ge has a strong confidence on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Betty listened deeply and said: "The main reason is because my brother improved the steam engine. Originally this thing was led by my brother. My brother published a paper. But in the course of the experiment, his mentor constantly interfered with him. Later, he also set up a research group for him. The fake person said that it helped my brother to study and brought in the damn aristocrat. My brother didn't think too much at the time, but when the research results appeared soon, he became an assistant, and the person who discovered and improved something became Mike Road."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At that time, I was not angry with my brother. I was asked to go to the theoretical result and beat my brother. I kicked my brother out of the group through the unscrupulous mentor and completely enjoyed me. Brother's invention!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
