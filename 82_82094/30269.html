			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early hours of the night, the streets of Bain’s suburbs are empty, and a layer of snow about five centimeters thick has been deposited on the road surface. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gas light on the white snow shines, and the reflected light makes the dark city brighter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this world, the suburbs of the night are relatively dangerous. Recently, five mysterious disappearances have occurred nearby, and now there is no one on the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug took a step by step with a second step, walking alone in the snowy streets, along the streets in memory, and soon came to the west of the city. A dilapidated condominium apartment in the suburbs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a four-story apartment for some years. The outer wall has been darkened, the wooden window frames are somewhat decaying, and the glass is full of dust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger’s home is on the fourth floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His parents were early to work from the countryside to the city, just in time to catch up with the policy reforms at the time, got a purchase of more than twenty years old house Opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two simple peasants got up early and bought a house with a pot of iron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge remembers through memory, in order to buy this house, he ate six months of sour-flavored sour bread. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, this is the case, and Su Ge was very happy at the time, because they finally had a house in the city, than in the simple dormitory where they lived in the factory. A lot more comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touching the trouser pocket, Sug took out a bunch of keys, opened the iron door outside, and walked up the iron staircase in front of the apartment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holding the handle to the corridor on the fourth floor, reaching the door to the far east, reaching out and knocking on the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hulala...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately, Su Ge heard inside through the dilapidated iron gate There was a mess of footsteps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in five seconds, the iron gate was opened instantly, and two teenagers, one male and one female, appeared in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl is in front of her, with a golden curl, fair skin and tall body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the baby's fat face with a touch of freckles, the lovely and lively face is full of worry and self-blame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the sister of Suger Sotos, Winnie Sotos, 20 years old, now a college at a women’s college, majoring in Accounting, and study literature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other boy is tall and tall, with a short blond hair, looks handsome, but the beard has not been scraped for two or three days and looks very decadent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the younger brother, Black Sotos, 19 years old, now attends the best Bain University in the city, majoring in construction machinery, taking part in painting . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at two people, Suge grinned and said: "Sorry, I am coming back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Silence for two seconds, two people suddenly fell into Suge's arms and burst into tears: "We are not good! We are not good! I beg you not to do this later, brother."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge raised his hand and hugged his brother and sister, and saw the two men crying, and their hearts suddenly became sour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two little guys thought that Su Ge’s disappearance was caused by his brother’s non-speaking for a month, and his heart was full of self-blame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not blame yourself, it doesn't matter to you, it's my problem. I and a few friends want to go out and earn some money, and I was cheated. Fortunately, you guys The brother of the brother is smarter and escapes." Su Ge said softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He cannot tell the story of being a cult as a test article. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, the two little guys suddenly sighed and hugged Su Ge and whispered, "Nothing is fine, nothing is fine."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, is there any leftover bread at home? I haven’t eaten anything other than just taking a bite of snow these days." Su Ge was joking. Say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winnie hurriedly said: "Black has brought his brother in, I am going to eat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bold and tall, Black easily put Sug back: "Finally It’s my turn to be yours, brother.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge older Black is 5 years old, and most of the time when he is busy with his work, Suge is taking care of Brother and sister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wang! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the second singer standing outside the door screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At this time the dog!?" Black glimpsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has not seen such a big, so beautiful dog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it looks a bit silly, it is pretty pretty. Black thought of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded and said, "Well, it is the key to my escape, and it is very spiritual and loyal, I want to raise it later."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black heard this, and suddenly felt awkward about this two ha, laughing and saying: "Thank you for saving my brother, come in!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Erha entered the room, Black plugged in the door and returned to the living room with Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The living room is small, only about 30 square meters, with a dilapidated sofa and two sets of tables and chairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After putting down Su Ge, Brian rushed out of the kitchen and put some firewood into the fireplace that was about to go out and re-ignited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; turned and pushed Su Ge’s sofa to the edge of the fireplace, then ran to the bedroom and took out a blanket to cover the Su Ge, while at the same time a warm boiled water . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second is quieter after coming in. It seems that it also likes warmth. At this time, he is at the foot of Su Ge, facing the warmth of the fireplace flame, and the comfort of his face. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug took a sip of hot water and felt a warm warmth flowing down his throat into his body, then quickly spread out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of warmth and comfort almost made Sugg out.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brian, who is busy with a circle, sat down: "It’s a goddess of March, you can be safe. Come back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge held a warm water glass and asked, "What happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Black said cautiously: "You may not know, when we went to the police, I heard the police say. Recently there was a group of cults who specifically deceived people and said that they can get huge knowledge and wealth. But in fact, people who cheated into them have become them. The guinea pig, either dead or turned into a horrible monster. Fortunately, it’s just an ordinary liar to lie to you, otherwise... the consequences are really unimaginable.”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge heard the heart and sighed: "My brother! You may not believe it, your brother has been cheated for more than half a year."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, he won’t really say it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Commend the March goddess, I am lucky." Su Ge put his left hand on his forehead, and his eyes closed slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a tribute to the movement of the March goddess, similar to the Christian cross. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Like the March goddess!" Black's grateful look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Winnie walked over a plate and said, "Fortunately, I left some bread and butter at home. There are still some potatoes left at night." Mud, let's eat it first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sister, you are a real savior." Su Ge was happy to take the plate, and then it was a gorge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wennie rubbed her hands on the apron and sat down with a happy face: "Slowly eat, don't pick it up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The taste and taste of grey bread is much better than the sour black bread. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The taste is a bit like a cake, but it's harder. I don't know before, the bread is buttered, and the mashed potatoes are so delicious!" Thought in my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
