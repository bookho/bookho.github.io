			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ps: After so long, I finally came here. Emmm, finally believe me once, this time Su Ge is really strong! ! ! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bell rang again, and under the gaze of the elf, a larger ripple spread out around the center of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The diffuse ripples are transmitted to her, and I don’t know why she actually trembled her body as if she had been greatly stimulated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A breeze blew through, and the solemn black robes of Sugna flew slightly, and the invisible pressure of pressure continued to spread around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes under the hood glanced at the elf next to them, and Su Ge’s low voice came from the hood: "Elves, look at it!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, Su Ge took another step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another ripple is transmitted, and Su Ge suffers more severe pain and pain in the foot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though Su Ge felt the spike pierced his calf along his heel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This spike will increase by one point each time you move forward. If you continue to go on, the spike will even penetrate the body of Suger along your legs. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Su Ge didn’t care about this. Now he has seen his goal. If he sees it, he will do everything and get it. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he said to Lance before: this has nothing to do with winning or losing, only related to his initial promise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The language of the gods is a must, Vanas, wait!" Su Ge clenched his teeth, and the pace went very steadily toward the other side of the lake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the pace progressed, the pain and injury became more serious, but Su Ge continued to move forward without fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not notice that in the position of the two shoulder blades behind him, four bulges under the black robe were slowly getting bigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf on the side looked at Su Ge like that, and he couldn’t return to God for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, when she returned to God, she found that Su Ge had already passed half of the lake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And behind him, the entire lake was dyed red by his blood, sparkling with strange colors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This kind of resonance, this voice, is not wrong, is his descendant!" The elf sorted out his long years and slowly recalled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the past that I don’t know. At that time, she just formed a young form of ignorance and ignorance. When she was playing by the lake, she found her own lake. It was polluted by a group of filthy evil spirits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, her strength was not strong, but she was very weak. She was about to dissipate with the pollution of the lake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In her desperate moment, accompanied by a thick bell, a tall figure wearing a black robe, wearing a skull mask and holding a dilapidated iron sword appeared At the lake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are four dark wings stretched out of his back, the long sword waving, accompanied by the scattered dark feathers, instantly destroying those evil spirits, saving She is dying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The elf, someone who violates the destiny, has smothered and released his soul to the Hades. Continue to survive."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, He waved his hand and smeared the corpse of the lake into a myriad of invisible powders, sinking into the lake and becoming a natural nourishment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scent of the lake is purified and cleaned in his bells and scattered black feathers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a mysterious place in the valley here, the elf, guarding this place, the dark age is about to pass, you will also welcome your own era. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long period of time, she fell asleep in a cold winter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She didn't know how long she slept. When she woke up, everything recovered and she was full of vitality. All the gods disappeared, and even the one who was already obscured in memory never appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole world seems to have entered a new era, as he said at the beginning, into the era of elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Returning from the distant and fuzzy memory, she saw that the familiar figure has gone two-thirds of the way, and the whole lake seems to be His blood is red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face gradually became solemn, and quickly slid toward Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug is still moving forward steadily, and the two spikes have penetrated his body into his body, seeming to have pierced him. Kidney on both sides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unspeakable pain makes his body a bit awkward and extremely tired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even just a squat, he stepped into the water below his feet and was almost pulled into the lake by the lake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it weren't for this powerful form of soul, the sound of the late bells kept my body at all times, and I guess I had already collapsed." I thought of a flash in my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking up and looking at the other side of the road, Su Ge snorted and started to run! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In this life, I want to be a conscience, absolutely no regrets, and God!" Su Ge groaned, feeling that he had pierced the liver, and The spikes in the lungs took a hard step and slammed on the shore of the lake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost carried the unconscious leg, Su Ge moved the other foot out of the lake. So far, Su Ge officially crossed the lake and came to the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With both hands holding the sword in front of him, Su Ge’s body was straight and slowly turned to see the elf of the lake that came slowly, with a low and hoarse The voice: "Elves, I arrived."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calling...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A breeze blows through the breeze, and the red-stained lake is restored to cleanliness, turning into a thorough blue again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, Su Ge lost his sensed legs, and the spirit of exhaustion quickly recovered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few breaths, pain and fatigue were swept away, spirited, thinking like electricity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This man, report your name." At this time, the elf's body gradually increased, and the lake condensed into the lower body of her long skirt, standing on the shore. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge calmly replies: "Sug Sotos."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ye Lan Did you accept this trial?" The elf was in a good tone and serious, and changed his mind with just the loneliness and disdain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded: "The people of a city are now threatened by cult rituals. I need stronger spirits to allow me to reverse this situation, so I Persuaded Lance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf’s green eyes sparkled with sparkling light, and the color said: "I apologize for my arrogance and rudeness, Su Ge · Sotos. My name is Audrey, the elf who guards the lake."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly, the dark hood could not see the Su The present state of mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sug Sotos, you have passed this no regrets test, I have witnessed your determination and witnessed your faith. Now, You are qualified to carry the holy mark of the lake."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she finished, her white palm waved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Invisible atmosphere gathered under her control at Su Ge, and then formed a circle of lake water at the foot of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rune style of "Lake" appears inside the circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soft energy is like a tentacle that touches Suge’s robes carefully and slowly blends into his soul through the robes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, Su Ge felt his consciousness suddenly flew up, and the next second he found that he was not flying, but his psionic energy was increasing rapidly, and the stretching of space gave the will a fly. The feeling of getting up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Su Ge felt that a large amount of lake water was poured into his spiritual space, nourishing his soul while rapidly expanding and consolidating the narrow spiritual space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哗啦啦......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the explosive growth of psionics, the four of Su Ge’s back The bulge quickly rose, and finally stretched out from under the robes and turned into four pieces of black wings like the wings of a crow. The dark feathers scattered around Su Ge, and the side of the lake is full of joy and gratification. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know how many years, I finally saw this dead feather that symbolizes sacredness and purification!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge did not notice the appearance of Audrey, at this time he was feeling the comfort brought by his own spiritual surge, and the soul of the complete evolution of the whole sense of refreshment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The emergence of this wing of death represents that I have thoroughly passed on all the knowledge that He has hidden in the book, and it is also a sign that the heart and the night bell are completely integrated. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, Su Ge felt a weird look when he saw the four wings tattooed. All tattoos are the realization of mysterious knowledge, not the cool tattoos of the second child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the wings appear on the big clock, there must be a corresponding existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And after seeing the wing, Su Ge has a kind of instinctive discomfort, as if something hidden in his body is hidden in his body. Because of insufficient nutrition, it cannot grow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This feeling is very uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now with the growth of the wings, Su Ge has a sense of excitement from beginning to end, just like the first time when the butterfly is turned into a butterfly . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time doesn't know how long it has passed, and Su Ge, who has returned to God, looks at Audrey and looks at herself with a unique vision, which is very special. Feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
