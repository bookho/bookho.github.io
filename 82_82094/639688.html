			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert and Su Ge quickly left after he finished speaking, and he seems to have other things to deal with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then two people went to the Ten Victory Gate to see Father Sini. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father, as he said, he did his duty during the day and patrolled around the Tokachi gate on time to ensure the safety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After receiving a positive reply from Su Ge, Father Cagne nodded with satisfaction and then asked: "Have you heard of the organization of the late bell church?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly: "I heard some, but I don't know much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" How do you feel about this church?” Father Sini sat on the bench and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge shook his head: "Not very well understood, not too good to say. This organization seems to be a bit too mysterious, and the mysterious world and their related intelligence are few." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French Sini nodded thoughtfully, then switched to the topic and said, "Do you know what happened yesterday at the Jura Cemetery?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" asked Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French Sini simply said something last night, but covered up all the monsters' things without any traces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What did the church do late?" Su Ge asked unexpectedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French Sini shook his head: "No, I have played with the guy. He is not malicious to the clergy."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge sighed: "Unfortunately, there are a few clergymen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French Sini said coldly: "Their sacrifice to the church For the sake of the consumables, no one feels that their sacrifices have value.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“And then, what are your plans?”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The murderer is a cold-hearted church, I want to smash these guys!" Father Sini clenched his fists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why can you see?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The owner of the tomb that was destroyed at the time was called Motley Tom. I used to serve the church. I left the church two years ago to become a free mystery. Sudden death was buried there a month ago, and his brain was stolen. The only thing that makes such disgusting things is the cold-hearted church. Ghoul."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded: "Is there any need for help?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Father Cagnes shook his head: "I don't need it for a while, I will let the demon notice you when I need it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farewell with Father Sini Afterwards, Shirley casually said: "He didn't tell the truth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, I am an outsider. The man named Motley Tom, The identity should be very special. As for why the secret treasure will be buried with the body and was first discovered by the cold-hearted church, this requires an in-depth investigation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb Sp;&nbsp; "Do you have a clue to the ghoul?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are some, but the situation is too fragmented, I can feel a certain faint People are in the layout, but they don't feel anything else." Su Ge sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next two people went directly to the clinic that Emilia said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The location of the two people is in the south of the city. It takes about three hours to reach the clinic in the east of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then two people took the steam locomotive directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steam locomotive in the city was very efficient, and it took only 20 minutes for the two people to reach the corner of the returning street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The east of the city is a relatively old city, the overall architectural style is biased towards quaint, very tense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although not as bright and refined as Beth Street, it is also very distinctive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the streets are relatively small and old-fashioned buildings, and even the shops on both sides of the street are very small. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This does not affect the traffic of these stores. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But because of the limited space, these small shop interiors and space arrangements are exquisite and elegant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking on some narrow roads, Su Ge looked at the overcast trees in front and the old houses on both sides, and suddenly reminded him of his original The days of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"咦!? Mr. Assassin!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, a full accident The sound came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug turned his head and saw the accidental discovery of the heroine on the ship, Miss Mary, and the sexy lady in red, Miss Angie behind her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary saw that Sug was still very happy, but Angie’s face was awkward and he didn’t talk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looked at the faces of two people and found that Mary’s looks and temperament were good, but Angie looked very gloomy, his face was dark and his eyes were heavy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Haha, it’s a coincidence. How did you come here today?" Su Ge asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary said truthfully: "Angie seems to be ill, I took her to see the disease."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "See a doctor? Myra Clinic?" Su Ge asked. Mary said no, "Mr. Myra is still very famous. I have seen several diseases here. Effective."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge was amazed, his eyes swept around Angie and found that she had many mysterious traces on her body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary asked curiously: "Are you also seeing a doctor?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug Head, pointing to his own red eyes: "The eyes are a little uncomfortable, my cousin recommended me here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, then you can come to the right place."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then four people talked and moved forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, only Su Ge and Mary have a word to talk without a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;尴尬 Anji directly bowed his autism, and Shirley disdain to say a word to these inferior creatures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What kind of person is Dr. Myra?" Su Ge asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary thought about it, then said: "It's very beautiful, very clean, very kind, the voice is very soft, very nice, like a big sister." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hearing this, Su Ge thought about it, so he immediately made up an Ada II. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After licking his head, he took this impression out, and Su Ge asked, "How have you been in these days?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary smiled: "I am fine, blood and wine is very useful, I feel that I have escaped from that nightmare."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, Mary glanced at Angie and sighed: "Unfortunately, blood wine is too expensive, and my assets cannot be used all the time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; During the conversation, four people stopped in front of a dilapidated big iron gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a fairly spacious yard behind the iron gate, and there is a black four-wheeled carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front is a very quaint and huge three-storey villa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this villa seems to be a mosaic of several houses, not only very strange, but even the front door is somewhat narrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How come there is no one?" Su Ge looked curious and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s as Mary said, it’s going to be very hot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
