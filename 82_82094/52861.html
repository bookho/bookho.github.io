			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dare to be right with our Green Flame Brotherhood, will not die." The black robe whispered in Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s eyes widened at this moment, looking at the dagger inserted in his chest, unable to speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black robes skillfully pulled out the dagger, and the left hand pinched Suger’s shoulder and whispered, “So, go to hell!”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, the dagger once again slammed into the chest of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The madman! This guy is totally an avid madman!" Sug clenched and kicked his foot as the dagger inserted his chest again. On the belly of the black robe, pull away the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What!?" The black robe who was kicked a kick was surprised and looked at Su Ge incredibly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a breather, and he looks down at his chest. The pierced left chest does not have any blood, although the skin is cracked, except for the faint The blue mist slowly flowed out, without a trace of blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sure enough, in the heart, I am completely inhuman!" Su Ge thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black robes here see Su Ge, who is still alive and kicking, and the big, depressed eyes whisper: "This is impossible!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he screams, he feels that his right hand is a little cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he turned his head and did not get the blood of his impression on his dagger, but did not know why the bright dagger began to freeze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hurry to throw away the dagger, the black robe yelled: "What the hell are you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg squeezed his cane here and said calmly: "You are not a madman here, if you don't want to die, leave!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black After the robe listened, the pale face flashed a burst of anger and distortion, and shouted: "Despicable pagan! I want to kill you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, the horrible physical fitness rushed up, and the fist in his hand slammed into the chest of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What the hell is this lip is not right for the ponytail! This guy has no way to communicate properly!" Su Ge scalp numb, whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This mad believer has no reason at all and logic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black robes here punched on the chest of Su Ge, directly hitting Su Ge back five steps, sitting on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I..." This punch is very embarrassing, and the coloring of Su Ge is pale and even breathless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Kill you! Kill you, I will kill the traitor Bart again!" The black robe whispered and rushed over. This time, the fist hit the Su Ge head directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What to do! My chest is resistant, my head can't do it!" Su Geqiang endured the feeling of suffocation, his head spinning rapidly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is empty, and melee completely suppresses me, so the empty-handed melee will only die. I need a weapon! I need a weapon that can penetrate his body!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the electric frite, Su Ge swept around his eyes, and the next moment, Su Ge’s eyes fell on his cane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Weapons! Give me a weapon!" Looking at the black robes who rushed over, Sug grabbed his cane and stabbed him directly to the black robes who rushed over. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cane has changed from a long gun, and because of Su Ge’s thoughts, he became a cane. Now Su Ge hopes that he can become a more powerful weapon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the spread of Su Ge's thoughts, the surface of the cane flashed a faint, cold blue light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black robes saw this pagan actually stabbed himself with a worn palm, grinning and laughing: "Dead!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Su Ge’s chest, the black robe man opened the cane between the two, and the other hand squeezed his fist to the head of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge was also provoked by this madman at this time, and he said: "Go to death! You crazy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next second...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pump! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black robe was awkward, and the intense pain made him almost fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug violently gasps, holding the handle of the cane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side, the original cane has become a sharp, full of barbs and blood troughs, and the sword has not only cut black The half of the palm of the robe was also stabbed into his shoulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood is silently low, staining the white snow on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is fierce, whispered: "Let me die? Then you go to hell!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Low, Su Ge’s hand clenched this sword and slammed it back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The barb and the blood splatter of the body of the black robes that were cut in the blood trough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kill! Kill! I killed you!" At this time, the black robe was completely mad, and the boss of the mouth was stunned, revealing the white teeth, the whole The thin face is not distorted, regardless of the blood on his body, open his arms and rush toward Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug has been relieved here, and the body tumbling backwards, and his hand is suddenly slamming forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;铮铮铮...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a long sword full of barbed blood Suddenly like a spring, the old shackles, the barbs and the blood troughs directly split open by a flat flat sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the blink of an eye, the long sword that has just been turned into a full two-and-a-half-long, full of sharp edges, like a huge silver chain sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chain sword that was opened was drawn from the left side with the whistling wind to the black robe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next second, the harsh screams ring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chain sword full of sharp edges is like a whip on his body, instantly tearing open his clothes, flesh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After winding a circle, he directly locked his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kill! Kill!" The black robe struggles with desperation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;噗嗤...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large amount of blood is sprayed with the falling flesh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being entangled in such a blade-filled weapon is still struggling, and there is no difference between being stirred into a blender. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looked at the crazy black robes, clenched the hilt, and looked surprisingly calm. It is not the quality of his heart, this is the effect of meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black robes locked by the chain sword did not escape the possibility of escaping, only struggling for less than thirty seconds, the fleshy body was lost because More blood and body tissues lose their mobility, and they die on the snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge's wrist slightly moved, and the chain sword gradually contracted into a sword form. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then Su Ge lifted it down hard, all the barbs and blood tanks above quickly contracted and disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the blink of an eye, the chain sword of the skull is like a transformer, and it becomes an ordinary cane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge looked down at the cane in his hand, a kind of intimate feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It turns out that this is your true form." Su Ge thought of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at his own blood in a blink of an eye, Su Ge looked at the black robes who had already died, and the blood and minced meat on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
