			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ivan, who knows this material?" Su Ge asked seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug has just made up for it, and he can already imagine the chaos that this metal will cause in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because this metal corresponds to the Dai, but mysterious! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, this bullet can be used on mystery! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Amount, this is what I just researched, you are the first to know." Ivan said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s hands held his shoulders and said seriously: “Ivan, you remember. This metal should not be known by anyone, and will not be used from now on. Show and research in front of anyone, do you know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" Ivan asked unexpectedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge seriously said: "Because he will cause chaos in the entire mysterious circle, you have to know that this metal is mysterious, not against the magic, if this The metal was made into a bullet by the bad guys and attacked our clergy!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, Ivan’s face was white, and he only remembered this follow-up. The horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "These things are best destroyed! Don't tell anyone, including Father Anthony!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Speaking, Su Ge whispered in Ivan’s ear: "There are traitors in the church. I can’t judge who is a good person, who is a bad person. Remember, this matter is firmly in the bottom of my heart. Know, do you know that I know, understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understand!" Ivan suddenly nodded with a firm expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two months of intimacy, Su Ge is now his most trusted and intimate person, he found a long-lost family feeling in Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This gun and bullet are also destroyed!" Su Ge bowed his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listening to his face, Ivan said, "This is what I specially made for you... can you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at him poorly So, Su Ge thought about it, then smiled and said: "Well, these things I keep first, when to use, how to use me to study, how?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Good!" Suddenly, Ivan smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Su Ge was like a thief, he quickly left the place with his gun and bullets and returned to his chapel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First hide these two things, and Suge breathed a sigh of relief into the bathroom for a shower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ivan is still at ease with this matter, this matter is not a concern for the time being."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Then the focus is on tomorrow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But before that, there seemed to be some problems with that restaurant." Sug squinted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the words left by the soul two months ago, they were all attracted by the food and killed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The coffee, some of it is too much. How can a high concentration of coffee have that taste?" Su Ge, who drinks high-concentration coffee for a long time clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no one of the best coffees, which means that you really have the ability to attract those victims. If that's the case, the waiter, or the boss is very It may be a person who is cold-hearted in the church. And the waiter I looked very familiar, I obviously haven’t seen him, why is it familiar? Because I saw a flash of light that night, I want to attract my attention. Ghoul. The two men look different, but they have a vague similarity in their spiritual temperament."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Su Ge’s eyes flashed a chill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If this is the case, I am very likely to know the conversation with Roland. If it is really related to them, there will definitely be an ambush tomorrow, and it can still be The one that kills both of us and kills!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I have to go tomorrow, because I have to use this to determine the coherence and logic of the whole thing, and some of the hidden possibilities!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; After soaking for ten minutes, Su Ge stood up and took out the hidden moon, and carefully placed the bullet into the magazine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have been studying for firearms for a long time, I can't talk about the sharpshooter, but the close-range shooting of about ten meters is still no problem."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pinch the cold handle, Su Ge eyes flashing cold: "Since you are looking for death, then don't blame me for using some unconventional means."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dream, Su Ge once again deduced the whole thing through the mind of the gods, and found that all the key results are whether there is an ambush tomorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If so, then the entire process can be said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, Su Ge went to the quest department to send the corpse behind the bat and five pairs of water ghost ears, on behalf of the task has been processed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the delivery, return to the chapel to put on a more casual casual wear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a jazz cap on the head, a blue denim jacket on the upper body, and black trousers and ankle boots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This line is perfect, it is easy to act without being noticed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hand is on the cane, and the new cane is as old as before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The restraint of the small ghoul was put on the body, and two bonuses were brought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last time Fulan was placed under the arm, while Su Ge also brought an extra two clips to prevent accidents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything is ready, Sug goes out at will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey? Where are you going to wear such a low profile?" When he was about to go out, he met Father Anthony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
