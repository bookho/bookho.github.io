			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adeline and Earl at the entrance to the temple did not dare to move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The screams in the ear have subsided, but this silence without any voice gives an indescribable sense of oppression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of the female warrior full of oppression is now coming again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just my lord said, you performed very well, Adeline."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen At this point, Adeline’s heart trembled, but then there was more surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"%@%#!¥..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two more came out of the temple A voice that the individual cannot understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the two people have been slightly adapted to listening to such a voice at this time, once again, they still feel tremendous pressure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like a mountain is pressed against your own soul. If you are a little careless, you will be completely squashed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My Lord said that Bain City is the city he sheltered. It is a great sin to summon the filthy things here."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two people suddenly sink to the bottom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"¥@%......##%"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My lord said that his apostles I got your help, you didn't participate, so my boss didn't mean to blame you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adeline was deeply relaxed after listening to it. Tooth, the voice said cautiously: "Thank you for the magnificence and kindness of the great storm and the Lord of death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"%@#@#..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female warrior continues to explain as a spokesperson: "There is still the lingering thing in the city, and the Lord asks you to help the apostles of my Lord to clean these people. If I The Lord's apostles recognize your attitude and loyalty, and you can accept the sanctuary of my Lord and become the people of my Lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing this, Adeline’s heart flashed a bit of excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get a shelter that can now show the gods in the real world, which is more affordable and direct than admiring the illusory ancient gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for the magnanimity and kindness of the Lord of Great Death and the Storm." Adeline’s head was attached to the cold ground, and her attitude was respectful and excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"......¥@%#@¥"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female warrior’s head slightly turns and looks The Earl, who has been piously on the ground, asks: "The young vampire - Randall Montgomery, your piety and respectfulness make my Lord feel happy. You are different from those who are ignorant and filthy. What do you want?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl listened to a cautious and rigorous voice: "I am willing to give everything to me, praying for the great death and the Lord of the storm to make me absolutely eager for blood." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"......¥#..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My lord said that you are very self-aware There are problems with those inferior blood. Your long-term drinking will gradually be swallowed up by the animal. Your wisdom has won the approval of my master."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Count After listening to my heart, "It’s a great god, this is a problem that our family spent three thousand years to discover!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shocked Afterwards, the count was extremely pious and admired, whispering: "It is the most sacred and glorious moment of my eight hundred years of life to be praised by the Lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"%#@............&amp;#"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My lord said that I want to get paid first. Join my apostle to form The church helps him to carry forward the glory of my Lord. After proving your piousness and loyalty, you will be freed from this blood curse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl listened Almost all of the people were kneeling on the ground, yelling at the highest level of worship. "Ah! My omnipotent lord, I, Randall Hearst Montgomery, Jiasilan, to the Hearst family. The blood of origin, bloody holy pool swears: From now on, my Randall Hearst Montgomery Kass blue will become the most loyal servant of my Lord, the most devout believer. The glory of my Lord will replace March. The light, the body of my Lord will replace everything in the world, the voice of my Lord will be the creed of my life, the majesty of my Lord is me The soul of the whips, our Lord's mercy will be my eternal peace ............ "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;This kind of prayer speech similar to the vows said that it took five minutes to stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female warrior and the surrounding soldiers listened, and the look was very shocked, and then hurriedly wrote down it for future use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The uncomfortable voice once again came from the depths of the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female warrior converges to continue to explain: "My Lord feels your determination and piety, and goes back and acts to show his loyalty."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!" the count said loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the temple, Su Ge said with a trace of surprise: "It’s a high-level vampire who has lived for eight hundred years. It is said that thousands of words are not repetitive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are advanced vampires and a female warlock, and the forces in the real world are strong enough. What is needed after that is to slowly develop and improve other things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is nothing to say next, let them go, the clothes are tired Su Ge said to start the language again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the deck, the female soldier said loudly: "Now you can retire, and then the apostle of my Lord will find you."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, and the long bell rang again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole conversation begins with a bell and ends with a bell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle, two people felt that countless fogs wrapped up two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a severe dizziness, the two opened their eyes and found themselves sitting in a chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at each other across the seat and then take off the mask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After such a thing, even in the future, to become a church compatriot, now there is no need to hide in each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, I have drawn this clear road for me." Randall is still so polite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adeline smiled and said, "You're welcome, this is what I should do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Simple conversation, looking at each other's sincere smile, the relationship between the two people suddenly tightened a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hehehe...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Silly laughter sounds in the dark space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two turned their heads and saw the other four people, the curator (Grimman), the stars, the dark hands, the hyenas were completely silly at this time. The body was weakly leaning on the chair, his eyes were dull, his face was pale, his mouth was screaming like a demented child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The saliva lingered down their mouths on their handsome robes, giving a very strange visual impact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What should these four people do?" Adelion asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Randall said with a cold on his face: "These people are the ones who have smashed my lord. Although they are already crazy, they are still filthy. Since it is a filthy thing that taints my main city, naturally there is no need to keep it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adeline nodded after listening: "But before we deal with it, The two are best to see the Lord's apostle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recalling this, Randall looked blank and then smiled and said: "I seem to know that Who is the Lord's Apostle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? How do you know?" Adeline didn't know that Sug knew Randall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Randall’s face is solemn: “Only those who hold that surname are qualified to be my followers of the world. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sotos? Is there any problem with this surname?" Edelin, a learned student, frowned, and nothing in his mind seemed to be very common. Introduction of the last name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Randall is silent, with a solemn warning: "I don't know who is fearless (note!), some things don't know too much, it is good for you, A little girl who is learned."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
