			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing what Macock spit out, Suggton of the heart had some retching, and hurriedly turned his head and did not look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike Su Ge, Father Rogan and Anthony seem to see something at this time, his face is very dignified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogan hurriedly took out a pair of silver-gray gloves and took a step forward to pinch one of the carrion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shasha...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge once again heard the strange friction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turning his head to lock in the middle of Rogan's two fingers, seeing Rogan pinching an invisible thing that is only the size of a thumb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg still can't see what it is, only Rogan can hold the finger like the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain Rogan, this is..." Father Anthony was dignified and looked a little hesitant, somewhat uncertain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogen nodded and said, "Yes, the high-level scorpion monster of sequence three requires a macrophary worm larva that can be contacted with 37 points of sight."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a giant worm!!" Su Ge heard this, and his heart suddenly rose a chill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although I don't know if the black man is still here, but it is certain that he left behind his back here and began to premeditate new The plan."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogan turned to look at the meditation of Su Ge, applauded and said: "Sug, you are doing very well. Although rash Going to the clinic is a bit reckless and impulsive, but the decision-making and execution you have to deal with in the whole process makes me look good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Anthony also knows from the descriptions of Roland Su Ge’s performance in the clinic, patted his shoulder and said with a face: “Sure enough, the eyes of the master and the bishop are not wrong, you are doing very well.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge returned with a smile and said: "Work hard for so long, how can you make progress?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It would be better if you can be more stable next time." Rogan said, he took out a lacquered black, silver-colored bottle and put the larvae that Sug couldn't see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug has also learned the lesson this time and nodded hard and said: "The next time I will pay attention, now I think back, this action is a bit too self-righteous." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogan put down the bottle and smiled: "Don't think too much. I don't disagree with the case alone, but you are still very shallow now, and it's easy to act alone. There is a problem. You are now our core seed, we can't let you grow up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge knows what he means, laughs Nodded a little: "Thank you for your concern, Captain Rogan, and Father Anthony."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a simple education about Su Ge, Rogan turned and looked at it. Macock's body: "The inside of his body has been more seriously corroded by these things, and the spirit is deeply affected, and can only be handed over to Father Hank. If it is treated in time, there is hope for complete cure." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, Rogan passed his own unique bell Cang know who Hank took the priests and nuns in charge of the relevant cleaning in the clergy will quickly transport the horse Hancock left three people, including the hall to sit down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Father’s frowning analysis: “This is a bit too strange.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogan drank a cup of coffee: "If Roland is right, then the source of all the problems is on the dead pregnant woman. The pregnant woman may have died abnormally, and someone is facing her belly. The child has a poisoned hand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "According to the habit of the corpse of Macock, he is mostly influenced by the ghouls of the cold-hearted church." Father Anthony analyzed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg thought about it and asked, "What is the worm of this giant worm?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Rogan explained: "The macrophage worm is a superior independent ancestor, and the adult worms need 50 points to be in contact. All the ancestors are not creatures of this world, and their living habits are different. According to records, macrophages The process of worm growth requires engulfing minerals and nutrients, and requires a certain amount of life. There is no place in our world of nature that meets these conditions at the same time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So they will parasitize in the human body, get minerals and nutrients by swallowing the bones of the human body?" Su Ge suddenly remembered the dead baby without bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogen nodded: "Yes, the question now is who put the larvae of this giant worm into the body of the pregnant woman." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg wants to say it at this time, but then swallows it when he speaks, because this thing is not understood now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least I don’t understand from my mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Anthony stood up and said, "I am going to fight the nuns now and martial the dangerous clinic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogan puts his hand on it: "Now is the festival of the moon, and your work should not be changed rashly, especially when our deployment is not chaotic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recalling the last ghost ship thing, Father Anthony was full of vigilance: "Good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogan looked at the pocket watch and said: Temporarily let the police have a little control. Don't let anyone approach the clinic. There are still three and a half hours of darkness. I used to look at it at night."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good! I am going now Prepare.” Father Anthony nodded hard and turned and left quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then Rogan turned to look at Su Ge: "You are ready to go with me at night. When Gerlos left, let me take you with me." I am going to wait for you to take care of things after a month of adaptation. Since you are so strong, come together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this matter Su Ge naturally refuses to resist. He is eager to say: "Okay, I am going to prepare now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the back of Su Ge’s departure, Rogan reminds To: "According to what you just described, most of this mysterious event has a relationship with the ghoul and the ghost. When you prepare, bring some silver dust and a ray, and there is a tiger blood medicine that can break the mysterious mind of the ghost. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good!" Su Ge nodded, ready to go to the logistics department and get some equipment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
