			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh! Right, I heard that this beautiful lady humiliated a mysterious aristocrat in the restaurant yesterday." Drake sneaked Suddenly thought of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking in his heart, his eyes fell on Su Ge’s face with a trace of pity on his face: “It’s pitiful, his fiancee immediately became those nobles. "Playing things in the palm of your hand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What a beautiful person, it will soon be humiliated." He suddenly thought of what a great philosopher said: "In this In the barbaric era of barbarism, beauty is the greatest original sin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I heard that every witch is also very beautiful, and it is estimated that the threats of those witches are fictitious. The witches who have been arrested have become the playthings of those big men."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Drake’s mind suddenly made up a lot of tragic scenes of death and death. And the beautiful girl was stunned, tearful and weeping... stimulating scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn, I am thinking about something!" Drake knocked on his head and cursed in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the corridor not far from Drake, Su Ge found that no one had passed through it for five minutes, and it was estimated that the two sides were temporarily blocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss Newton, I suggest that you better advise your fiancé, and hope that he will not do something that makes my family unhappy, otherwise the consequences will be very serious. "The middle-aged man looked at Shirley with a warning." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Shirley seems to be dumb, the dark eyes are disdainful and cold, and it seems that he has not heard the warning of the middle-aged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge stepped forward and shook Snowl’s hand in one hand, keeping Shirley behind him, as if a brave man was protecting himself. Wife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now is a society ruled by law. Do you think that the old paper tigers of this age can do whatever they want with their power?" Su Ge’s big question was awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man has no leisure and what the idealistic grass-roots say, his boss has already showered, waiting for this glamorous and attractive woman accompany. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Catch him up, don't kill it." The middle-aged man said faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, the surrounding crew members walked gloomyly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dreek not far away saw an envious sigh: "When can I achieve this status and power?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a suspicious sigh: "Do you want to reach this level?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The middle-aged man sneered and did not speak, ready to look at this nonsense, the poor boy was beaten and beg for mercy, and at the same time to the beautiful lady to declare the authority of his own gentleman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time a big man suddenly reached out and grabbed the neck of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger’s body motionless, the hand that the big man just stretched out seemed to suddenly touch something, and then he took two steps back, and his hands felt a feeling of numbness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What?!" The middle-aged man and Drake in the distance saw the problem at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two of them found out at the same time that Su Ge repelled the strong man by what invisible things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it..." The middle-aged man saw what he suddenly thought of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg then extended his right hand with black leather gloves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a time, everyone’s attention was drawn to the black leather gloves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A crisp fingering came from the two fingers, and in the blink of an eye, a layer of sly light flashed past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment of hearing this, all six people, including middle-aged people, were all in the same place, and their faces were sluggish and stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get in." Su Ge said, pulling Shelly's hand and moving forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six people nodded after listening to the sluggishness, and stepped into the cabin next to them. Finally, the middle-aged man was blind and closed the door, and there was no movement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl, who was started by Socrata, feels a little unaccustomed, but looking at the palms of each other, the brows are slightly wrinkled, it seems to feel good, there is no As usual, I will open Sug. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why don't you kill all six of them?" Shelly pouted, and asked some dissatisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge casually said: "Trouble."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl thought for a moment, not talking . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Drake, who is not far away, sees that this is completely stupid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it... Is these two people the legendary mystery!? God! The mystery is so powerful!" Drake was in a state of mind at this time. Excited, I feel that my worldview has been refreshed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After determining that the two people were gone, he hurried out and opened the cabin where the first officer and others entered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open the door and see that the six people are standing there as if they are dead, and their eyes are sluggish, just like being hypnotized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Too strong! Too handsome!" Drake's expression was a little distorted, and ran out of the cabin and watched the two people leave in the direction of excitement: "Fortune God bless, I finally came into contact with that mysterious world! This time, I must seize the opportunity!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on the hull of the hull, Shirley Er licked his hair and put it behind his ear and asked Su Ge: "The hidden mouse, don't you deal with it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug saw This action is a bit sluggish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because this action is exactly the same as Ada’s habit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shelly looked at Su Ge’s expression, and there was a vicious smirk in her mouth: “How? Have you fallen into the taboo’s brotherhood fantasy?” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge blinked his eyes and sighed back and said: "Can your heart be sunny?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You make a evil god inner sunshine? Your head is sick "?" Shirley said very rudely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looked at the same beautiful face as Ada, but there was no feeling of facing Ada in his heart. Every time he looked at this face, he didn’t know it. His heart is filled with lust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that Shirley is born with absolute attraction and suppression, so that he can not get out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The mouse is a bard who has seen the stalker. I can feel his spirit is mutating because of exposure to something. I need him to be a The bait attracts those dark locusts. The only way to encounter those mysterious people is to find me, the only mysterious person he knows, for help, so that I can burn all the mites through him."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not stupid." Xue Lier said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge has long been used to her yin and yang sigh of relief, looking down at the waves after the cruise ship said: "My identity is good, what about you? After all, it will be inseparable for a while."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Speak first of you." Shelly said first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge touched the holy grail of his right hand and said: "As just as I am, I am a psychologist who is good at psychological hypnosis, this and me. The academic qualifications are very close. Next, my core means are mainly the illusion produced by sound, and the soul of the soul holy grail. The mysterious occupation is the hypnotist."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "As for the appearance, there is no need to change, my own sense of existence with the Holy Grail of the soul has changed because of the particularity of the Holy Grail. The mysterious people of ordinary people and masters can't remember me at all." Said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The name is just like the fake identity given by Vanas, Odin Assassin, this name I thought for a long time, wasting so many brain cells "How much should play a role."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Odin Assassin? How is this name so strange? It feels a bit nonsense." Shirley brow Said slightly wrinkled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge smiled and waved: "This name is very meaningful and very suitable for my current identity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl did not say much, she never called The name of Su Ge, the name does not affect her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look at the very comfortable face you have served me for the past year and a half, I will reward you and play this game with you once. "Sheryl said high up." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled and said in his heart: "You have not served me less."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My name is Azshara Newton. The level of thought of Vanas is barely good. I am satisfied with the background and logic of identity." Shirley is very fond of Vanas, and has praised Vana for a year and a half. No less than ten times, this is twice as many as the number of times he praised Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mysterious identity is a dark-skinned female warlock. On the surface, my profession is a historian and explorer. My identity is your fiancee, and you don't have to change your appearance. Because Ada has already proved her, they can't remember my appearance, only know that I am very beautiful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, Suggton remembered When Ada left Bain, all the memories related to her were transferred to her own body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What does it mean?" Su Ge asked seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was the first time he heard the term, and it was the first time that Shirley had mentioned his sister so directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shelly held her chin and looked at the waves in the fence and said, "Verify the cause and effect, engrave your name in history and time, and the representative has already jumped out. Causal fate is a sign of becoming a saint."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Su Ge remembered that Ada’s mysterious profession was a saint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the sign of becoming a saint?" Su Ge is very curious about this profession. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shelly looked at him and said: "The sage needs not knowledge, but opportunity and savvy. It is epiphany in professional vocabulary."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
