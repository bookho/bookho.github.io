			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the muddy village road of Laihua Village, Su Ge suddenly misses his days on the earth. After all, he will not get both feet when he is in the spring. It is mud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哞哞...汪汪...噗呲呲<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cow’s cry, the dog’s howl, The nose of the horse came from the courtyard on both sides of the road, and it was mixed with people who were far or near. Su Ge felt that he had returned to his childhood home in the countryside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This priest, are you a clergyman?" asked an old man with a black, worn jazz hat and a rough leather coat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled and said, "Yes, I am the clergy of the church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the old man sighed with relief: "Thank God, you have finally come."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The names of the church people are roughly divided into two categories, one is the church staff. It is an ordinary church staff who is responsible for the work of the normal church and for prayer, sacrifice, baptism, and assistance related work, like Ada and Julie, who are church members. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other is the clergyman who the old man calls, and the clergyman refers to the church members who are in contact with the mysterious and responsible for the mysterious events. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because they have the extraordinary power, they are more likely to be exposed to the grace of the goddess, and at the beginning they were called the mysterious office staff, slowly being simplified for the priesthood. personnel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger's temptation asks: "You are..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man took off his hat and showed a head The white hair said: "My name is Martin Richardson, the village head of Laihua Village, which is the application I sent to the church the day before yesterday."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear this Su Ge smiled and said: "I am very happy to be serious, Richardson village chief, my name is Su Ge Sotos, this is the clergyman who came to deal with small blood bats."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the easy-going Su Ge, Richardson’s village chief was very happy and enthusiastically sent Su Ge to the middle of the village, specifically for the meeting room with the superior leadership. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sitting down, a good middle-aged woman gave Sog a cup of black tea, and the village chief Richardson began to talk about the situation in detail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This group of small blood bats suddenly appeared in the woods to the east this year and killed two villagers who entered the woods to fight wood."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two people who died, the old village chief looked sad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge asks: "What can you say in detail? The location and number of blood bats."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp The old village chief recalled: "They often appear in the poplar forest on the hillside. There are several bones of the beasts nearby. It is estimated that they are lighted by them. The number is about thirty, this is The first amount. Now they ran to our village every night to suck blood. More than a dozen villagers have been attacked and injured. Two cows and one horse were killed by this group of small animals!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg heard this brow and was locked into meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old village chief saw Su Ge’s look suddenly: "Mr. Sotos, can this solve it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly: "The problem is not big, the situation is similar to what I expected, but I have a problem to confirm."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You say."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Small vampire bats have only a pair of tiny hollow teeth for bloodsucking, no canines and incisors. They can't Any organization that eats beasts, you just said that there are a lot of bones nearby, what is going on?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old village chief thought about it and said: "Oh! It may have been eaten by that madman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maniac!?" Su Ge brows a pick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old village chief nodded: "About two years ago, there was a madman in the woods near the village. He was full of hair, and everything was crazy." Eat. Although not sensible, but very afraid of people. Because it is not threatening, but the forest is safe because of his appearance, so we did not care."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;"Two years ago? Crazy? Full body hair?" Su Ge caught the key point of the matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old village chief smiled and said: "Occasionally I can see it once in two years. I will see it when I see it. It is like a wild monkey. He sometimes kills." Some beasts eat, if you are lucky, we can pick up some remaining meat and fur behind him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this Su Ge's inner thoughts: "Does this guy have anything to do with the thing two years ago?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, basically I have already understood." Su Ge stood up Ready to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old village chief asked: "Can you solve it? Need our help?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "No, tell me which forest is the best." Su Ge said freely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This mysterious thing is inconvenient for ordinary people to see. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Afterwards, Su Ge followed the instructions of the old village chief, walked out from the road to the east of the village, and came along the winding road to the foot of a hill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This mountain is not big, it can only be regarded as a earthen bag, the height is only a few tens of meters, the hillside is gentle, and there are dense trees on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snow on the hillside has not melted yet, but there are many trails that the predecessors stepped on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge took out a two-finger size, all black, like a soft meat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the body of a small blood bat, which was given to him by an Orion when he first came out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge squatted down and handed the body of the blood bat to the second road: "Come, smell."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Second Haker came over and the dark nose moved, then sneezed and a look of disgust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, I will give you beef at night, a pound and a half, and now I will find them by the temperature remaining in the air." Su Ge touched him and bowed. Smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
