			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony still wants to say, but he is pulled by his companions and falls silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge quietly listened to the side, and now he has no right to speak, can only listen to orders from superiors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Gerlos turned his head and said to Su Ge: "I now ask you to ask the truth of the matter through the soul here as soon as possible, and then Soul purification."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge heard a shock and turned to look at the soul of the ship: "Master, this is too much, to my present The ability to exceed three or four is exhausted."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three or four? You are too confident about yourself, child." Father Anthony said in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss didn’t take it easy, he took out a pill bottle and said, "Low-level shark potion can greatly stimulate your spirit and make your spirit and spirit Can temporarily increase by three times, more than the sacred potion toxin, but at the most, you will be seriously ill, not fatal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge After taking the potion, some of them did not return to God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly let yourself eat the potion that only the demon hunter can eat? This is simply letting him play. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five priests on the side heard this big eyes and looked at Jellos incredulously. A few days ago, they also heard that Geros said that Su Ge is a promising priest and should focus on training. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But today, he actually let his promising department go to drink the potion to die? This is too cold and ruthless! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The honest and upright Anthony couldn’t help himself. He wanted to speak again, but he was stunned by the coldness of Gerlos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the mouth that had been opened, could not be said if it reached the throat. After a few seconds, it was pale and silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss looked at his face and struggled. Su Ge continued: "Handle this matter properly. After two months of internship, I will let you become official." The clergyman, who gets a monthly salary of 40 francs, enters the church establishment, receives systematic training, and can view the Holy Blood Church Library, as well as many training courses such as fighting, shooting, etc."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five priests on the side looked dumbfounded. They had never seen such a naked and fascinating cleric desperately, and they were so bright and bright in front of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is this the master of the church? It is a ruthless profiteer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"咕噜!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Sug’s eyes widened and the heart suddenly accelerated . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reassured, let go, although it will experience some pain, but I can guarantee that you will not die, and will not leave any serious aftereffects, at most Weak for a while." Finally, Gerlos calmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s pinch bottle asks: “Are the other priests still not coming back?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Father Anthony apologized bitterly: "I am sorry, they will not come back until the end of the month."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the departure of the priest allowed the child to bear these sins, Anthony The priest felt a little overwhelmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerlos said: "If you have them, you won't get this huge benefit, and you won't have such an opportunity to let go of your own limits."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear this, Suge pinches the potion and bites his teeth: "Dry!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Su Ge, who had just made up his mind in the morning, decided to fight in the face of such huge interests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Man, it’s time to lick yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After hearing the promise of Sug, the five priests on the side suddenly opened their eyes and looked surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is to drink the potion! Devil's Poison Potion! Father Anthony whispered, "Master Gerlos, you have to calm down. You are against the rules of the church. Sotos is a church officer, if Something went wrong..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jellos said faintly: "Child, I am 101 years old this year, and I have been dealing with the potion for 90 years. I don't have to worry about it for you in this regard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Father Anthony listened to complete silence, at this time he remembered that in today's Church of the Holy Blood, Master Geros is almost the oldest and most qualified group of hunters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Father Anthony turned to look at Su Ge and said with a serious attitude: "Mr. Sotos, the church will remember your pain and suffering. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge said: "Thank you for your approval, Father."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequent Su Ge took a deep breath and looked at Jellos and asked, "Master, how should I drink?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shark potion will greatly stimulate you The spirit and psionic power, you can now release your own psionic power. This way, after drinking the shark potion, you can also fill up the psionic power that was lacking before you ascend." Gerlos said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded and said, "Okay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And, before the potion Drink this first.” Gerlos handed over a transparent bottle with emerald green liquid inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a rejuvenating potion, it has a small amount of toxicity, the main effect is to remove the strengthening effect of all potions, and detoxification, you only need to drink A drop, it can help you offset the toxicity of a part of the shark potion, and will not have much effect on the efficacy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug took the bottle and nodded hard Say: "Understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will look at you all the time, no matter what problems you have, I can guarantee that you are safe and let go." Jeros said, take out the pipe and sit down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony turned to the four priests around him and said, "Go to the outside of the exorcist and the police, disperse the masses, and arrange a spiritual sensor to ensure There are no other things around."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!" The four priests rushed out after listening to the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
