			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you the little god official? It's really the key!" The petite female voice is clear and energetic, like a lively nightingale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge squinted and asked: "Key?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogen explained: " It is now at the end of November and is approaching the end of the year. The three priests in Bain City went to the capital to participate in the selection of the sacred choir. So in the last month, the whole city has no priests. So you are very important. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge heard it, and then quickly caught one of the keywords he had not heard: the choir. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old town’s youth squatted down and looked at the second haha ​​and said, “This dog is very good, and in the future it will become your most loyal partner. ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your compliment, sir." Su Gedao said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young people seem to like Erha very much, but they are restrained and don’t reach out and touch, stand up and say, “The night watchman, Marx Kenneth, very happy. I met you as a good master."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nighting girl smiled and said: "My name is Bobby Perseus. Marx likes dogs most, if You can let him touch, I believe that you will soon become friends."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the smiles of three people, Sug squinted Some are not going back to God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogen said with a smile: "Is there some accidents? Why are those who walk all night at night not as gloomy and indifferent as those vampires?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No! No!" Sug hurriedly shook his head. Marx looked at Erha and said, "People are afraid of us. It is normal. After all, every night we want to move around like a ghost and drive everyone on the street. But we are normal." There is no difference between people, just like a weak patient during the day, they can't act violently."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You want to touch it, it knows humanity, You can feel his love for him." Su Ge saw strong love and longing from Marx's green eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a real dog-loving person! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondary is very lively. After confirming that it is not an enemy, he is very familiar with it and smashes his robe with his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s mouth twitched slightly, and the heart said: “It’s the easiest dog to reach a consensus with criminals. You’re too familiar with yourself.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marx saw this, and immediately opened the flower, took off his gloves and squatted, touched the ridge of the second Hana Guanghua, and continued to admire: "It's so good, it's good!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Su Ge also intends to ask some questions, just listen to Rogan: "The sky is bright, we have to go back to the church to rest. Wait for you to become Official clerics, we have a lot of opportunities to meet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge listened and nodded, he was very good for the three people who were easygoing and cheerful. First impression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marx stood up and took a shot of Suger’s shoulder: “Work hard!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing three people leave in the crisp ringtone, Su Ge said: "The friendliness of the church seems to be much better than I expected."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ha always walked to the edge of the city. Erha saw the white wilderness and was ready to rush out, but was stopped by Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time is now six o'clock, it's time to go back to wash and prepare breakfast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But this is also an opportunity, and in the future, you can go to the collapsed factory in the name of a hyena to see the situation of two people in Hills. Even if you run it every day, it won't cause anyone's doubts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At 8 o'clock in the morning, the well-dressed Sug sat at the desk on the first floor of the police. before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The case of yesterday did not need to follow up on his own, and I was idle today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing is going on, Su Ge took out two books and prepared to study it carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two books are "The Code of the Moon" and "The Detailed Explanation of the Officials' Foundation". The former is an excerpt from the March Book of the Holy Blood, and is similar to the books of the Earth Bible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter is a book that Gerlos gave him about his career, including how the priest should meditate, the benefits of surging souls, his mentality, and some use of psionics. Simple methods and more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shu’s first look is a direct explanation of the "Shenzhen Foundation". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First look at the method of meditation. There is nothing special about the method, which is to let the spirit go through the spirit and enter the state of no self. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The sacred supernatural soul is the core of the sacred officer's ability to enhance his strength. The supernatural soul can gain the grace of the goddess, and can let himself know more about the soul, the faith, and realize the redemption of others. The happiness, thus consolidating the mind and enhancing the spirit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The joy of redeeming others... really comfortable." Su Ge recalled yesterday watching Chuck soul The feeling when leaving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The basic ability of the priest is numerous, but there is hardly any battle-related. The core competencies include soul affinity, meditation, spiritual purification, and psionics. : Shield."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The soul has been used by me, it is to make the soul very close to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The effect of meditation is to inject some verses into their own psionic powers, to free themselves and those around them from some bad attitudes and to restore calm."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The spiritual purification is directly through the psionic energy, not the throat, and the special mysterious sound is formed to purify some curses and monsters."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"The last psionic release: Shield is the use of psionic power to support a simple shield against physical attacks and mysterious creatures,"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; After reading the skills, Su Ge analyzed: "I can see that the priest is a purely auxiliary priestly character, and he has almost no combat power. This is also positive. Auxiliary support staff is relatively safer, in which some of the world's Song can do no wrong "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;</div>
