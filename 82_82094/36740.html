Looking at Chuck, who was lying on the floor, Su Ge was a little embarrassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the cold wind blowing, a gray mist is invisible Under the influence of the sweep, and then wrapped up Chuck's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the mist quickly became materialized and turned into a gray-black metal plate fixed to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire plate is completely covered, helmets, shoulders, breastplates, armbands, armor and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the blink of an eye, the golden soul became a fully armed steel warrior, except for the golden eyes of the wolf head helmet, all of which turned grayish black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Stand up, my warrior." Although he didn't know how this thing came, he didn't hinder his homeopathic force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chuck squeezed the spear in his hand and stood up respectfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "From now on you are responsible for guarding the door of this temple, destroying all enemies." Su Ge's tone is solemn and heavy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chuck listened to the incomparable pleasure, pinching the fist with the armor, slamming his chest and screaming loudly: "I will be Everything that my Lord has given me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the avid Chuck, Su Ge’s mind suddenly thought: “The people’s innermost desire is not the gift from the outside world. Help, but to reflect their own value, that is, to be needed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, when assigning tasks and work to the hands, you can make your hands more Loyal and happy, I seem to have found the trick of this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High rifle, Chuck stood at the door of the temple with a sly pace, motionless A statue is average. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug turned back to the throne and fell into meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Chuck, who was temporarily edited by my prayers, came here. Seeing these prayers is still effective. It is not sending the soul to the so-called heaven and goddess, but to me." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not a bad thing for me. It’s no problem for the warship to come alone. Not to mention there are some benefits."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg looked down at the palm of his hand, and it had a golden brilliance, which was the power of faith contributed by Chuck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of this belief can't be used, but it can be saved, maybe it can be used at other times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The armor on Chuck’s body seems to be the fog outside. Is it that the fog outside is not an environmental factor, but with this Like a warship, is something "I" not?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This space has too much mystery, but there are so few things that Su Ge can explore at this time, many things Only Su Ge can make up his own brain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since others can summon me in the real world through spells and statutes, can I spoof here and call the people of the real world here? What?” Su Ge thought of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no power to summon the real world, summoning believers here, but making it easier for you to force yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, have time to study."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bell on the top of the head rang again, and two confused souls whizzed past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where is this? Why are there so many souls?" Su Ge is like a child with 100,000 reasons, everything is unknown. Everything is novel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body leans on the throne, and Su Ge meditates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He returned to reality when he returned to God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I opened my eyes and looked at it. It was already half past five. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜呜呜...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One side of the second with his head on Su Ge’s legs, some Irritated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, yes. This creature of the dog needs to go out and bend." Su Ge thought of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a restful night, Su Ge’s spirit has fully recovered, even more spiritual and more radiant than yesterday. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open the closet, put on a loose gray overalls and sweater, wear a leather jacket on the upper body, and Su Ge walks out the door with a cane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This cane is not an ordinary cane, and Su Ge will not leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel like I’m going out, and I’m so excited that I’m not excited, jumping and jumping on the floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment the door was opened, the second slammed out and shook his tail down the steps, then rushed to the front yard. In the snow, I rolled hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug will stand up, not to keep out the cold, but to let others see that they are really cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city of Bain at the end of November is not fully lit at five o'clock, groggy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody on the street, Su Ge put his hands in his pocket, the second two in front of him opened his long legs and ran cheerfully, here for a while Smell it, and dig a digging there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, I have to go to a tree root to pull down a big bubble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't run too far!" Su Ge said here, feeling the quiet morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second is not an ordinary dog, very psychic, so he does not care much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;叮叮叮......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After about seven or eight hundred meters, at the intersection of Xiangguo Street and Yujin Street, Su Ge heard a crisp ringtone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the second singer of the singer’s body was stiff, and the scorpion turned and ran back to Su Ge’s side, his face vigilant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge squinted and looked alert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After five seconds, he saw three people on the corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three men wore black robes and black robes on their heads, covering their faces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are signs of the Church of the Holy Blood on their chests, a bell hanging from the chest, a black iron lantern on the left and right, and a dark thorn stick on the right hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three people noticed the second ha, turned and looked up slightly to see Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three very common faces under the hat, that is, the skin is a bit too white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leading is a tall, middle-aged man with a white beard, on the left is a youth in the old town, and on the right is a young woman who is not old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three people walked around, accompanied by crisp ring tones, giving a weird pressure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The sun has not yet fully risen, what are you doing here?" asked the middle-aged man who spoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge touched and said, "Hello dog."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Middle-aged people carefully I looked at Su Ge and then noticed the pendant of the sterling silver goddess outside the Suge sweater. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are a church member?" The middle-aged man had some surprises. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded and took his token from his pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man took a look and smiled at the corner of his mouth and said, "You are the very talented little priest."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
