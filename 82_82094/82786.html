			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The madman, a group of madmen, they killed the captain, they portrayed the weird law, using the captain's blood, they were wearing red clothes, with bone masks, They are the devil. Mother, I am so scared!" The soul hugged Su Ge and whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge asked some other things, but found that the soul is already chaotic, there are not many memories, and no other information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge gently hugged him and whispered, "Don't be afraid, the good goddess of goodness will bless you, and now return to his arms." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, Su Ge once again recited his own original prayer statement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The distant bells came from the fog, and led to the lost soul. The glory of my Lord bloomed in the abyss, breaking through despair and spreading hope. Storm-like warships linger in the fog, expelling terrible monsters, pinning on the glory of my Lord, performing justice, eliminating prejudice, and blessing the people, shining the world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "We are the Lord of the Storm and Death, the only true God of the Valley and the Abyss, the ruler of dreams, the dominator of death, the believer of the fog, the Lord, who will lead the souls of the scorpions to the other side, in the evening clock Enjoy the eternal peace and quiet in the midst."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This indiscriminately fabricated prayer is very effective. After the reading, the soul has already radiated golden brilliance. go with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the golden glow of the spread, the grievances on the boat dissipated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the distance, Anthony looked up and walked to the next corpse of Su Ge. He was surprised and asked: "Master, you are sure that he is just a priest." Ten days of apprenticeship? This kind of prayer and purification is faster than the old gods in our church!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss said with a faint sigh "I said, he is very talented."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After purifying the third person, Su Ge sat on the ground, his face pale, and his forehead oozing Fine sweat, full of Venus in front of me, and some tinnitus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss walked over and said, "Drink!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Sug’s eyes blinked, he took a drop of the potion and carefully poured it into his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This potion has no taste, it is a bit of bitterness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After swallowing the potion, Gerlos said: "You can continue."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge took out the shark potion in the blue-gray bottle and took a deep breath and drank it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This shark potion has a weird aroma, the aroma can not be described, there is no hot feeling after swallowing, but the mouth is fragrant, very comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems..." When Su Ge was ready to say that there was no effect, he suddenly felt his head screaming and instantly exploded! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The violent pain allowed Sug to scream out, and he could see a gray-black color in the blood vessels at the neck and chin of Suger. Very scary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The side of Anthony saw this hurriedly put his hands on his forehead and prayed professionally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss crouched down and reached out and touched Sug’s neck and nodded and said, “The body is not bad, barely able to withstand it.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here, Su Ge feels that his body is going to be torn, just like countless sharks appear in his stomach, then tearing his stomach away , along the blood vessels of his body constantly raging. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horrible pain caused Su Ge to suffocate for a while, and tears could not help but linger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Breathing, trying to breathe, don't think about anything else." Gerlos came from a distant blurring voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug is like a last-minute rescue of straw, and strives to comply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took in the past, when Su Ge felt painful and retreated, he suddenly opened his eyes. At this time, he felt stronger than ever! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there is still a lot of pain and discomfort in the body, compared with this powerful state, those pains are not worth mentioning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Slowly standing up, Su Ge feels that his mental power has entered a new realm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How long have I been in a coma?" Su Ge asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss said casually: "40 seconds."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, then I continue !! Su Ge, who feels like a superman, continues his investigation and super-degree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is not much progress in intelligence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After an hour, after the thirteenth crew of Su Ge overtook, the information obtained was very simple. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The group of people took a small black vessel and plundered the property after the raid, and began to slaughter the crew to perform some evil rituals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the ceremonial summoned, what is happening is unknown. The most impressive thing for everyone is the red robe, the bone mask, and the short knife in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vomiting and vomiting......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge will simply say the situation, kneeling by the boat Start vomiting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are two main reasons for vomiting, the tragic inhuman scene, and the side effects of potions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jeros heard this and said directly: "It should be the twin leagues on the plateau."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Gemini League?" Su Ge asked with curiosity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony explained: "The Twin Alliance has a long history of cult organizations and is the eighth cult organization in the world. They originate from the barren plateau, and the main believers are Plateau people, the object of faith is the evil spirit known as the black blood Gemini. They advocate blood, and they are used to catching people back to release the blood sacrifice to their gods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;When I heard this, Sugton was a little chilling, and then the stomach began to rush again, turning around and continuing to vomit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland on the platform is concerned: "Is it all right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack Shaking his head and said: "I don't know, but have you discovered that through the prayers of Su Ge, the feeling of gloomyness on the whole ship seems to have dissipated."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland listens After a careful feeling, I accidentally said, "Don't say it, it really feels like this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The little god official is purifying the soul of the ship, along with The grievance is reduced, and the sinister atmosphere is naturally reduced." On the side, wearing a mask, holding a pair of knives, an exorcist with a close armor, said with a trace of admiration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland listened to the temptation: "Is Su Ge doing something terrific?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The nun listened to the sinking, then nodded and said: "In terms of his current strength, it is indeed a very remarkable thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In three people When I talked about it, I suddenly felt a very bad yin blowing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the nun’s chest of the nun’s chest began to tremble violently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time trembling, there are other nuns' pendants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not good!" The nun immediately stopped Jack and Roland behind him and shouted: "All the police! Leave quickly! Fast!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嘎嘣! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice has just fallen, and a mast on the ship is suddenly crushed by invisible power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other side, Su Ge on the boat felt cold and chilling behind him, and the sensory pendant on his chest could not be shaken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wiped his mouth and slammed his head and found nothing to see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗖嗖嗖! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
