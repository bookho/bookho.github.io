			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big bloody moon filled the night sky, and the huge moon seemed to fall from the sky and slammed into the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bloody red moonlight is like a layer of bloody tulle covering everything in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s eyes stared at the blood-red moonlight in the sky, only to find that there was no special feeling besides feeling that the moonlight was very strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no special changes to those who turn around and look around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even Luke, who was once severely beastified, is not unusual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A moment of silence, Su Ge said in an instant: "It turns out that because of the reason of the law, the special moonlight of the blood moon has been invalidated here." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look!" Bernice said suddenly in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people looked up and saw that the dark circle of the day turned into a bright red like blood in the bloody red moonlight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When this blood red reaches a certain level, the countless runes above start to rotate at high speed, just like the engine that runs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Our protagonist has appeared." Luke pointed to the sky and said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Luke’s fingers, Bishop Ron was wearing a gorgeous black gold robe at this time, and the whole person floated in the air, the magic book in his hand. The giant worm worm song is rapidly flipping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Slowly opening his arms, Ron’s eyes suddenly fired a reddish glow on the array of the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a loud voice spread throughout the city: "Children, offer sacrifices for our mother!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; booming...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, everyone felt the ground under the feet suddenly violently shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along with the cracks on the ground, countless huge worms rushed out from under the ground and looked at at least a few hundred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They gradually contracted their bodies and became ten meters in size, walking through the city to destroy people's houses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啊啊啊啊......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a scream of screams, hiding in The citizens in the room witnessed their appearance and instantly fell into a frenzy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in five minutes, the maddening citizens skyrocketed ten times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tens of thousands of mad citizens were invisibly attracted and gradually moved closer to the Basilica of the Holy Blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This madman!" Even if the inner mature and stable Aidelin saw such a mass slaughter, she could not bear it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hills and Bernice are fine, they are just standing quietly beside Su Ge, seemingly waiting for something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge stared at Ron in the air and strolled forward and said, "Help me open the way, I am going to talk to him."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This can't be done!" A sharp dagger suddenly appeared behind Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luke’s hand waved a moment, and a blood flashed over to beat the dagger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ron said it was really good, there are indeed high people around you." With the sound of Clausen, there were also five Ghoul and the mystery of six cold-shoulder churches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Adeline, your last performance made me very disappointed." Claude spoke to Adeline. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aideline sneered: "I have never promised you anything, not to mention that I have not shot anyone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Claude sighed his forehead: "Sure enough, the Archbishop said yes, the female warlock is really embarrassed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Su Ge took a step forward and lifted his chin slightly. He said faintly: "Let it open."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Claude looked at Su Ge and smiled: " I see that you are not ordinary, just as Ron needs some toys in the process of waiting for him to pass. We just need to block this bloody guy."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luke listened to his grin and smiled, his bloody moonlight looked like his gray face was very embarrassing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My blood for the undead has been coveted for a long time, I hope your blood has enough coagulation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Claude is not willing to pick up his own decapitation: "I see you still be careful behind your back, our backstab of the undead is the existence of countless kings." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The damn sun knight, damn backstab, you insult the word the sun." Learned Bernice thought of the books he had seen, those The self-proclaimed Sun Knight always likes to sneak a sneak attack on the backstab, and the heroes in countless stories are degraded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Claude spread his face innocently: "That is the habit of their sun knight, it has nothing to do with me. I like the moon, I prefer the bright back." Thorn!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, the body disappears instantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哼! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luke snorted and his body moved, and Claude’s body suddenly withdrew from the shadows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, he was bleeding and looked very scary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Like the moon, is it a bloody person who came out of the maze of blood, can I break my curse of my immortality and let me bleed?" Claude Wiping the blood on his face, his posture is a little dignified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luke grinned: "Reassure, this is just beginning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other side, I only heard a loud drink from Vegginia: "Super Invincible Glorious Pursuit of the Holy Sword!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shouting, the giant sword that was almost as big as her body suddenly glared, and then slammed forward, and actually shot a sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dodge!" Several ghouls are physically flexible and ready to break into the shadows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sanitary Glory Sanctions Hammer!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name is very long, very medium, but the effect is unfolding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swords are just smashing, and when the ghouls are dodging, Vegniya’s body suddenly rushes to the side of a ghoul, and the sword is held high. Under the armpit, a pool of meat mud appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Abyssal Dragons! Help me! There is also the master of steel control, the Holy Grail of the Glorious Goddess needs your help!" Vigini Ya attacked and yelled at Hills and Bernice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two witches are twitching constantly by the eyes of Vegginia, but they are still directly attacking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hills is taking a purely physical attack. She completely violates the rules of the mysterious duel that Barton said at the time, and does not say anything, rushing up regardless of the three seven two Eleven, tearing off the enemy's head is a victory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this time it’s not a coincidence that there are three mysterious people on the opposite side, three of which are physically known. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other side, the obese middle-aged among the mysterious people said to Adeline slightly: "Please rest assured that the lady will show me for a while." After enjoying your body, I will give you a happy death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aideline’s charming smile said: “Is it? But I am worried about your body. Oh."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After talking, a series of ice guns have been shot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When fighting here, Suge progressed quietly, by his side Thousands of mad people are walking with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
