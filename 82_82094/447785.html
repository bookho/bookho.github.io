			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg couldn’t help but smile: "Where did she know so much about me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aida mysterious smile: "You will know later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge did not ask deeply, and asked: "I heard Something about you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ada looked up slightly and looked at Su Ge. "You should be very clear. Sometimes, death is a gift. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge silently, then a smile on his mouth, no words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last time I was in a hurry, this time I met by chance, the two did not say too much, just like in the past, when the two looked at each other Occasionally, I talked about some interesting things I encountered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two people who are together are sitting on the edge of the cliff...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time has passed, Aida is happy to stand up lightly. She stands out from the air, standing in the air, like a fairy fairy, temperament is refined, her spirits are flying, her mouth is smiling and smiling: "I can see you, make me very happy, very happy."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The breeze blows over, the robes and the long hairs fly, and the black and white are like the yin and yang with each other, simple and dusty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger said with pleasure: "Will you stay here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" No, the people of the Glorious Church are a little annoyed, and they are constantly killing." Ada sighs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge stood up and patted the dust on his ass: "What help do I need?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Take care of the witches, they are really pitiful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded: "No problem."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So kind-hearted little guy, we will see you later." Ada’s sinful smile smacked at Su Ge and his body disappeared instantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not deeply gazing, no reluctance, no deep mutual support, like the same as once, after talking about Ada's body disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But unlike the last time, Su Ge was not Su Ge at that time. He was not guilty and confused, but full of happiness and joy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Ada left, Suge looked around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the north, he saw a dark swamp, which was like ink and dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not far from the edge of the swamp, a hilly area thundered and thundered, and the horrible storm gradually condensed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And between the two, a W-shaped quirky mountain range is endless, the youth green water above, the clouds haunt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this, Su Ge suddenly felt a little familiar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And looked at the dark swamp and the storm hills Su Ge suddenly thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The original place, the place is indeed in the north. Just in the middle of the night and the storm plateau." Su Ge eyes are shining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, a burst of light flashed, and Su Ge suddenly felt that the whole world was in a collapse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, Sug rubbed his eyes, looked at the rags lying on the table, and the books on his hands were a bit sullen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The twisted lines on the first page of the book began to wriggle, and then produced a lot of black matter like ink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These substances gradually spread, gradually swallowed the entire book, and finally disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collecting his current thoughts, Sug turned his head and looked at the time, it was seven o'clock in the evening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge leaned on the chair and imagined Ada’s perfect look at this time, and his heart became more and more happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sure enough, my family Ada knows me the most." Su Ge's mouth could not help but reveal a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nowadays the whole world, Ada is the first to know that he is a god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he also thoroughly understands what kind of existence Ada is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Holy Grail of the Soul, I am bound to get it." Sug stretched out his hand and pressed against the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At dinner, Su Ge called Jean, who had recovered and recovered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looked at Jean and didn’t seem to have much influence. He asked, “What did you see at the time?”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jean brows tightly and contemplates for a moment: "I saw a huge black shadow and stunned me. The dark shadow in the vagueness said that you are lucky."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug's chewed beef nodded slightly and waved at Jean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jean respectfully came forward, and Su Ge whispered in his ear: "You are back to Guinness now, tell Vanas to say......... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Listening to what Su Ge said, Jean's eyes gradually widened and he was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listening, Jin En looked at Su Ge incredibly: "Bishop, is this... really going to this step?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug did not answer and waved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jean stood in the place and thought for five minutes before reluctantly digesting the shocking news, then his face was solemn: "I Immediately depart."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, turned and ran out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After dinner, Su Ge entered the world of dreams after meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Chuck, called Hills and Randall," Su Ge said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chuck nodded as soon as he heard it, and took another knight to roll over the giant wolf, leaving with a gust of wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The place of night, in a quaint castle on the north side of Shuguang City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master, it’s time to eat." On the luxurious table, the servant wearing the deacon dress came over, but the golden plate was not the bread, but the bread. It is a large glass of bright red blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wearing a white shirt in front of the table, the skin is white and looks like a handsome and elegant Randall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Randall picked up the cup and said faintly: "This kind of thing can help me to continue my life, but they are also gradually pushing us into the edge of madness." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged deacon on the side whispered: "Please don't say this, the Hearst family needs your support."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Randall shook his glass and said: "I just dealt with one of my Yi people the day before yesterday. He went crazy because he had too much blood and killed his sister." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man is silent: "Your willpower is the most powerful one I have ever seen. The backbone and pride of your Koster family."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Randall stood up and put down the glass and said, "I don't feel that this is a kind of pride. I have found my faith, He can take us. Freed from this bloody curse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you still think this is a curse, not a gift?" Pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Randall looked at the quiet moon outside and said calmly: "I have not slept for three hundred years. Every time I sleep, those filthy things will be found. On me, I am eager to get a real sleep."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man is not talking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Get it, I don't want to be a beast so fast." Randall said, the tone was full of exhaustion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man slowly squeezed his fists. It seemed to have made some determination and asked: "Master, forgive rude, you have joined the church." More than a year. You risked the witch, educated her, and even used the best resources to grow her. You also led the people to the Guinness Kingdom in one sentence, so badly hurt. You have paid enough price. However, your Lord still has no representation. Such a Lord, are you sure that He will save you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Randall was silent and didn't speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man handed over the cup: "Your blood has been consumed a lot, and if you don't eat it, your body will experience a decline."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Randall looked down at the cup and his eyes were full of struggles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called high vampires of their group are not as invincible as the outside, they also have weaknesses, and they also have vulnerabilities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability to heal is not endless, and all higher vampires must replenish their blood regularly to maintain their form without degradation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the blood is deficient, they will not die, but the body will degenerate and weaken. It is even possible to degenerate into a lower vampire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because... there are no natural vampires, they are high vampires because they hold the bloody holy pool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the silence, Randall still did not go to drink the glass of blood, it seems to be inductive, the body instantly turned into a black mist, disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge sat on the throne, watching the storm in front of himself, and the ideas in his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Abyssal Walker, Glen Guard, Miggy Knight, Nightmare Warlock..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In front of the storm hunting like a badge, there is a rapid formation of the internal structure of the church in the late bell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The bell is really small."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking for a moment, Sug collects the storm Hunting and going down the throne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every step, the breath narrows by one point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When walking down the steps to the flat, it has become the human appearance of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the temple, Hills and Randall have arrived, respectfully standing outside the temple, devotional and motionless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge walked out of the temple at this time and smiled at the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two hurriedly bowed to each other and were respectful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge looked at the situation of the two, and Hills is still very lively. But Randall’s mental state is very bad, and it can even be said to be somewhat morbid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thirstyemia?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Randall nodded bitterly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge patted his shoulder: "Randall, your persistence and loyalty are very satisfied, your contribution, your merits are enough for you Get the gift of the Lord, come with me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that, Suge turned to the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Randall listened to his heart and his eyes gradually widened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hills is very happy and excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Randall is her teacher, she is very aware of the teacher's difficulties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, the teacher has finally arrived at this step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knights outside the temple said in unison: "Randall, congratulations."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Randall felt that the body could not control the trembling. The experience of hundreds of years could not make his spirit as calm as ever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thick bell rang and Randall’s excited heart gradually calmed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In silence, the door of the temple was pushed away by Su Ge and turned and said, "Come on, the Lord's people, you are eligible to enter the temple." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Randall’s heartbeat, the brain was blank for a moment, and only instinctively followed the mechanical steps to follow Su Ge into the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
