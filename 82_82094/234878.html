			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas has not dreamed for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After her kingdom is in turmoil, she can only sleep for two hours a day, and these two hours must be deep sleep that cannot be dreamed, otherwise her The spirit cannot maintain the high-intensity work of the remaining twenty-two hours. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, on the night of the Blood Festival, she felt that she had made a very real dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dream she passed through a lot of fog and came to a dilapidated ice warship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dream is so real, even let her think that all this is true. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not a good sign." For such a real dream, she is very heavy, because it means that her sleep quality has a problem, this is her The sign that the spirit is about to collapse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she hadn’t returned to God, she suddenly found two rows of soldiers wearing armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These soldiers have a powerful momentum that makes her fear, the kind of oppression is unparalleled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is how good my soldiers should be." Vanas instinctively thought of his troubled country, and his heart was getting tired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stupid woman! You dare to rush into the battleship of my Lord! Letting you die 10,000 times can't cleanse your offense and sin! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incomparably angry voices were sent out from the mask of the soldiers, and then the soldiers immediately raised their spears and stabbed Vanas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Vanas felt a very strong death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This taste is very horrible and familiar, because she has been wandering in this taste for more than half a year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is not a mystery, but has a special talent, that is, smelling the death of different people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, she smelled a new taste... this is the smell of her own death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not a dream!" Suddenly, Vanas thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she reacted too late, the rifle had fallen, it was close at hand and could not be reversed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am so dead?" Vanas stunned her own scarlet eyes and began to struggle fiercely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plain and majestic voice does not know where it came from. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas eyes wide open, looking at the sharp gunpoints that have touched their eyelashes but are steadily stopping, and the whole body is unable to move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take her over." The voice came again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;唰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dozen or so long guns were retracted in an instant, and then the stiff Vanas was framed by two female warriors and walked to the edge of the ship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty!" Two female warriors shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas instinctively, kneeling down on his noble knees, staring at the majestic back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, all her spirits are filled with this majestic back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How can there be such a majestic and perfect existence in this world?" She thought instinctively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure turned slightly, the eyes under the silver-gray mask swept over Vanas, and the plain and majestic voice came from under the mask: "Woman, where are you from?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas heard this inquiry, and suddenly there was an indescribable gratitude and happiness in his heart, as if raising his hands many times. Finally, the child who got the teacher's attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tears fell silently from the corner of his eyes, and Vanas said on the ground: "I am from the Principality of Gilles, I am the new queen of the Principality of Gilles, Vanas Gilles."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, the person seems to know something, watching the blizzards around, though it is dull, but it makes people feel very excited and surging words: "Exit."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only two words, just incomparably plain tone, but do not know why Wannas is listening to the tide, can not wait to wear armor to follow him and fight together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stunned Su Ge spirit returned to the battleship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sitting on the throne, Su Ge’s eyes closed and he felt deeply immersed in deep contemplation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just now, he witnessed the deaths of tens of thousands of people, witnessed the approximation of the end, witnessed the fragility of life, and witnessed what is truly crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of vision makes him feel very bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this experience has also added some inexplicable calmness and indifference to his spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it numb? Or adapt?" Su Ge's heart is very complicated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Forget it, don't want this problem, now it's time to think about it, to punish the ant ant." Thoughts think of this, Su Ge's spirit is completely cold . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking down the throne, Su Ge began to think about how he should act next. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "According to the rules of the normal world, I am unable to enter the material world, can only wander in this illusory dream world. But now the general rules of the entire Bain city The system has completely collapsed. In theory, I can come to that place, but how to come, but some can't find a clue."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! Boom! Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the night clock on the head suddenly remembered a series of thick bells, and Sugg looked up and suddenly found a large number of souls passing through the big clock and then disappeared. not see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of these souls is very large, and there are tens of thousands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge walked out of the temple in the meditation of watching the night bell, standing on the edge of the battleship and pondering the connection between these souls and their own coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind, Chuck 再次 once again said on the ground: "The undead have paved the way for you to step into the mortal world, and countless deaths and skeletons cast the altar. My lord, your throne has been built, please give it to the world to purify, please give this soul for redemption, please give this ugly sanction."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similar Chuck has said the second time, the first time was about a few months ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚咚咚...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More souls in the sky pass through the big clock and disappear . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge felt that he had caught the clue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he felt his spirit and someone had a resounding emotional resonance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then in his perception, a soul full of sadness and anxiety appeared on the battleship, officially Vanas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a simple inquiry, Su Ge wanted to understand a lot of things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It turns out that we finally know what kind of existence we are, and finally know our mission!" Su Ge had a lot of things at the same time, even knew What kind of existence is it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The last time Chuck said this, he also had a large number of souls of death, and that was the most serious time for Gilles’ domestic fight. This time, there are so many souls again, and Chuck speaks again. This shows that as long as there is a lot of war and death in the world, we can use this as an opportunity to come."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Incorporating this battleship, this ghost wolf, this hoarfrost and armor soldier, then the true identity of this battleship has come to the fore."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Call...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
