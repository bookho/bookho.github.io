			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge heard some thoughts in his heart and said directly: "If nothing else, it should be a human face rat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Human face rat? What?" Elena has never heard of this Yi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger explained: "The human face rats belong to the lower-level Yi people. They generally have a slightly smaller body than monkeys. They are extremely flexible and have claws similar to human hands. The shape is no different from the larger ones. But they will have human faces. Ordinary mice act as rodent animals, their noses and mouths protrude outwards, presenting a special three-dimensional triangle, and you just said that the mouse's face is round. That, it is very likely that it has a face."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speaking of this, Elena suddenly thought: "Yes! When it rushed out, I The fuzzy sees that its face is much flatter than the normal mouse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded: "In addition, the ordinary person can't see it, he is in Within the system of the vision, no accident is the human face."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there something in the Yi? I don’t have any impression." A mysterious person with deep qualifications, remember that the Dai people's information is the basic quality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But there is no record of such things in her mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s heart said: “You certainly can’t find it. This is the source setting I saw on Earth!”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This kind of thing I saw inadvertently in some ancient books, you don't know it is normal here." Suge explained, but also showed that he has a rich reading. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a pity that Elena’s attention at this time is not on this, and she hurriedly asked: “What is the power of this kind of thing? How much can see it? To?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh... I am not very clear about this, I didn't say it in the ancient books." Su Ge answered a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illina snorted and turned to look at the operating room next to him: "The assassin's surgery is still going on, I can't live without it. You are fast To inform the master of the news, let him think about the countermeasures. If possible, dispose of that thing as soon as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge nodded: "It’s just that Master Mill has something to look for. I am going now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, take Hills quickly to leave here and head to Mill Master's mysterious workshop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Pope, this demon hunter gives me the same feeling as other people. I don't feel the horrible oppression on his body." And the feeling of disgust," Hills whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg heard some accidents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under normal circumstances, the demon hunter and the witch are almost natural enemies. Even if it is not the demon hunter of the Church of the Holy Blood, most of them are mainly hunting witches, so each witch is very afraid of the demon hunter, and seeing it will produce a fear of instinct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, now that Hills has actually said this, it makes the Su Ge idea flexible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this because Hills got the reason for the storm hunting? Or is it because of Mill’s own recovery of feelings? It should be more reliable to restore feelings, because Iraq Lena and his relationship seem to be good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people came to Mill's magic workshop in contemplation, and when they came in, they heard a horrible horrible call. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug knows that another poor worm has lost his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mill is not at the scene of the experiment, at this time he is wearing a casual vest and shorts, wearing a white coat outside, the overall look is not at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are coming soon!" Mill turned and grinned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge went to the front and gave a slight salute, then said with a serious face: "Master Mill, I just discovered a very rare Yi, a human face..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to Su Ge, Mill touched his chin: "The human face rat is really being said by you. This is not the case in today’s Dai literature. The Yi people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge dignified: "Is there really a lot of Yi people not found?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course, the Yi people themselves are very distorted and various in form. Their forms almost violate the normal life form, and we have no way to analyze how they are produced and how they evolved." Mill's face with a hint of helplessness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this Su Ge’s heart: "From the current situation, many of the Yi people in the original setting have not been discovered, I thought It’s my authority is not enough.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge has seen some information about the Yi people before, but there are not many Yi people recorded in it, and the Yi people who appeared in the original book probably There are about half of them, more of them are monsters and monsters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, there are also the Yi people that Su Ge did not see in the original. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;such as the three-handed stone man, the gray beast, the Lokia flying insects and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mill voice came again: "What is the name of the ancient book you saw? Is there any details of this thing inside?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge shook his head: "The name is no longer visible. I don't know the specific ability and the need for it. But according to the introduction, the birth of this Yi is more weird. It is not created by the gods under the abyss, but by a distorted change. It is said that almost every face rat is a dead cult mad believer who has changed and The owner is loyal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mill listened to it suddenly: "It turns out that it is no wonder that it can not disturb my defense network, it is physically There is no astrological atmosphere."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, although this kind of thing belongs to the Dai, it is very likely to be born in the world, so it does not carry the atmosphere of the stars. Su Ge said affirmatively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rumored abyss is the link between the astral and the present world, and the Yi people who climbed from the abyss, such as the world, came from the astral world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, they all carry a breath that is incompatible with the world. This breath is the atmosphere of the stars and an important mysterious material. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The dead cult mad believer... It seems that the information that the assassin arrived here has been leaked out." Mill severely flashed a chill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
