			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a dead silence, the people returned to God for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In quiet, you can only hear the sound of a few people drinking, and the friction of the bartender wiping the cup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Abyss Black Dragon Lord threw the crumpled head on the ground and said to the bartender: "Sorry, I will pay for the cleaning costs."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bartender said with a smile: "You don't have to bother with the two, please sit down. We still owe Mr. Sotos several services, and the little things like cleaning are natural." Next."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, a couple of waiters dressed in white shirts and black vests came out in the shadows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only see these people faceless, came to the side of the body, first sprinkled some weird powder, after a few words, the body quickly dissolved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the dissolution process, several people took a lot of cotton-like things from the box and threw them on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a moment, the body is completely dissolved into blood, and the blood is completely absorbed by those cotton, not only does not leave any trace on the floor, even the bloody smell in the air They were absorbed by them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several waiters picked up the cotton and turned them around for two people and turned away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole process was completely unscrupulous, sitting on the side, pale, the four companions of the cult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Long time no see." Two people sitting next to Lance, the abyss of the Black Dragon Lord smiled and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your towel." The waiter handed over the towel and wiped the blood left on her hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lance laughed: "The speed of both of you is really fast. You just started yesterday from the night, so come over so soon." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two very sultry women are naturally the dragon witches and the second women who rushed over from the night. Knight Vegnia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vegginia said casually: "Small meaning, if it is not in the middle of Guinness, it is estimated that it can come faster."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the time, the two people would naturally not say that they came from the windmill of the first ancestor vampire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When flying in the air, two people were frozen enough to lick their noses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The petite woman who has been bowing down for a while has poured two glasses of wine and handed it to two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two people in the body who have not yet dispersed are suddenly treasured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the name is still there, after two people thank you, take half of the mask and drink the hot wine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good wine!" The wine was underwater, and the two people who felt hot were applauding at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time the other talents in the pub were able to return to God, watching the two mysterious people, eyes full of vigilance and awe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moore turned around and asked: "The bishop of the fog, what purpose do you come over this time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a friendly organization that has always been in contact, Moore knows more about the structure of the Church of the Late Bells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This powerful presence is actually just a bishop!?" Hearing Moore's name, everyone is a hop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hills turned slightly: "It turned out to be Captain Moore, you have a lot of things, I just didn't recognize it."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of chilling gave Moore's face, and at the same time concealed the embarrassment that he had not seen at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moore smiled very well with a smile: "Haha, I won the prize. After witnessing the lineup of your church, I am just a small idea."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hills stood up, and the strange scarlet mullion looked around for a circle and said faintly: "The purpose of our two people here is very simple. The people who serve the great storm and the Lord of death, the only true God of the valley and the abyss, want to spread hope and dawn. The reason why you can sit here is because the clock people hope that you can come here and witness the new era. Come here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you mean by this? It seems that we can't come without the consent of him!" The people of Longyan believers said something uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Virginia explained slightly: "You can think about it carefully. At a critical moment, you get the key information by chance. So come here, are some of them too coincidental?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, all the mysteries present were slightly changed, obviously Vegginy This sentence of Ya said their heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The reason why you can get the news is that the clock is willing to let you get the news. If the clock is not willing, even if the matter is over, you still Nothing is known, just like what happened in the ancient city of Asia."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear this, everyone can't speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, people don’t know what happened to the ancient city. Why does the Church of the Holy Blood still have to do such a rigorous ban on that matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hiss went on to say, "The task of our two is very simple, just drink here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Vignia added: "By the way, some guys who don't know how to be thick and restless are killed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pump! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear this, everyone’s heart suddenly jumps and glances at each other, and they all see the surprise and faint tension in the other’s eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha! Look at you to be like that!" Vegniya laughed haha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Our evening church is different from the March church. As long as you know what you are, don't take the initiative to provoke us. I am very willing to live in peace with many organizations." /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are people who face each other at this time, the flip of the previous one is too big, so that they do not know what kind of expression to put on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咻咻咻......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I spoke, there was a special sound outside the pub that only mysterious people could hear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishop of the glorious church sneered: "The Church of the Holy Blood has angered and blew the night patrol, and there will be a horrible massacre this evening." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Night Watch is one of the advanced bans of the Church of the Holy Blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This command represents the armed forces that have mobilized all the Church of the Holy Blood to blood wash all the enemies in the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No mercy, no captives, no living, leaving only blood and bodies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, any non-church mysterious person standing on the street will not be spared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishop turned his head and said, "I wish you good luck."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lance At this point, I was worried about looking at two people with an inquiry in my eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selena has already come together, bowing her head and whispering something in the ears of the two girls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But from the expression, she also knows that she is full of worry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, the night patrol has been unused for almost 30 years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last use destroyed a new religion with many believers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That time, the city’s blood flowed into the river, and nearly 10,000 people died before and after. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two of Sears were a bit stunned, and Selena on the side explained that the two men felt the innocence and sinisterness of the Church of the Holy Blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This whistle can be selectively made available to some people and excludes some people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the whistle blows, the person who hears the sound will hide at home, and the person who can't hear will continue to move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, the prisoners of the Church of the Holy Blood will kill all the people who are still active and carry out blood washing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moore turned to ask: "Is there a problem?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hills listened to confidence Ten-way: "Reassured, no problem!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, with the passage of the night patrol, the entire Church of the Holy Blood was dispatched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. March, the guardian of the Holy Blood Maze, the madness of the patrol performer, and the group of hunters who have no feelings and only know the killing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerlos, who replaced the archbishop’s robes, put on a battle suit that he hadn’t worn for a long time, and when he was ready, he walked out of his bedroom to the front of the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a whole hundred hunting hunters standing here, and these hunters are half of the entire city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of these feelingless killing machines, only the same killing machine, and the church trustworthy Jeros can control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, they don’t know that these hunters without any feelings are no longer the hunters of the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Today! We will carry out our justice and usher in a new dawn for this world. I hope that from then on, we will not give up our feelings because of fear, because of fear. And got into madness," Gerlos whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many hunters have folded their hands and prayed, looking exactly the same as other clergy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Archbishop Byron, the elders need your team to completely encircle the entire blade street, do not let any cultist pass!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerousus calmly nodded: "Yes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, turned and led a group of hunters The devil, took the cold and chill to the streets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for why the Church of the Holy Blood suddenly screamed such a terrible ban? Let's push the time forward for five minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of the house of Bernice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two groups did not make much progress against the two groups. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three people of Su Ge could not get out. These people feared the Holy Grail and did not dare to attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Laurie said: "This is our territory, everything belongs to us. You certainly have the gift of God, but after all, you are an ordinary person, you need Drinking water to eat and sleep. Now you are alone, I see when you can hold on!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hearing this, suddenly grinned: "How do you judge me? "There are no ones?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to everyone, Su Ge continued: "Do you really think that you control everything in this city?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the fall of the voice...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! Boom! Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of a heavy bell does not know where it came from, and gradually spread in the dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thick bells radiate from everyone's ear with eccentric ripples, seemingly swearing their existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug slightly spread his arms: "Able to the filth of justice, have you heard the voice of the night? He is calling you." The name."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bell is still coming out, and unconsciously, there has been a strong fog around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gathering the formation, be careful!" Laurie screamed, and the formation of the entire church began to gather quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whistling...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of flapping wings is coming from the fog, Through the psionic induction, the people of the church suddenly discovered that there were a lot of mysterious units around the empty space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These mysterious fluctuations are very strong, each with at least an expert level of strength, at least a hundred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time there are at least six mysterious units of masters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hundreds of expert mysteries, six master mysteries, such a horrible power, can be called horror anywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, expert mystery is not Chinese cabbage! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hui Yaocheng, it hasn't come for a long time." There was a vigorous and powerful voice in the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dispelling the fog!" Laurie said immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, the lord-level archbishop who had never spoken suddenly slammed his arms, and then there was a surge of squally winds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the blink of an eye, the fog around has been completely dispelled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this is not an ordinary fog after all, his wind only dispels the fog of about 200 meters in diameter, and in the distance, the fog still exists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My God!!!!" When the fog disappeared, several clergymen suddenly looked pale after seeing the surrounding conditions. On the ground, the incomparable wolverine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three archbishops saw this scene, and their faces became extremely dignified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time all clergy found that they were surrounded, and there was no ordinary person surrounded by them, all of them are non-human monsters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a total of about 200 enemies, each with at least expert-level terrorist power, and the actual number is twice as much as they perceive! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, there are a hundred vampires in the sky with wings and a strange smell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vampires have their wings on their backs, wearing the uniforms of the church of the late bell, looking strong, elegant, cold, deadly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As opposed to vampires, there are a hundred large werewolves standing on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These werewolves were also dressed in the uniforms of the church in the late bell. The gray hair of the whole body was as bright as metal, and it was a little funny to wear a slightly smaller dress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this kind of funny is dispensable in their horrible mysterious fluctuations and under the shackles of the wolf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside Suge, there are two more people at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the two people stood next to Su Ge, and they were full of respect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a handsome and handsome young man on the left. He is still dressed in the uniform of the church in the late bell. The clothes have a foggy ripple, which represents his unusual identity. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jean Guinness!" Seeing the youth, Laurie's eyes tightened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He used to pass the Guinness Kingdom and had contact with this courteous and ruling prince, although at the time to control Vanas, the evaluation of this prince did Not low. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jean respectfully said: "The evening church, the fog bishop, Jean Guinness, meets the clockman."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mist Bishop!" When he heard this, Laurie suddenly felt a suffocation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, another woman’s voice came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Church of the Night, the Bishop of the Mist, Michelle Hurst, sees the clockman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Michelle is one of the Yi people who transformed after Harr came out of the mountain. He was an expert fighter in his life and has now become a master vampire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, two people each led their own troops, the Vampire Legion and the Werewolves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly and smiled and said: "It’s the time when I was just said to be a lonely man, some uncomfortable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lori's face is gloomy, clenching his teeth and asking: "You crazy! When did you control the entire Guinness!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
