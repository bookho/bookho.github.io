			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your look looks good today, Sotos priest." Father Anthony showed a warm smile after seeing Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days ago, this little priest could help him a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge said slightly: "You look extra handsome today, I can see the glory of the goddess on your body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hahaha! How about Ivan? I said, this is a very flattering courtesy gentleman." Father Anthony smiled and turned his head to the side. The companion said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge turned his head and saw that this person named Ivan was also a priest's costume, but there was no priest Anthony's shawl and golden lightning embroidered edge. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a little short, with a matted hair similar to Jack, but his chin's beard is very clean, he looks about thirty years old. There is a large frame of glasses on the nose, which looks very quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivan’s character seems to be somewhat introverted. After he nodded slightly to Su Ge, he first bowed to the priest Hank next to Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Anthony also turned his head and respected the salute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hank nodded slightly: "How come time is here today?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivan Handed over a handwritten book and explained: "We are here to visit 3-12."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hank took the handbook and looked at it and whispered "Who is this mean?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivan explained: "I applied to the bishop myself. I want to try to communicate with him and see if I can't get some questions about the striker from his mouth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hank is silent, then says: "Be prepared, go!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the people on both sides did not say much, and bid farewell to each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two men walked silent for ten seconds and followed the stone road to a large park with a prototype flower bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The park has four winding roads, the other three leading to the other three stone arches, one leading to a gray chapel and the other leading to a small square, and finally That leads to the magnificent cathedral. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge stopped the bench at this time, and he was a little tired after a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you really want to know what we mean just now?" Hank asked Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge smiled a little embarrassedly: "I don't know if it's impossible, but I still know how to measure. Some things need me to know, I naturally know." I don’t need to know, I won’t ask.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hank’s face with a touch of thumb, his hands in his pocket and said: “Well, wait. After you become a formal clergyman, you will know, don't think too much now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After mentioning "3-12", the topic suddenly became heavy Quite a lot, the next two people did not talk too much, talking about some trivial things in life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh! Is the nun named Aida Newton living in your house?" Hank said after hearing the daily life of Su Ge. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug 愣: "Do you know Ada?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, she is in the west of the city The monastic monasticism, I have seen it several times in the past."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, Hank said with amazement: "It’s really unforgettable, Ada Newton gave me the same feeling as the goddess' messenger, so kind, pure, clean. It was a true kind person and a good person, she could make happiness from helping others, and make a living from it. I don’t feel tired. The kind of mentality, the temperament, the smile, and the saint are not too much.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge licked his hand and asked curiously : "Is it Ada can break the grid, can you become a formal nun soon?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The official nun is similar to the official clergy, and has a lot of money. salary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hank heard this hesitantly said: "In other respects, she has already exceeded the standard, but now it is a bit weird, and she has been delayed to become an official nun."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is weird?" Su Ge was very curious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The perfect Ada, how can there be weird? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hank touched and thought about it: "In the monastery, she involved two lives, although it was not directly linked, but it affected the improvement." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"啥!?" Su Ge’s eyes widened and his face was forced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ada is also involved in human life! ? How can this be! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hank sighed: "Don't say you, I didn't hear it at the time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened? I know it easily?" Su Ge is very concerned about Ada's situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hank took a look at Suger’s urgency and said: “It’s not a big deal, telling you there’s nothing wrong with it.”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That was her second year at the monastery. You know that the monastery is a big dyeing tank, and there are people inside. Most of them don’t really want to be nuns, serve the goddess, just I want to get a lot of money into the system. And Ada Newton is a true good nun and a true believer. This leads her to be too conspicuous."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In that year, the monastery came to two new nuns, and the relationship with the dean constantly bullied Ada," Hank said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge thought about it and suddenly thought that about a year ago, I really felt very tired, and occasionally there were some scars on my body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn!" Su Ge heard the anger in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You so kind people can go! Hank continued: "In the face of their bullying, Ida Newton did not say much, but instead complained with morality, while suffering from their snoring, while Help them to do the physical work of exhaustion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Su Ge suddenly clenched his fists, the anger in his heart could not be attached, and at the same time some blame Ada, she is really too kind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After half a month, weird things happened," Hank said suddenly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened?" Sugerton was hoisted with curiosity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hank said with a weird look: "On that day, Ada Newton may be too tired to sit in the church and pray. The two nuns used to ask Ada. Help them do some work, but they were rejected by Ada."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "One hour later, the two nuns were found dead in the backyard of the monastery."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;! ! ! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s incredible to hear this Sugton’s eyes wide open. Hank sighed: "No one knows why they committed suicide because everything was normal. And under normal circumstances, the two greedy nuns It is absolutely impossible to commit suicide."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge deeply agrees to nod, this kind of garbage is the most reluctant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hank continued: "According to a confession of a nun who occasionally passed the backyard, I was surprised to hear that two people were crying and crying that they were abandoned by the goddess. Now, I have lost the words of the goddess' favor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At that time Ada prayed in the vestibule, everyone can prove that this thing and she did not Relationship. But the cause and effect are very strange. The mysterious staff of the Holy See also investigated in the past and found that Ada does not have any mystery. It is an ordinary person whose spirit is regarded as 0."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although it doesn't matter, this experience is related to her after all, causing her resume to be dusty. The improvement of the past year has been stranded. The bishop means to observe for a while."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
