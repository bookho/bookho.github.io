			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the darkness, the eyes under the mask of Su Ge burned the cold ghosts and ghosts, echoing the eyes of Father Sini. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;叮叮叮...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A burst of subtle sounds can be seen, countless purple The particles rallied from the moonlight to the sword of Father Sini, and turned into the purple sword of that night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg said in a low voice: "This is the real purple moon traveler."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Father Cagnes clenched the hilt and carefully looked at the costume of Su Ge at this time. He whispered, "Who are you? Which cult belongs to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Suge truthfully said: "The evening church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"!!!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;When I heard these four words, Father Sini’s eyes tightened, and it was obvious that he had heard some rumors about the church in the late bell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eyes staring at Su Ge’s delicate costume, Father Cagnes opened his mouth and revealed the white teeth. “It seems to be a big fish.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you still think that I am a cult?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French Sini slowly tightened his body and responded: "You are not a cult, and have nothing to do with me. I am the goddess of the goddess, killing everything." The person who offended the dignity of the goddess."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, the body instantly turned into a purple streamer, and the blink of an eye came to the front of Su Ge, the purple sword With a brilliant light to the Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sound like a metal crash came, and Father Sini’s long sword seemed to have cut invisible things, and was directly stopped one foot away from Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! Boom! Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A glimpse of the sacred bells echoing around Suger’s body, Father Sini’s incomparable truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is this your signature night clock?" Father Sini took some unusual enthusiasm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge asks: "Is this the signature sword of your month?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course not!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the voice just fell, Sugerton felt that his inspiration was about to explode. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s eyes clearly saw that the body of Father Sini was distorted like a phantom, and then the body came directly to the interior of the late bell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instinct, Su Ge suddenly lifted his cane and stopped in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A slamming, the bladed confrontation, the sharp sword front slowly stopped from the top of Su Ge's head less than ten centimeters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest of Sini has some surprises, and then the left hand that has been empty for a moment immediately takes out a revolver full of complicated lines, ready to open to Su Ge’s head. gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can see it, Father Sini does intend to have the life of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s eyes tightened because he could feel the bullets of the firearms were not normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Su Ge was thinking about how to avoid the gun, Father Sini raised his left leg at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the situation that shocked Su Ge appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French Sini’s left leg is actually a mechanical prosthesis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exquisite and powerful legs unfolded at this moment, and three strong chains popped up, locking Su Ge firmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this, Sugerton was shocked, this is all his way out completely locked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A heavy bell came out, and then a huge circular shock wave spread out of Su Ge’s body, like an explosive bomb, all the surrounding open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the gunshots have already rang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two seconds later, Su Ge stepped back and forth, holding a cane The left arm is a little trembling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The physique of Father Sini is far beyond him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than a dozen meters away, Father Sini, armed with weapons, sat up on the ground with some wolverines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a lot of bricks, garbage and dust beside him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the shock wave that Su Ge just pushed together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thighs have returned to normal and the three chains have been automatically retracted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Six-level secret treasure!?" Father Sini is a bit dignified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because this man has just shown the means, he is very shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just that moment, he clearly saw that the man’s body actually turned into a virtual form. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that moment, his body retreats like a ghost, the body locked by the chain leaves through the chain, and the hair can ignore any mysterious means of sacredness. The bullet was like a normal bullet that penetrated the illusion and hit the wall behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The bullet you just got is very threatening." Su Ge’s voice was full of dignity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of that bullet is much more powerful than the bullet that Ivan invented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug can feel that the bullet has absolute destructiveness to mystery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, you can ignore all mysterious knowledge and phenomena. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug is very fortunate to his choice, directly launched the strongest means of life on the black gloves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In that moment, my body will be removed from the world and become an imaginary form outside the field. Only this purely high-dimensional state can escape this bullet. If at that time, support the night bell, It is estimated that my head has exploded."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While kicking the cans in front of him, the cockroaches on Father Sene’s face gradually dissipated, whispering: "You are Suger Sotos."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge heard this, some accidents: "I didn't expect you to call my name." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although I am a waste priest, the shelter of the goddess can make me know a lot, and at the same time have special privileges." Father Cagnes replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge asked again: "How do I see that I am coming?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You just got The ability is launched from the secret treasures of the black goats?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge did not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no denial, and only the existence outside the field can resist the sacred bullets." Father Sini seems to have ample confidence in his bullets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg still did not answer, asked: "Do you want to fight?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course Father Cagnes clenched the sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are a sorcerer." Father Cagnes has a big mouth. It seems like you want to eat Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge straightforwardly said: "I really don't like the goddess of March."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Father Cini received the purple sword in front of him and muttered: "The moonlight is a mist to isolate the horror. It is to cover the curtain of despair, to guide the mysterious mentor, for me. The light of the will..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge did not let him sing, the fist slammed forward, the horrible shock wave was like a cannon, hit I shot it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
