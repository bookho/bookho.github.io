			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s very clear to Mir asking Su Ge, he wants to take the potion again to help him experiment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of thing, Su Ge, certainly won’t agree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current Su Ge still clearly remembers the intense pain and suffocation at the time, and the feeling of festering corruption in the tongue and mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of thing, Su Ge is not going to go through the second time in his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you sure? You are rejecting a major invention of a century. If you succeed, you are the first to see if you are not a hunter. The real power of potions." Mill said tempted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is very determined, and righteously said: "My strength is enough, and I don't need the power of potions, so I refuse." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Rely on your secret profession!" Mill asked with a squint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is not hidden, confident, and resolutely said: "Yes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Suddenly, the two men looked at each other and fell silent in silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A minute later, Mill took the lead to relax: "Well, since you are so confident, go ahead and be beaten, don't come back to me." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge said with a confident face: "I have been killed from the cliff even if I was killed by Su Ge Sotos..." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Forget it, this is easy to be beaten or say less." After Suge muttered, the color said: "Next we should deal with that Little mouse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other side of the capital, the residence of the Duke of the Mountains . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great Manor has a separate castle built in the last six months. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is rumored that the guests who came here from the Duke of the Mountain Range have always been the most mysterious and most guarded place in the entire house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second floor of the castle, in some gray meeting rooms, General Jess, Mr. Arthur and Mr. Forlin sat quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three middle-aged people sitting opposite them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first look, Sven, with his eyes, with a goatee, wearing a black academic gown, looks like a professor of university. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is wearing a high-quality plaid shirt, wearing gray breeches and riding boots, and is strong, with a curly beard and a whole body with the upper body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the leader of the Emperor, the Duke of the Mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last person dressed in a white coat, with a monocle, was a little thin, and the triangle eyes shone with deep light, like a viper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the main position of the conference table, it is completely empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after the chair, there is something very similar to the ancient Chinese sedan chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a lot bigger than the sedan chair, and looks more like an enlarged version, a closed god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are four pale-faced men around this huge shrine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four men have different scars on their bodies, and they have black shackles on their necks, like slaves who have been abused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The six people did not speak at this time and seemed to be waiting for something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, a mouse that is about the size of a cat doesn’t know where it suddenly appears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can see that the mouse has short brown hair, sharp claws and powerful hind legs, but it has a look on the head and evil humans. Look like that. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Gis three seem to be eccentric about this kind of thing, and they are calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My pet said that the three of them are right, the assassin is in the palace." Deaf, as if the weathered bones are constantly grinding each other The sound of broken friction makes people hear the goose bumps in the whole body, and the fear is generated while the heart is irritated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The great moon Lord, we can contribute our intelligence and strength, but I hope you can promise us. After you master this country, you will have the right Give it to us." Giss widened his eyes and said with respect for his eagerness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This month the Lord did not speak, the side of the mountain duke said faintly: "Reassured, General Gis. Our goal is to unify all the kingdoms of the North, Build a powerful empire that believes in the Lord of the Moon, and this small place will let you rule."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear this, the three faces have a happy smile. Then he hurriedly said: "Thank you for the great Lord of the Moon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man with a professor on the left side of the mountain duke asked calmly: "I need to know the palaces." Where is the mysterious defense net, and the organs of the entire palace, the force configuration and the road map."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The force configuration and road map are no problem, but the organs and mysterious defense The network takes a while." Gis indulged in reply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The researcher of the triangle eye made a slightly sharp voice: "It doesn't matter, I will give you some gadgets, bring these things into the palace, according to my distribution. They are placed, the rest will not be taken care of."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is no problem! This is no problem!" Folin hurriedly laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of the Mountain waved and waved: "You can leave."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three people stand cautiously Get up, bow to the god, then turn and leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the three left, the Duke of the Mountain asked with respectful words: "My Lord, are these three wastes worthy of trust?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rumored voice in the gods said: "All your human thoughts are in my grasp. Your thoughts, your thoughts, everything in your eyes is so primitive and childish. ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, the three people looked very respectful and said: "My long live the Lord!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Prepare the curse, wait until the sacrifice is mature, I can lead You can see the primitive power of this god of death. Condensing these forces to make them born, you can get the power of the god of death, and you will abandon the flesh and evolve into a new form."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Every #¥%# is eager for their children, and in the end their children will die in their own hands. This is an eternal curse, inferior Even if people evolve into a high-level existence, they cannot escape this fate." The mysterious Lord of the Moon said high above. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three did not feel any discomfort and looked more fanatical. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Follow us, and worship us, you can take the right path and reach the true end of knowledge."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, a pink tentacle flashed across the black curtain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Our ignorant person will dedication to all of us!" The three men stood up and squatted on the ground, and their expressions were insane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oliver, your book of the undead is a very good sacrifice. Come to me tomorrow, I will give you a new knowledge that is far beyond ordinary people. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professor-like middle-aged man is excited when he listens, and loudly: "Thank you for the grace of the Lord!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the book of the undead, the leader of the death sect, Oliver Finn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two people on the side suddenly looked envious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go on!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord of the Moon is finished, the four slaves lifted up the gods, The pace is steady and leave here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three people here also left the conference room and walked on the manor road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It turns out that your magic book is not that book!" The researchers at the Triangle Eye were somewhat disappointed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
