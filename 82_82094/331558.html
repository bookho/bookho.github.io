			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cobweb, one of the basic spells that all occupations in the mysterious field can learn, through the psionic formation of a concealed invisible silk close-up bound target According to the psionic gap between the two sides, it can be tied for a few seconds to a few days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third night of the bell was broken, and the stalker’s tone was shocked: “What is this weird psionic shield?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge seized the opportunity to release the night bell, and instantly cut off the spider silk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the aftermath of the night clock around the stalker changes instantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not good!" The hunters felt in their hearts and the body instantly embraced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;噗嗤...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next second, blood is scattered with a lot of broken clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge tightens the sword and rushes up to the body of the stalker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the stalker suddenly rolled over to escape the thorn, and then the palm slammed into the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;唰! Hey! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, under the ground around Su Ge, six sharp javelins were suddenly shot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug sees this, the eyes are tightened like nails, if this is stabbed by these six things, Su Ge will die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the crucial moment, Su Ge’s muscles squirmed and the limit went down, and six sharp gunpoints stabbed Suger’s scalp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this attack, Su Ge was relieved. When he was preparing, he suddenly found that the six javelins gathered at the top and actually formed a Iron cage, trap yourself! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Damn! Such a narrow distance, the sword can't stretch, with my current arm, don't wave the long sword, and constantly keep these things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thinking of this, Su Ge hurriedly closed his eyes and urging a small number of spirits to release the sound wave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The six javelins were cut off in an instant, and Su Ge quickly retreated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The psionics of today are very dangerous and have bottomed out. Some use may trigger sequelae, run!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge thought about moving out of the battlefield quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗖嗖嗖! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, there was a voice behind the arrows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hell!" The poison on the shoulder, Su Ge has just learned, once it is stabbed, it is a fart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last psionic power is mobilized, and the last night is supported. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, along with the broken shield, the three arrows fell weakly on the ground, while the running Sugton was awkward and almost fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can't run!" The cold voice of the stalker came from behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg listened, clenched his teeth: "This fucking is you forced me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Halo, he took a small pill from his waist and opened it and poured it directly into his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗖! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this time, a lasso came over, a sugg was tied up, and the bloody stalker slowly came over: "The means of your kid It's really a lot, but with such high-intensity spells, psionics can't be eaten."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge slowly turns his head and can see At this time, his face was pale and his expression was awkward. He felt that the muscles of his body had a tearing pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that I was placed on a stretcher and was torn by a living. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long-term and determined Su Ge can still bear the pain, staring at the stalker and gnawing his teeth: "Why? Why can you block me?" Sharp blade?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tough hunting success, the hunter's mentality is very good, then the next step is to enter his most enjoyable part: watching the bessed beast slowly Fall into despair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the core point of his desire for self-satisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ha! Your voice blade is really amazing, but you should have heard of a thing called mysterious costume?" Saying, the stalker lifted up Hands, shaking the robes that have been chopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a good black wool, plus the scales of the lion's tail woven into a gift, has a very good mysterious defense, have to say you The sharp edge of the blade is really huge. After cutting the robes, I also scratched my skin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stalker finished, looked at the Sue pale and some blue The face, asked: "You will not have the sequelae of psionic exhaustion?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is that?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Some mysterious people whose roots are not good, or whose brain has been damaged, will have similar symptoms. After the psionic use is clean, it will cause severe headaches and Dizziness is a normal and horrible disease at a critical moment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge bit his teeth, did not answer, asked: "The two What is the trap?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hunter is more reassured after confirming that Su Ge has the disease, taking off the mask, full of red bearded Rough cheeks proudly said: "As a hunter, I want to think of all the routes and possibilities of prey. I have designed two kinds of traps here. One is that you don't have the ability to detect and step on to trigger. The second is You have a certain ability to detect and see in advance. When your spirit is able to radiate, it will trigger in advance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Trap placement Two on each side, one is a vine trap and one is a poison arrow. No matter if you step on both sides . In a will in the move "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;"The log that fell from the sky, and the six javelins are also traps!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, these two are temporary traps. Through runes and mysterious means Produced, when fighting, according to the situation through the psionics to stimulate." Said, the stalker with a prominent out of the arms to take out the different colors of the sphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is an explosion trap, this is a frost trap, this is a thorn trap..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Listening to him, Su Ge’s ear began to scream with intense tinnitus, and he couldn’t hear what he was saying. His line of sight was gradually blurred, as if he were going to faint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time I saw Su Ge’s situation, the stalker’s face was gloomy and looked bad: “Little prey, I haven’t finished yet! You are not qualified yet.” Halo past!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of the big step forward, pull out the dagger at the waist, ready to open a hole in the thigh thigh, let him wake up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he approached, he suddenly felt that the situation was wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately, he took a blue sphere from his arms and crushed it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shield that was just supported was suddenly broken, and the stalker snorted: "Rabbit!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The voice just fell, his legs flashed a blue light, the body suddenly jumped back, and jumped three meters away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the basic spells: Rabbit Jump. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incorporating a fixed rune on the legs, injecting psionic energy into the muscles and bones in an instant, creating a powerful jumping ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This side Su Ge directly broke the rope, gasping and standing up, at this time can see the pupil of his prototype turned into a monster erect, The blood vessels under the white face are black and very strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You crazy! You drank the potion!?" Seeing this scene, the stalker shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
