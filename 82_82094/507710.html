			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at Andrew at this time, Su Ge suddenly remembered one of the rumors about the Wolf Legion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the entanglement with the abyss, there is no possibility to get out of the way, so the selection of the Wolf Legion is to choose from the death penalty in each country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people themselves are damn people who can contribute to the entire continent before they die, blocking the erosion of the abyss, which is what any country is happy to see. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, as long as you bear the vows, the criminal will not escape, even more secure than the death penalty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Su Ge looked at Andrew’s face full of vicissitudes, knowing that this brother is also a storyteller. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You came in this adventure just to save people?" Andrew asked at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge bluntly said: "Of course not. My goal this time is to explore the source of this variation. The aftermath of the variation of the ancient city has spread to the whole world. There is something hidden in it, I have to investigate it clearly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrew is full of vicissitudes and looks at Su Ge: "Look at you about to leave the Church of the Holy Blood." In fact, you want to know something, I can tell you some."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? You don't seem to be waiting for the Church of the Holy Blood." Su Ge was surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the first time this has been discovered. In the conversation with the fortress, he faintly found that the fortress is also secretly vigilant. Church of the Holy Blood. Andrew said straightforwardly: "On the essence of it, there is no difference between the Church of the Holy Blood and those cults, but they are stronger and stronger enough to make the world a whole." Rules."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, I agree with this statement."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nod Then, the right color asked: "Since you have been here for so long, I know very well about the situation here. I want to know where the origin of this mutation originated?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrew turned to look southeast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looked down at his sight, just to see where a majestic and solemn palace is located on a relatively high mountain in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it a ghost of the royal family?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ande nodded slightly: "They can say that they are hidden deep, even the landslide that was 80 years ago was their self-directed performance."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do they really intend to re-revive the Byron Dias Empire through the ancient gods? It is completely impossible for this era to revive an empire by this method." Negative. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrew said faintly: "Of course it is impossible, this is just the beginning. Now all the people who come here are just sacrifices."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Sacrifice of the Soul of the Soul?" Su Ge asked with a squint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrew looked at him: "I know a lot."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"About A month ago, I felt a special kind of volatility in the Totem Temple at the headquarters. This kind of volatility was connected to the abyss across the void, and the connection between them ignited the warning of the totem. I read a lot of ancient books and related materials and found it. The root of the problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrew looked at the palace and said: "About eighty-five years ago, our Wolf Blood Legion had been stolen through one thing." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A skull."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Skull!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This skull was found in the cave on the second floor of the bottom of the abyss, and in that cave There are also a large number of ancient texts related to the remains of murals. After deciphering, these words were found in the relevant teaching texts used during the period of Kabatos College. Among them, we saw one Huge monster corpses "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;".? People become "Scotch breath asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, the monster stands up almost five meters high. Although the skeleton has some traces, it is already non-human. When our people enter, the bones on the body are quickly weathered, leaving only one big, inhuman. Skull."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg thought about it and asked: "Is it something to tell about it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp Andrew squinted and asked seriously: "Are you sure you want to know? The monster has been entangled with the abyss for many years and is already part of the abyss. The abyss is strange, you may not know, even if you Knowing the inner knowledge related to the abyss, then you and it will be entangled, there is no possibility of separation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s hands clasped He said: "I think that when I saw your face, I was already entangled with the abyss."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, Andrew touched it. My face suddenly laughed: "I am not as terrible as I am?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug also laughed and said: "I thought that the people of the Wolf Blood Legion should be cold-blooded, cruel and bitter, and I didn't expect you to be quite interesting." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrew leaned on the box and replied: "This is a subjective impression. In fact, in that kind of despair and fear, often optimistic people can live longer, crazy. It's slower. You will find that the people of the Wolf Legion are actually very humorous."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, I can feel it."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a simple joke, Andrew explained: "The man is Carl Byron, one of the teachers of Kabatos College about 10,000 years ago." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The son of Byron the Great?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, how can he have no evidence of his life? In terms of words, he left the college before the accident in Kabatos and went to the abyss. He was already five hundred years old."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Five hundred years old!? Can humans live for so long?” Su Ge’s eyes widened with shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrew explained: "To reach the level of the great sage and above, the form of the body can be greatly extended. Now the world is known as the three big The sages are already over the age of three hundred."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait! There are actually three great sages in the world?" Su Ge was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andre some accidents: "I am now beginning to suspect that your identity is impersonating. This basic thing, you are the bishop of the Church of the Holy Blood, actually not Know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃呃..." Sugerton looked very embarrassed and explained: "I am a half-way monk, there are many basic things I don't understand. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Andrew said nothing more, "These three great sages, although known, have rarely appeared. They have all created a genre." And even a great man of learning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you introduce it a little?" Su Ge's curiosity and curiosity were provoked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Andrew also has this intention, said: "The first name is Amon Solomon. He created a new kind of knowledge, demon summoning. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Summon the devil?" Su Ge was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil is not a Yi, belongs to the original monster of this world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are relatively advanced creatures that have been human-oriented since ancient times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later, the goddess of March came and summed them into the system of vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the eyes of Su Ge, the so-called demons are actually the creations of the ancient gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demon is generally more combative. The lowest level of the demon is the third sequence of the vision system, which requires a flame demon that can be seen at 35. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andr nodded. "Yes, this summoning technique will be very powerful in many ribs. For example, bards, such as the sorcerer, such as alchemy. Warlocks, etc."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The bard can also summon demons?" Su Ge stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, the bard itself is a profession that uses poetry and legends through psionics. Their core is to celebrate and spread, to make more People believe. The most direct way to believe is to be present."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge touched his chin: "I always thought that bards and musicians are all the same."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Andrew continues: "The second great sage Called Catherine Helen. She pioneered a new theory called current. She analyzed the principle of current conduction in detail, the reasons for its formation, the methods used, and the related details. It can be said that she is now the world's electrical development. The enlightenment and founder."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The third great sage is called Eric Pierce. He made the first two hundred years ago. Taiwan's automatic patrol robots combined with steam mechanics and mysterious arrays, followed by police robots, anti-mystery robots, steel warships, and sky warships are all based on this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hearing this, Su Ge finally had a clear understanding of the so-called Daxian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three are arguably the great men who have created a new history. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Back to the topic, this Carl is a great sage-level warlock, very good at summoning and praying. He is about to be in Cabatos When I was in trouble, I felt the induction and left the college to enter the abyss alone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge heard this and said hurriedly: "Wait, I have a question. Carl is A great sage, then he has also developed a new system? What is the system he created?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrew replied: "Not all big The things invented by the sage are applicable to ordinary people, and the knowledge of all the great sages is willing to share with others. The sea of ​​knowledge is endless, and people can reach the height of the sage by simply composing one of the water droplets. This kind of knowledge does not have to open up a new era, let people remember, understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge nodded, not knowing that they do not exist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Karl got some ancient knowledge in the abyss, guiding him to complete the spirits through his own spirits, summoning Byron the Great." Andrew Speaking of a shocking news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge's big eyes: "Byron the Great? Byron the Great is still alive?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrew looked at the palace and said faintly: "Byron is called the god of dreams, and the great god is integrated with the concept. As long as people still dream, the god of dreams will not disappear."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He didn't know how long it took him to succeed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Success!!" Shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Then he learned a lot about the secrets of ancient times. After a simple meeting with the sons and children, Byron and the priests hurriedly left for some reason. After a long time, Karl Everything that is extremely poor, wants to return to the spirit. And this time, he is the holy grail of the soul of ancient times."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The result!?" Su Ge breathed a bit heavy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andr slowly squeezed his fist: "He is still successful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pump! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge’s heart slammed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can’t imagine how terrible the power of the Great Sage, not only to summon the Great God, but even to summon the Holy Grail! ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But the Holy Grail only appeared for a moment, and he witnessed the appearance of the Holy Grail." Andrew calmly said Carl's ending. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug is in silence and doesn't know how to evaluate it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After that, he died in the cave, after which we discovered his bones. At that time, the dozens of warriors who witnessed the skull turned into horror. The monsters, and finally our three heads of the army personally took the seal and carried it to our headquarters."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" However, just a year later, it Was stolen by someone," Andrew said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looked at the palace: "Is it stolen by the Byron Dias?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Andrew nodded: "At the time we didn't know, even the flooding of the ancient city did not attract our attention. Until this rhythm, let me discover that the skull seems to be here. And Byron Dias The royal family is centered on this skull and sacrifices, eager to summon the Holy Grail."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about the hunter?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andr swayed his head: "I don't know this very well. When I entered the city, I encountered a team of hunters and I was killed."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;! ! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this understatement, Su Ge blinked his eyes and returned to God for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it a five-person squad?" Su Ge confirmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andu nodded: "A master, four experts, although troublesome, still killed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Brother, do you know how terrible you just said?" Su Ge asked him silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andr shakes his head: "I don't know much about the hunter, I don't know if it's strong."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Su Ge thought back to the proud Sapir, and the clergy who were very difficult to deal with the two hunters. He sighed: "It really is a monster."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; After knowing the ins and outs of the whole thing, Su Ge continued to ask his doubts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Those members of the royal family who held the ceremony?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrew raised his chin and looked at the palace: "It’s all in the palace, they are still tricky. The emperor is at least the leader, very difficult. But it's okay, what they seem to be waiting for, these days have been in the palace, never came out at once."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leader?" Su Ge The heart was filled with caution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Master to the lord is a scorpio. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerousus is already a smart person, but he has been stuck on the threshold of the lord for decades. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not apocalypse, it’s estimated that he will be a cardholder for a lifetime. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same is true for Randall and Adeline. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have to be careful, the things in the outer city are nothing but the lowest level of miscellaneous soldiers. The real threat is the royal family near the palace."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The royal family?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is the descendants of the emperor and the queen, they become very horrible, I once tried to enter the palace, and I was almost killed by a dozen royal families.” Andrew said, standing up and continuing to move his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What information?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The only thing I know is that they are extremely good at mental attacks. When I first moved forward, when I felt that the inspiration was about to break, I spread the damage through the Wolf Blood Covenant, or I was already dead."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Speaking of this, Andrew has some feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suger’s heart was full of vigilance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The outer city should also be careful. The whole city is very complicated, divided into the inner side and the front side. The outer city is now on the side of the table, only has some crazy descendants and The mutated villagers. After being transformed into the inner side, those mental parasites, as well as the royal family, can act automatically, which is the real danger."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing This, Su Ge immediately thought of what Alger had said before. The scene in the city is not as clean as it is on the surface, but full of filth and surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about the inner city?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The inner city I estimate is still the side, if If you flip it to the inside, it is estimated that the people in the palace will be free to move." When it comes to this, Andrew's face is dignified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge took a deep breath and found that the situation here was much more complicated than he had imagined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now these people are not enough, at least the leader level of talent," Andrew cautioned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗷呜呜...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, there was a scream of screaming from the bottom, and the attacking monster stopped attacking again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrew picked up the sword and fiddled with the two shoulder guns on his shoulder and said, "Okay, you can leave. Thank you for your assistance."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge looked at his wide and lonely back and asked: "Is it really not going to leave? In your current state, there is no difference between continuing and sending death. The body has recovered on the surface, but your psionics, your bones and bones have reached the edge of the collapse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Andrew tightened the hilt and said: "This is My choice. I have no choice from small to large. This is the first time in my life to make decisions based on my own will. I have to carry it through."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hearing this, Su Ge had some inexplicable feelings in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He likes this type of person, he likes this belief, likes this tenacity and fortitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pinch the cane, and then throw a blood therapy pharmacy: "Help people help the end, send the Buddha to the West. You continue to rest, I help You stay in the dark, this active agent can make up for the fatigue of the body and the darkness of the bones and muscles. After the injection, it will take about three hours of muscle weakness, and the movement can't be."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Pinch this pharmacy, Andrew looked at the figure of Suge's cloak hunting, snorted and sat on the floor, grinning: "That will come in the next few hours."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, the second thing is to inject the medicine into the neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few seconds, his body was soft and weak and fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's so trusting me? I can kill you at any time." Su Ge turned back and said indifferently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anduhaha smiled: "If you want to kill, you can kill it. It’s rare to have a chance. I really have to sleep well."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, the next second of closing his eyes, the loud snoring came from his nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嘎嘎嘎......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time the monsters around have climbed up, and the first batch came up with about fifteen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug took off his hat, his mouth slowly opened, revealing white teeth, his face with excitement: "Come!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, he can finally have a painful and bright, unparalleled match. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chain sword is opened, and the bodies of several monsters are chopped in an instant, and the other hand pushes forward, and the invisible shock wave will prepare a few Attack Andrew's monster and fly straight out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the chain sword retracted, and the hands clasped together and then swung around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enhanced sonic blade instantly shreds the surrounding monsters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded with satisfaction and expressed satisfaction and satisfaction with the psionic control.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This When the second wave of monsters came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s eyes flashed in the light, standing calmly on Andrew’s side, chain swords, long swords, rifles, chains and non-stop changes to kill monsters . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, it is like a watch-like precision psionic control, precisely with the lowest psionic energy consumption to kill the surrounding monsters at full speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For this situation, Su Ge’s killing effect is much higher than Andrew’s. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After an hour, Su Ge’s side has accumulated a lot of corpses, and Su Ge’s clothes are not even contaminated with blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thick bell rang and suddenly pushed all the bodies around him down with the monsters on the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the dim tower was restored to light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge gasped, and he felt his arms sore and he lost consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the feet did not move, but the hands have not been idle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s okay at first, but it’s an enormous load for Suger’s body to wave the chain sword for an hour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking down at the broad sword in Andrew’s hand, Su Ge couldn’t help but admire this wolf-blood warrior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This big sword is constantly waving for ten hours to kill the enemies like the tide, which is unimaginable to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not manually, Su Ge put all his attention on the psionics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an hour, his massive psionics have consumed 50%. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the result of precision savings. If it is yesterday's situation, it is estimated that it will dry up after ten minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also don’t care if it’s dirty or dirty, Sug’s ass sits on the blood, accurately calculating any psionic power or by vibrating, or killing through a sharp blade. One monster after another. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brain is running at a rapid speed, and the control can be used more and more accurately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, it takes more than forty audio blades to kill fifteen monsters at first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gradually more and more precise control of the sonic edge, from forty to thirty, twenty...<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gradually, he can even use fifteen sonic blades to cut off the heads of fifteen monsters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the structure of the sonic blade, Su Ge, also began to carry out in-depth research, whether it is a crescent shape, a round shape, or a triangle, Still good in diamond shape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How much of the vibration can achieve the best cutting results, the amplitude can be more stable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many psionics can be used to keep the blade from collapsing while still achieving the lowest cuts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
