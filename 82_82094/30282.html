			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge looked at the two confused people, and he was caught in a tangled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His home is very small, and there are no fewer than five people. And he does not want to be tired of his brother and sister in this aspect of the problem. After all, the crime of harboring the witch is not small. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But nowadays, the city of Bain is more prosperous, and there are few places where people can hide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are too many people during the day and it is not convenient to act. In the evening, there are church night patrols, and it is even more dangerous to act. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a moment, Su Ge did not know how to put the two witches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the bells of the church in the city center sounded again, symbolizing that half of the afternoon time has passed, and it represents the beginning of afternoon tea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge, who heard the bell, suddenly thought: "Wait, I seem to have a magic workshop."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;This me, is Suger Sotos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge Sotos was a occult lover from his teens, and in the words of the earth, he was suffering from a serious illness. juvenile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was already a cure after adulthood. As a result, because of contact with the death sect, the thunder was ignited, and Su Ge suddenly fell into it, just like a demon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has always dreamed that he can complete mysterious spells, so he prepared himself a hidden "magic workshop" early<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a reservoir on the ground floor of an abandoned factory in the suburbs. After the factory was abandoned, the entire reservoir was empty and turned into a four-meter-high, approximately 40-square-meter concealed room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than half a year, Su Ge’s smashing and constantly smashing, his own hands-made beds, experimental tables, candles, stored kerosene and Cheese, it is his second home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went for a trip before the accident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Su Ge’s arrival, Su Ge Sotos’s memory was a bit confusing and broken, and many things could not be remembered without careful thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Suge turned his head and said, "Can you still move now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The two immediately nodded and said, "No problem!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge quickly put things into the box and said: "Now is the time when people go to work, people on the street Rarely, it is the best time for your activities. Now go with me. I will take you to a place that is not too far away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Two people are full of happiness, nodded hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After everything was finished, Su Ge looked up carefully and looked around, sure that no one else would let two people out, and then three people went down the school. The back door ran to the wilderness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The factory is located on the northwest side of the city, at the foot of a hill on a hill, about two kilometers from here, a short distance from the place where Su Ge was originally thrown . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of school is an uninhabited field, with a lot of yellow grass and a few lonely scarecrows standing on the white snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The loss of the protection of the city's tall buildings, a burst of cold wind blowing in the face, blowing people is cool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, Su Ge is close to being immune to the cold, and the two witches can also resist the big cotton jacket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With no one around, three people rushed to the factory along the path in the field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was very quiet all the way. After fifteen minutes, the three men trotting all the way to the abandoned factory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are now quicksands and rolling stones throughout the factory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a large factory here, because the mudslide landslide flooded the entire plant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning, all the money of the boss was used to compensate the families of the dead, and he went bankrupt and went into prison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the factory cleaning and reconstruction costs were too alarming, the auction was all three times, and it has been abandoned for five years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge followed the route in memory and did not walk into the buried factory, but came to the back of the factory along the field without roads, a thorough Buried, wilderness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the grass, in a ditch covered by large stones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the ditch, there is a door that is unlocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This door is very concealed and completely covered by stone. In front of the door is a blackened enclosed space of up to three meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not a straight line in a two-meter-deep ditch, you don’t know that there is a door at the end of the black hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My God, it’s really secret. How did you find out?" Bernice widened his eyes and asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled and said: "Occasionally, just after the rain that day, I slipped from the top and rolled down the ditch. When I looked up the sun, I just saw the door."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go, it’s safe." Suge walked in, side I also touched the wall, here is the alarm device that he deployed before, a thin line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the line is broken, it means that someone has been there, and if it is not broken, it means safety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The line is now broken, indicating that it is still safe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The iron gate is not locked, but it is entangled in the chain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open the iron door and it will be dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be careful, the front is the steps, and the two sides are the verandas." Suge lit a candle to illuminate the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to be a small swimming pool, surrounded by a ring of iron fences that allow people to walk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wall is engraved with a water line, surrounded by solid stone walls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The front is the step to the lower side. It looks like about thirty knots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After carefully stepping down the steps, Su Ge lit the kerosene lamp on the table, and the bright flame illuminates the entire pool through the glass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two sisters look around the light, on the corner to the left of the room, there is a simple wooden bed with shabby stalls and quilts and pillows. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The left side of the steps is a rectangular table with lots of books on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other side is also a table, which is filled with chalk, various quirky materials, crystal cups, divination balls and many other occult materials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still no magical array on the ground. The right corner of the wall is filled with a few barrels of kerosene, a few buckets of water, dried cheese, bread, dried fish and bacon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other corner is a simple cooktop with pots and pans on top. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge said: "Although it is very simple, it still guarantees that you can live normally."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, Hillston said with excitement: "Thank you, the apostle!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This environment is simply for them It is heaven. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warm, cold house, the place to live, the food to eat, these are the two biggest dreams of both of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug does not intend to stay here for too long, said: "There is kerosene here to boil water. If you need water, you can go outside to get some snow. If you encounter When people try not to talk actively, don't panic. If they are hostile, you will catch them. I will come back in two days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
