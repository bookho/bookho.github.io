			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the disgusting insects in Su Ge’s hands, Elena frowned and said, “It’s no brains.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No brain worm, subordinate independent Yi, need to see 18 points to see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because no brains are not aggressive and malicious, they can parasitize humans regardless of the principle of "ignorance and fearlessness". <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Yi was first discovered about 1,500 years ago. It looks like bread worms and has a large number of tentacles like bristles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are mainly parasitic, and can survive in nature, survive by foraging leaves and photosynthesis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They don't have any offensiveness, and ordinary people can easily pinch them to death after the vision is reached. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parasitic method without brains is very convenient and different. Its tentacle has a special effect. It can be easily integrated into the skin without touching the human body. Underneath into the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After entering the body, its tentacles begin to accelerate and extend, and connect to the movements and reflexes of the body. At the same time, the worm will gradually crawl upwards and eventually come to the biological brain to eat it clean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a male and female population that will reproduce after getting enough brain nutrition from the brain, and can produce ten to twenty eggs at a time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parasitic human can temporarily gain some physical blessings, and gradually stimulate the most primitive violent and animal nature of human beings, and will be completely mad after being parasitized for about five hours. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the nerve is controlled by the brainless insect, there is no weakness in the body, so even if you receive any attack, you can exercise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, this thing is parasitic from the feet, crawling more slowly, and now only climbs to the chest." Su Ge does not intend to pinch it, carefully Looking at it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illina responded: "It is estimated that some nurses have already eaten their brains and started spawning, but the problem is not big. Those bodies have already let me burn. Only the gray is left, and the insects and eggs will die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hills heard a curious question: "What is your ability? Flame?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illina shook her head: "No, my talent is Burning, by using psionic energy, directly causes some flammable objects to burn fiercely. I cannot produce flames and release flames by myself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The burning witch, Well, this name is really right for you." Su Ge held the bug and stood up and said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How's it!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, in Jimmy and Vegniya Under the protection, Vanas quickly came over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today’s Vanas put on a white dress that looks fresh and refined, dignified and noble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vegginia next to him also changed his clothes. The heavy armor took off and put on a silver-gray tight-fitting light armor that Vanas had specially prepared for her. Under the light armor was a tight-fitting body covering the whole body, wearing gloves on the hand, which had the same effect as the previous armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general situation of the matter she already knows, I heard that there are two doctors and three nurses. Already burned four by Elena, and one is at large. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he saw Sug standing aside, Vanas sighed and came over and asked, "How is the situation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illina explained: "Well, it was solved by Su Ge, not the problem of these nurses, they were parasitized by brainless insects."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No brains!" Vanas listened to the look of surprise, turned to look at the insect in Su Ge's hands still squirming, his face pale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although she is not a person in the mysterious circle, but some basic Yi people still know the relevant information, so it is very clear about the horror and nausea of ​​this thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Sotos, you are careful. These things can even penetrate your clothes through the clothes," Vanas said quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, it can be seen that the worm is struggling fiercely, and the tentacles above the tent are tempted by Su Ge’s fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But unfortunately, the infiltration method before it was not useful in the face of this black leather glove. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illina stared at Su Ge’s glove carefully: "This glove feels...somewhat strange, did you get it from there?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled: "Sent by others."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking, added: "I am the most trustworthy "The partner."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the conversation was in the crowd, Mill was still wearing the blue pajamas, and he came over with fire and wind, when he saw the brainlessness in Su Ge’s hands. After the insect, his face dignified: "The worry is still happening."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded and agreed, then said: "I can find something to save this. What is it? I will first purify the souls of these dead people, and by the way, see if I can get any clues."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Irene and others Suddenly curious, they have not seen the priest who can communicate with the dead soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mir touched under his nightgown and took out the metal bottle: "Use this dress first."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This thing is okay? The penetration of no brainworms is still very strong." Su Ge reminded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassured, the ability to penetrate is strong and can't hold alcohol. If you put it in, you will be drunk, and you can't move." Mill said, unscrew the bottle cap and let Su Ge put in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The worm was handled well, and the blood on the mittens was rubbed. Su Ge looked around: "Ordinary people leave."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear this, Vanas immediately said: "Jimmy, you go down first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..." Jimmy wants To refute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go down." Vanas's tone gives an unquestionable oppression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jimmy bit his teeth and then stepped back to the female soldier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
