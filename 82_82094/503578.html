			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unplug the Great God Declaration, Su Ge turned and said: "Go back, this is also a lot of gains. If you continue to go deep, there will be some advent."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selina nodded and followed Sug back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗷呜呜呜...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, suddenly came out in the city A long and sorrowful wolverine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This wolverine is very special, giving an indescribable excitement and puncture, just like a wolf king commanding his wolves to charge the enemy. general. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sound gives Sug a special feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of Lobo's reasons, he has a special feeling, or induction, for this particular wolverine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He felt a madness from this wolf that was born out of despair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serina didn’t feel anything, and Sugg, who looked at the pace and hesitated, asked, “What’s wrong?”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge's dark eyes look at the middle of the city and take back the line of sight: "Go, go back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This side When two people followed the street back to the gate, they heard an explosion and a series of screams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn! It’s a hunter!" Serena saw these words and rushed straight out to her team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The formation at the gate of the city is completely chaotic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About a dozen clergymen have been possessed by the kind of spiritual parasites, killing them among their peers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most dangerous thing about being possessed by mental parasites is that they are crazy, but they have all the knowledge before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even under the control of mental parasites, their knowledge proficiency is actually more fluid and powerful than normal, which is very scary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only these dozen clergy have caused huge casualties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, more crazy descendants do not know where to appear, and have already fought with the rest of the mysterious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The physical activity and toughness of these crazy descendants are not comparable to those of the mutated villagers, and the attacks of ordinary means are as ticking as they are. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, just these, the fineness of the church can also be dealt with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, there are five humanoid monsters in the battlefield with worn gray-black armor and dirty coats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They took all kinds of weapons, masks, and three bloody eyes could not see any human feelings, killing people around a horrible speed The clergy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hunter five people are divided into three groups at this time, two people in a group for perfect attack and defense, can easily deal with more than a dozen clergy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And their captain, the hunter with four eyes and a relatively burly body is fighting with Sapir. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four-eye hunter's speed and movement are very fast, while skilled use of daggers, smashing arrows, psychic shields, and spells that interfere with enemy spirit and vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sapiel at this time, although somewhat embarrassed, but still faintly grasp the advantages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hunter of the hunter has a very good electrical conductivity, which is a huge advantage for Sapir, who is the leader of lightning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thunder resistance is a negative four-eyed hunter, even if the overall strength is higher than Sapir, at this time is firmly suppressed by Sapir, unable to get out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the fortress, Moore alone responded to two expert-level hunters, he seems to be very familiar with them, very calm, for The attack of the two men was easily escaped by the prophet. Then they seized the attack interval between the two people and the subtle flaws that were difficult to detect by ordinary people. In almost a few breaths, the arm of a hunter was first cut off and penetrated. Another hunter's chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the rest of the people who are not in the fortress are forming a formation to help the clergy to deal with the other two hunters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Horace at the gate of the city has already fixed five mad clergy who are possessed by his own hypnotism. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time lead others to deal with other possessed clergy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the rest are pulling distance to deal with these crazy descendants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, eleven clerics were killed, eight seriously injured were sent out of the city, 24 were slightly injured, and they were scared and mad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the losses are heavy, but now it is stable, and it takes only a few moments to win. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sug! Come help!" Sapir's hammer released current at this time, and the four-eyed hunter shook his body and shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded, but did not help him, but rushed directly to the gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dodge! These parasites can be attached to other people!" Suge ran as he ran. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Horace at the door is an old fritter, and when he hears this, he jumps in his heart and his body jerkes back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost at this moment, five of the five clergymen suddenly appeared in the shadows, and rushed to other clergy around them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not good! Avoiding!" The clergyman screamed and his body quickly receded, but their speed was completely inferior to the speed of the shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, Su Ge arrived at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Su Ge, who ran over, slammed his hands together, and a burst of horror ripples like water waves emerged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of a heavy stone hitting the bell came out, and a trumpet-shaped epicenter wave suddenly emerged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗡嗡嗡......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone in the entire battlefield felt a violent shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether the body, the ground, the weapon, or even the psionic power are resonated by this horrible shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My God! What is this knowledge!?" Many mysterious people see this, and the eyes are tightened like nails. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five black shadows that are about to succeed are completely unthinkable of the appearance of Su Ge, which was directly blasted a few meters away by the vibration wave and hit the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Suger attack did not stop after the success, and the body caught the sky with a cane and became a sharp sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One foot on the ground, like stepping on the big clock, a heavy sense of oppression spread out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, Su Ge’s body is like being popped up, flying directly five meters away to the wall, the sword in his hand brings a burst of people The dazzling Jianguang, in the blink of an eye, cut the four shadows into two halves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last one left to jump again and pounce on Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be careful! Bishop Sotos!" said Horace in his mouth, but did not mean to do anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touch! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadow was just less than a meter in front of Su Ge, and it was shaken out by the invisible force and hit the wall again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the upgrade status of the night clock, not only defense, but also rebound through violent vibration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sword in the hand is rotated, with a beautiful sword flower, which is gripped by the palm of Su Ge, and then stabbed from top to bottom, through the shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all the processing, Su Ge spit out a sigh of relief and turned his head slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, the battlefield was silent, and all the people around him stared at Su Ge, and they were deeply shocked to return to God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Quickly end the battle." Su Ge said at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the talents returned to God and continued to annihilate a small number of enemies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After fifteen minutes, Sapir and Joel’s two masters did not leave the four-eyed hunter, and they fled at the expense of two arms. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Invent the wounded, quickly quit!" At this time, the tired and breathless Sapir shouted and took the lead to rush out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, the coalition quickly launched the city, leaving only the body of a monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looked at the coalition that was full of fatigue and gestures, and did not speak and turned into the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing?" Moore came over and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, several other master bishops have come, including Joel, Sapir, Horace, and the bishop of the Elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fighting power, means, responsiveness, and strange knowledge that Su Ge just showed made these people feel deeply shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even Joel and Sapir did not dare to look down on Su Ge at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looks at the city road: "There seems to be other people inside, I have to go back and see the situation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you sure?" asked Horace's temptation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge casually said: "I have not lived enough, and things that are not sure will not do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you still have a few people?" Moore suggested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug shook his head: "My people are all down the mountain, others are not using them well, I am very good, not tired."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This statement is very proud, but no one feels what is wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sapir objected: "Your combat power is very important to the coalition forces. I don't agree with this death."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holas nodded slightly: "I think so too."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moore has some surprises, how these two old foxes care about Suge ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he wanted to understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge did not bring people, there is no credit, he is not qualified to divide the spoils. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if Su Ge enters the city and not only saves people but also gets intelligence, then he can have enough contribution to divide the things that belong to them, and the two naturally Will agree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge looked at the two, even did not speak, turned and left, alone into a city full of crisis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sapir and Horace saw this and looked at each other and saw the helplessness in the other's eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is best to die in the city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moore turned to look at two people "According to the church covenant, the hunter of the disaster appears and will be treated as the highest priority. Now I officially announce that the law enforcement team will not be involved and hope that the two bishops will cooperate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two listened to some hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called cooperation is naturally to give up the command of two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How? Do the two bishops want to undermine the covenant?" Moore brows slightly and asks faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heras immediately smiled: "Of course not, heal the church and welcome the borrowing of the law enforcement team."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Sapir followed and nodded: "I hope that you will not take our people to death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
