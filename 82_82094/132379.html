			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to Su Ge’s words, Adeline was rarely confused but confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then she carefully looked at the two people of Hills and asked: "So, is your management successful now?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s face confidently said: “Of course, both Hills and Bernice are very stable now, and you should feel it. If it’s not just two people who show their faintness, With feeling and vision, can you recognize that two people are witches?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adeline shook her head, and she did not recognize it at the beginning. It was the flaw that I saw when Mrs. Michelle was watching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, will your church accept only witches in the future?" Adelin asked again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge was silent and fell into thinking: "The witch is innocent, and the female warlock seems to be even more innocent. She was only killed because of political inaccuracy." And the female warlocks are all elites, and it seems that they should be good if they are absorbed into them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait, if this is the case, it seems to be the Church of the Holy Blood. The existence of heresy should not all be a madman who likes to engage in things, but because some aspects touch the interests of the church, or a few vulnerable groups that are wanted for other reasons."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "If that's the case, can I absorb all the heretics in this way!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think of this, Su Ge The heart suddenly became excited, because he felt that the idea was so interesting, and it was exciting to think about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Su Ge looked up and looked at Adeline seriously: "Of course not, I will contain and manage all heresy! Witch, female warlock, vampire, even The legendary undead can be."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The desire of human beings will expand as power and power grow, if one day you really control these There is a huge energy presence, what do you want to do?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question is very heavy and challenging. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge was silent for a long time, thinking about the goal that he really longed for. Then he said, "I will contract a place, live in the castle, have a large piece of land. Sing and sing with them, all kinds of land, live a leisurely pastoral Life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ha!?" This time it was Adeline’s turn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s body leaned on the chair and spread his hand and said, “Don’t be surprised, I think so now. After all, I’m hosting some of them. Poor people, should this kind of person yearn for this kind of life? I also like it very much, living in a big villa, living a life with a beautiful and lively maid who is not shameless... cough!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After waiting, Su Ge got out of fantasy and looked at Aideline’s righteousness: “Well, this is my goal.”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Listening to Su Ge’s words, the two witches behind him were brought into such an illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle, two people feel that they are walking on the path in the country, the sun is shining on the top, the wheat is swaying on the wind, and the distance is far away. Xianghe Castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The refreshing breeze blows over, and the compatriots who are uncontested in the world run wildly in the field...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Adeline’s eyes flashed with a strange purple color. She seemed to see the fantasy of the two witches. She said with a smile on her lips: “Those lives really make countless people fascinated.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled: "I can say what I can say, then is it time to get to the point?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Aideline converges on the smile and casual on the face, and puts down the leg and said: "Then, I will tell you what we investigated, according to the meaning of Gerlos. You have to listen carefully, then This thing is solved."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, Adeline said with a weird smile: "And listen to your ambition, I found that you are suitable for handling This event."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge, who feels the approval, said: "I will try my best, please." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aideline said directly: "First, the first point, how much do you know about the Green Flame Brotherhood?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Learn some, they seem to be here to summon the original fire Su Ge said directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? You still know a lot!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have my channel "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then the following is much simpler. The Green Flame Brotherhood now intends to use the farm as an altar to sacrifice the original fire by sacrifice. Gerlos has discovered the ritual for the sacrifice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This thing is more complicated, although the female warlock sisters participate, but only observe, there is no Because I am the representative of the sorority. The Institute of Polar Studies has a total of five people, and now one is dead, four are lurking, ready to snatch when the original fire summons success."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Assassin League is here too, but their goal is not the original fire, but the holy grail document behind the original fire. There are three people coming together, the latent state."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The cold-hearted church seems to be involved too. I have seen a cold-hearted church person who is in this area and the green flame brother. There will be some tacit understanding."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The last two should be careful, one is the senior vampire who came here from the night of the North. This guy you want Extremely careful. Because the advanced vampires themselves are a mysterious phenomenon, they are similar to a high-level life form, and we humans can't kill them even if they crush them."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg heard this and nodded solemnly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The second one is still uncertain, you have a number in your heart, because you and this thing are not at all a level." With that, Adeline face It is dignified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Su Ge hurriedly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aideline said seriously: "According to the information we sent from the North Wind, a storm dragon that has been sleeping for five hundred years suddenly flies to the mainland. Come."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
