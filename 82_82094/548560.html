			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clergymen are silent, and the three archbishops are somewhat uncomfortable, but they are the archbishops of the church after all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sitting in this position, they already have the bones and bones, falling into the abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quickly sum up the matter and prepare to report directly to the Holy See. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The value that Su Ge showed at this time has far exceeded the expectations of Laurie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This must be known to the Holy See and to stay in the March church at all costs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He won't leave directly, since they know so much about the astral world, they will let it go after knowing the black goats of Mori." Laurie whispered. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;枭No words, the Holy Word brows slightly wrinkled: "Do you let us use his sense of responsibility? He grabbed him when he helped us fight off the gods." Live?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Laurie said with a serious attitude: "The words of one side are not credible, who knows what other purposes they have, and the ideals of the ideal are just deceiving us. You must be clear that the goddess chose us and the whole world is under the protection of the goddess. Everything in the hands of the church is the best choice for this world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp When you hear this, the Holy Spirit takes a deep breath, and the struggle in your eyes gradually becomes numb and indifferent: "Yes, the church must master the whole world and cannot let the previous tragedy repeat itself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those most mysterious and horrifying outsiders, the March church has always lacked a great deal of knowledge and related intelligence, causing them to suffer a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what Su Ge showed today is exactly what they have been desperately needed for thousands of years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;枭 Silence for a few seconds and say: "I remain neutral."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lury looked at 枭At a glance, seriously warn: "I hope you can recognize your beliefs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing his eyes is full of sharpness: "I have a firm belief in my faith. This does not require you to remind me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, three people fall into silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, he screamed, "I must remind you, don’t keep staring at the knowledge in Su Ge’s mind and forget what he showed. Form."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, the two men suddenly looked gloomy and looked sullen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have seen many monsters, and have seen many mysterious people who have lost control, and even seen many people who have the ability to transform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three Archbishops are well aware that any change that wants to break away from human form carries serious risks and huge costs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing countless times of transformation, variability, loss of control, and any changes involving human form, none of them are completely positive, mixed with distortion, frenzy and A heavy price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have never seen such a perfect transformation, or evolution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The things that Su Ge’s form reveals give them a new understanding of the knowledge of morphological change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have previously confirmed that he has a secret profession, but it is only a job that is determined to be related to the sound system. I did not expect that he still has such a strong death. Knowledge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sages said: "Death knowledge, the two core elements of the bell, don't you think you heard it there?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The clock of the Abyss of the Abyss!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people think of it at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Archbishop of the March Church, they naturally know a lot of ancient secrets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Governor of Glen is one of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the rumor, in the ancient god war, the bell people and the cold kings who ruled the entire north wind continent, allegedly resisted the goddess of March and were finally suppressed by the three goddesses."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the legendary version they got. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The existence of the clockman seems to be very long, and it is long before the gods, there is no time for the dead in the world." The singer whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Laurie whispered: "There are many secret professions recorded in our church database, but this profession is the first time. From here you can see Before it came out, no one can inherit the power of the bell. After all, people can't get the inheritance directly from the gods. Can it be said that the bell is not dead?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "The Church of the Late Bells... The rumored bell-bearer is bound to appear in the late bells of death, can you say..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three people suddenly thought of it A terrible possibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "First report the incident to the Holy See, then discuss with the Holy Father about this clock, the undead seems to be holding the clock. People know very well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Larry said, the three archbishops then dispersed, each doing their own work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side, in the cave on the cliff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge and Erha walked in, just to see Hills, Vigania, and others gathered here, before the empty caves were very Lively and full of popularity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not injured!?" Hills hurried to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly and said, "Nothing, just consume a lot of psionic power, and no injuries."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss has recovered almost now, and asked: "What is the attitude of the church in March?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Still as before, Self-sustaining and confident," Su Ge replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sneer at the mouth of Gerlos: "It's almost the same as I estimated."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But it's not without any gains, experienced these events, the hearts of those clergymen It will surely fall into chaos and vibration, and even lead to suspicion. The Fortress and the Elves will stand directly on our side. So even if the church is completely wanted in March, we will not fall to the extent that everyone is shouting. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people listened to the deep agreement and nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They don’t plan to put themselves at the same level as the cult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, they must also show their strength and positioning. They are very different from those of the Institute of Polar Studies and the Cold Church. Good feelings and help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Randall asks: "What should I do next?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge sinks Said: "The next battle is very dangerous. I can't give up this goal after this step. Then our main battlefield is in the ancient city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Do you need us to go in?" At this time, two people came over and asked, and the expression was a bit eager to try. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas’s mission was very good. Although he didn’t know what Vanas and the two of them said, he could obviously feel it. The enthusiasm and loyalty of these two master witches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pair of eyes filled with eagerness and enthusiasm can not be put out by anyone alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg said in a deeper way: "The situation inside is very complicated, the people who enter must have strong patience and resilience, and the will must be very firm."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, Su Ge looked at two people: "And at this stage, the witch is not suitable for entering, because your essence is connected to the city, if the whisper appears again, If you have problems because you are too close, then you are in trouble."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear this, the two people suddenly remembered the weakness of their previous strange voices. time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Randall said excitedly: "I can go in!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded: "Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Jerez here seriously said: "I am still not convenient at this stage, I can take the other witches temporarily outside, we are always in touch through the seal, if you are attacked by the church, we will soon Arrived."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg heard some unexpected things, but did not ask what the reason was, nodded slightly: "Yes, I and Randall first Going and seeing the situation, Master Gerlos took the rest of the people and Lobo to stay outside the city. I don't want to put all the troops into one-off, because the next battle will be very long, and we must have enough backhand. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the previous two battles, Su Ge has decided to enter here, the small and fine team is more flexible and practical than those large forces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Frost tempted asks: "What is our purpose this time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge Extend the palm of your hand and say tightly: "Nature is the Holy Grail of the Soul!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;! ! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, the two witches suddenly opened their eyes and their faces were incredible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Holy Grail! The legendary Holy Grail is the artifact of the gods, and our mortals are not qualified to take it up," Sonic said shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary myths about the Holy Grail on the entire continent are inexhaustible, and the interpretation of the Holy Grail is also varied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people think that the Holy Grail can make people immortal, and some people want to reach the roots through the Holy Grail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people hope to summon the historical figures of the past through the Holy Grail, gain great knowledge, and know the secrets of the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone also regards the Holy Grail as an energy that can never be used, and is eager to realize the dream of perpetual motion through the Holy Grail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Grail is different in everyone's mind, and the ability to express it is not the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
