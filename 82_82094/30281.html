			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After eating and drinking, the two skinny girls were wearing cotton coats, sitting on the floor with a small blush, and a happy face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To eat, warmth is already the greatest happiness for them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge feels like this goes down and asks: "If the witch is not using power, can others see it?"<br /><br /> Older Hills shook his head and said, "No, the witch usually doesn't have any obvious difference with other people. Grace, if you have to say something special, the hair color of the witch." And the color of the pupil is more abundant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why are you hiding?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bernice explained: "We were found to be a witch and quickly escaped, but the church people got our portraits through the people around us. Now the night watchers, the hunters, the gods and the exorcists should all There is our portrait."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge heard this and nodded, then noticed in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He heard two new words, the sinner and the exorcist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge indulged and said: "Now my situation here is not stable, I can't help you for the time being. You are hiding here for a while now, I want to find a way. Let you live a normal life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, the two girls were very excited and thanked Yulin for saying, "Thank you!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the three men spoke, Su Ge’s ear suddenly heard other voices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!" Su Ge was able to listen to his fingers and ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug has mastered the knowledge of the voice beyond ordinary people, and the ability to perceive the sound has not been improved, not through the ears, but through mystery, that is Psom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two witches are stunned at this moment, but they are still obedient and even slow down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the blur, Su Ge heard two footsteps about 50 meters from here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Real? Is there a beautiful little girl on the ground? Chuck, you better not lie to me, but then you are very clear." The mad voice sounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other one said with a flattering and wretched voice: "You can rest assured, Mr. Louis, absolutely you like the type, no more than twenty years old, although dirty A little bit, but I can see that the skin is very white and looks good. You bring it back to wash and wash it with a beautiful sap."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rough sound Mr. Louis heard a burst of laughter after listening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This voice, the name, is the fat fat police officer in charge of this neighborhood." Su Ge thought of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Louis is a full-fledged bastard who often extorts small traders, beats tramps, and indecent women. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But because his sister has a good skin, it is a famous social flower in the upper class, and many things have been suppressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The residents around him hate and fear him, and stay away from it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this Su Ge turned and whispered, "Have you been found here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The two people shook their heads suddenly, and then Hills thought of what he said: "Right! At dusk we went to the garbage bin to find a candle for the ceremony, met a tramp, he was against me. Some wretched smiles and left."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge looked down at the shabby candle on the magical array, clenched his fist and said: "Absolutely not let them two "There are successes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Does he find us?" Hills looked white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly and succinctly said the two people just talked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two girls did not panic after listening, but they were very calm, and they were already used to this life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hills stood up and said, "I am going to drive them away. I can't let the apostles adults be exposed!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug raised his hand and stopped her and said, "No. You will be exposed in this way. Recently, the limelight is very tight, and you have been arrested in such a way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benedict flashed in his eyes at this moment A trace of cold said: "If this is the case, then kill them!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge looked at Bernice with some surprise and waved: "Return If you can't get that step, give it to me first!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, Sug took a stone and stood on the steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! Snapped! Snapped! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stone hits the steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the eruption of the percussion, Su Ge slowly released his psionic power through his own knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge uses his own mysterious knowledge to generate some resonance through the connection and contact of the sound, so that the two outsiders who are ready to come close can hear some unspeakable the sound of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the voice of the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside, wearing a blue cotton police coat, a fat policeman like a ball is led by a thin, thin and tramp Come along. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How far is it?" Louis said irritably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wanderer called Chuck said with a smile: "It’s in front, it’s coming soon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;Snapped! Snapped! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, two people heard the sound of a few stones coming from the front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chuck is happy to say: "Just there! Just there!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Louis After listening to the body, I was gradually excited, and the body that was filled with fat was trembled and accelerated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He could already think of the two poor little girls squatting underneath themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two people who have not taken two steps, and the sound of the stone tapping in the ear turns into a very incomprehensible sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound cannot be described as if it is the friction of something in the process of squeezing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This squeezing sound is extremely harsh, making people feel dizzy and disgusting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and this kind of voice doesn't know why it makes people feel a fierce tremor in the soul, as if the sound is behind an unspeakable horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! Ah! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along with a scream, two people’s eyes widened, their mouths opened, their saliva drooled, their horror was screaming, they were flustered, and even rolled. The climb turned and ran, leaving only clutter on the white snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the basement, Su Ge’s face is white, but more is happy and relaxed: “Get it.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time, the effect is much better than the Su Ge imagination. For ordinary people, the sound of this soul is almost deadly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope that you can raise some of the vision because of this thing, and then let those monsters kill you." Although Su Ge is not an abomination, but for This kind of bully that bullies the small citizens is still abhorrent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn't mind hurting them, or even ruining the life of these scum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The side of Hills and Bernice saw the shock of this face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They didn’t know what was going on, but they clearly heard the two people outside were full of horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The apostle is not an apostle of my Lord, it is so powerful!" Hills thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two mysterious abilities, but there is no mysterious knowledge. There is no concept for these. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
