			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, this thin blood-hunter has no room for resistance in Su Ge's hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment Suger’s hand held his neck, powerful vibration knowledge was applied to his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shock of terror has completely lost control of his body's bones and muscles, and even the psionics have been shaken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this means, Bart’s stunned question: “The expert mystery, is this solved?”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge squats on the neck of the blood-hunter, which is like a blood-stained blood-stained person who is on the ground like a muddy shackle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then how do you want to solve it? The high-end mystery is a matter of moments, it may be a look, or it may be a gesture. This is what you told My." Su Ge said, reaching out and taking a picture on Mary, then Mary's body suddenly returned to normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly turned and hugged Su Ge, thankfully said: "Thank you! Thank you, my hero."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s body is a bit stiff and smiles and says: “You haven’t taken me to play the city of Hui Yao.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary knows the measure After holding it, she let go of her hand and touched the tears on her face. She said with concern: "What about this cultist?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge There is no good feeling for this perverted blood-hunter. First, tell Bart to take Mary first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After two people left, Su Ge did not intend to stay for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The condescending look of the blood-hunter faintly asked: "How do you want to die?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the blood-hunter was hit hard at this time, the consciousness was still clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Heterodox, you have been contaminated with the smell of my blood, the goddess' servant will soon find you. In the future, you will be tragically killed in the blood "The blood catcher's voice is hoarse threat." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The threat of this threat, Su Ge, was tired of listening, and said faintly: "That would scare you to death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, the deep and heavy night clock followed When it rings, the invisible power acts on the spirit of the blood-hunter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few seconds, after a fierce scream and convulsion, the man’s face was completely blue, and even the soul completely dissipated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweeping around the situation, after detailed cover by the Holy Grail of the Soul, confirming that no suspicious traces were left, Su Ge quietly left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When returning to the front yard, I found that the party had reached a climax. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Music has come to mind, people have started real carnival. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary's acting is really good. At this time, she seems to have not encountered anything, and a few noble ladies are talking and laughing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart and Duke are also talking about things in the relevant circles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger is finally able to sit alone and watch everyone, in the hope of finding some useful clues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not very interested in the Grail document, he only wants to find the ghoul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, after watching it for a while, Su Ge still found no suspicious traces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Su Ge was ready to leave home, he was stopped by the ancient consciousness who did not know where it came from. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is gone?" asked Gu Xiaoxiao. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge spread his hand: "It’s boring not to sit here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" You are really not interested in the Holy Grail?" asked Gu Jue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge casually said: "I am interested in interest, but I feel that I am still a little far away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" asked Gu Ju. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded: "It’s quite far, there are some signs that the Holy Grail will be born. It’s just a holy grail document, it’s naturally far away.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gujue handed a glass of wine to Su Ge, and two people found a place where a relatively small number of people sat down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For the Holy Grail, you should know a lot of things?" asked Gu Jue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded and said, "How much is known, including the type and quantity of the Holy Grail."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gu Jue sighed and drank the wine and said: "The Holy Grail of the Church of the Holy Blood is the holy grail of wisdom in the seven holy cups."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Holy Grail of Wisdom !?" Su Ge also knew this message for the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gu Jue continues to say: "The Holy Grail of wisdom represents the source of wisdom in the world, and there are countless knowledges in it. These are also the scientific and technological levels of the Church of the Holy Blood. The church has to be much higher."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Su Ge recalls the blood treatment of the Church of the Holy Blood, the flying steel battleship, the holy can be assembled at any time. Blood Cathedral, these things are really not what these people can think of now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So is the Holy Grail document here and the Holy Grail of wisdom?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ancient sense nodded: "Of course, the current situation, the closure of the Holy Blood Maze is because the Holy Grail of wisdom seems to have problems."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge did not say much, he now got the message of the closure of the Holy Blood Maze in many ways, but the results are completely different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The godfather of Water, who is a maze guard, said that the blood maze may have collapsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emeria said that the reason for the closure of the Holy Blood Maze was because the Holy Swords went out of the abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, the reason for Guju said is that there is a problem with the Holy Grail of wisdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These three answers do not know who to say to Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone said it makes sense, so that Su Ge can't judge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can't see, you are still interested in the Holy Grail." Su Ge looked at the ancient smile and said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gu Jue sighed: "No one can resist the temptation of the Holy Grail, because that represents one of the origins of the world. But I know very well what horrible things. So I don't have much desire for the Holy Grail."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you say to me?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gu Xiaoxiao’s answer: “Nature is to let you go to the Holy Grail.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Why me?" Su Ge asked quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ancient feelings touched the chin and looked at Su Ge: "I see you face, you know, you are a big man."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge whispered: "These things can't lie to me, tell the truth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The previous doomsday theory, Do you remember?" Gu Jue suddenly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When the world comes, human wisdom should not be in the hands of those people. The kind that can open up a new civilization, there should be a peace of mind." In the hands of the people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you sure that the end will come?" Su Ge asked quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it was before, he was still skeptical about the doomsday theory of Gu Ju. But last night, after reading "Three Nights Before Creation", he suddenly discovered that the theory of ancient consciousness must be based on it. It is definitely not a hole in the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ancient sense looked up at the three moons in the sky: "It will come."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “How come?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
