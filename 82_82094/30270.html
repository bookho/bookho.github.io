			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After dinner, the three brothers simply said the situation and went back to sleep in the bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These days, Winnie and Black were scared to sleep, and now Su Ge is back safely, and the nervousness of the two people relaxes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg's bedroom is not large, about twenty square meters. Very simple in the house, a single bed, a desk, a chair, a wardrobe, a coat rack, nothing else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Undressing, too tired, Su Ge did not take a bath, and fell asleep on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calling...嗷呜呜......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know if it’s a dream or an illusion, sleeping In the middle of Suger, he heard the sound of the wind and the screaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Su Ge opened his eyes and found himself sitting on a boat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The size of the ship is very large, at least 50 meters long, and it looks like a battleship in the age of the nautical, but at this time the whole ship was surprised by the white cold live. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the ice, Su Ge can see that the broken ship is very worn, the wooden deck, the hull is full of holes left by the years. The towering three masts are empty and you can't see the sails. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The link between the mast and the hull of the hull is smashed in the air, just like the ghost ship in the movie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scene makes Su Ge very suspicious, if it is not the ship is frozen by white frost, there is even the risk of disintegration at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where is this?" Su Ge frowned and looked around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found that the dense fog around me could not see anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! Boom! Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he heard the thick bells, which were behind Su Ge and also in the middle of the boat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning back and turning back, Su Ge found that there was a temple in the middle of the ghost ship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole body is dark, as if it were made of obsidian. It is sturdy and gives a feeling of heavy sin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thick bells are still coming out of the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bell has an inexplicable attraction for Su Ge, and he instinctively stepped toward the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temple occupies a large area of ​​the ghost ship, and Su Ge comes to the door of the temple in two steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking up, the temple structure is divided into three layers, forming the shape of a trapezoidal pyramid, one layer smaller than one layer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the bottom of the third floor, there is a quaint bell tower, and the middle of the bell tower is blurred to see a big black clock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound is sent from there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Su Gewan was like a magical obstacle, his eyes flashed with strange blue light, and he walked into the temple with a sluggish step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The internal structure of the temple is very empty, the altar at the bottom of the hall can not see the altar, can not see the image. There is only a spiral spire-shaped suspended seat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These seats are centered on a certain point and form a four-story stepped seat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This seat is very elegant, the first floor is the lowest position, the black seat is a huge wolf head embossed on the back of the chair. There are 12 seats. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second layer is about a half meter above the primary level, and there are a lot of sinuous patterns on the seat. The seat back is a soldier's embossed with heavy metal armor and weapons, with eight seats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is worth noting that the weapons of the eight warriors are different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are giant swords, daggers, giant axes, bows and arrows, mortars, hammers, machetes, and gloves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third floor is half a meter higher than the second floor, and the seats are more refined with ice blue lines. The back of the chair is a majestic rider riding a horse, with four seats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These four knights look different and seem to represent different identities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether wearing a cloth armor with a staff; wearing a robes with a sickle; wearing a heavy armor, holding up the hoe; the whole body is burning with flames, holding a long scorpion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The highest point above the four seats is a huge throne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The throne is very delicate, two handrails are engraved with beautiful cloud-like reliefs, the base under the throne, and the three different forms of giant wolf Act as a step and a foot pad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The throne's back of the throne goes straight to the apex of the temple, and there are twelve huge black wings on both sides. These twelve wings are very large and extend just right. It constitutes the dome of the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the wings, carved countless undead, galloping wolves, knights in armor, galloping horses, and standing in front, holding a hand A spear, riding a giant wolf, the king with a mask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge Muran looked at this weird structure, then climbed up the seat in this circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he climbed to the edge of the throne, he groaned, but did not sit up. The huge wings that stretched out along the back of the king's seat came to the top of the temple, the position of the bell tower that sounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big clock is still making a thick voice, but nothing hits him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dark clock, a silver spear was inserted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This spear is about two meters long, from the top left side of the big clock, and slanted from the bottom of the right side, as if throwing this spear People, the purpose is to pierce this big clock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge stood silent and took a hand to the left of the big clock and held the silver spear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咔咔咔......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the moment of holding, the horrible ice spreads along the hand of Su Ge to the silver spear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge slammed hard, accompanied by a squeaky squeak, and the two-meter-long spear was pulled out by him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind blows louder, and the sky is thundering like a storm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, it rains, but when it appears in his vision, it instantly turns into a snowflake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚咚咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bell becomes more sturdy and deeper at this time, and this sound seems to spread throughout the world without dissipating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Sugg jumped down and held the spear with a precise jump to the throne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the activity, Su Ge stepped on the steps of the three giant wolves to the throne and slowly sat up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bell is louder, and countless fogs come in and bury it here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the gray temple, only a pair of ice blue eyes flashed past, and then calmed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge suddenly did it, and he found himself sweating, as if he had just come out of the oven. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! Boom! Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the city center, the bell of the Church of the Holy Blood has been heard six times, representing the early morning, and the new day begins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Amazing dreams, and good truths." Su Ge clearly remembered all the details of the entire dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The body seems to recover some." Su Ge thought about taking a physical activity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he feels his left arm is a bit heavy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
