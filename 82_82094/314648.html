			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at Hayden, who was fainting, Suge breathed a sigh of relief, bending over his leg and dragging it toward the alley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just halfway through, the headaches became more intense, and Sug’s eyes couldn’t help but twitch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, Randall arrived in time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not take the carriage, but flew directly with his servant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five servants brought him two at this time, and after appearing in the shadow of the side, Randall rushed to help Su Ge: "The Pope "Are you okay?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Geqiang endured the pain, his expression faintly said: "Nothing, this body is too weak."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Su Ge wants to show his strength as a pope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not that your strength is not good, but that your body is too weak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Randall was in the flicker of Su Ge before, and it was faintly thought that the Pope’s majesty definitely did not belong to this world, but came through some kind of ritual. The magical existence in this body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this sentence, he did not hesitate, but more determined the conjecture in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two servants behind him quickly took over Hayden’s body, and Randall said shockally: “This is an expert-level necromancer. You have dealt him with this weak body? It is a powerful Pope."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not flattering, but the truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Randall's view, Su Ge's body is still at the professional level, no matter the psionic power, the mysterious control is far lower than the mysterious world. average of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this is a weak body, actually killed this necromancer who is close to the master, which makes Randall very shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you look at the overall attributes of the body alone, this fainting necromancer is more than three times the size of the Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s reluctant question: “Do you think this is the level I should be?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "The believers don't dare!" Randall said quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two men and a woman behind the waiter watching the master’s obedience and even fear of this weak man, and his heart is more confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is the owner's fear of him?" The two men looked at each other and saw the doubts in the other's eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the corner of the Hutong, after handing over the three bodies to Randall, Suge yelled at his forehead and said, "Don’t hurry, there are two on their side. In the carriage, there are acquaintances inside, and deal with them together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Randall nodded and said to the follower: "You two handle these three people, me and The Pope went down to see."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Master." The two said respectfully, and did not know where to take out a few bats. Skilled into the mouth of these three people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the bat sleeping three people's mouths crawling in, squirming in their necks and then entering the stomach, Sug does not know why not not feel sick, Instead, it feels very interesting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sure enough, my mentality is getting more and more abnormal." Su Ge is very self-aware, and clearly feels this subtle change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the carriage, the two members were somewhat restless at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishop has been away for ten minutes and still hasn’t returned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They just noticed a gunshot, which made them more worried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bishop, will not have an accident?" Mr. Arthur was pale and asked in a low voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Forlin immediately interrupted: "Impossible! How powerful the bishops are, you and I are obvious to all. They can even take back the mind of the broken mind and return to life. !"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking back at the scene I saw at the time, Mr. Arthur was a little bit in his heart and continued to wait patiently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After about two minutes, two people who bowed their heads and thoughts suddenly heard someone knocking on the door of the carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This suddenly made two people very happy and excited, and hurriedly looked up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the moment of looking up, the two people stood up in horror, huddled together in the corner of the carriage, pale, round eyes The middle is full of panic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four legs clenching couldn’t help but tremble as if they saw an unnamed monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the carriage, Su Ge’s face was pale, but he smiled at the two men and reached out to open the door. It was full of happiness, as if he had seen the old man who had not seen for a long time. Friends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey! Two distinguished members, we are really close and meet again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp God knows the psychological state of the two members at this time. When Su Ge tries to enter the carriage, the two men scream together and faint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge sat down and looked helplessly and turned around and asked: "Randall, am I so terrible?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Randall couldn’t help but smile: "You are certainly not terrible, but very handsome. Their narrow vision like an ant limits their thinking and makes them unable to understand." Your elegance and handsomeness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly and said: "It makes sense."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp After that, Randall and the two servants put Su Ge's spoils in the carriage, and the two attendants sat outside and drove to the palace quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the current state of Su Ge, it is impossible to continue the investigation. You can only take a day off and fight again tomorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sitting in the carriage, Randall sighed: "You are really thinking about it. Mill is still worried that these two guys are leaking. I didn't expect to be you." I got back so soon. When I go back, I see that he dare not continue to look down on you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge wants to say that this is a coincidence, but as the Pope's majesty makes him unable to say anything, he can only respond faintly: "The whole thing is in my hands."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Randall looked at Su Ge’s heart and sighed: “It’s not the Lord’s walk in the world, this calm and indifferent attitude, this gesture of controlling everything, only the kind of knowledge that knows a lot. Talent is owned."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the road, Su Ge did not say too much, and in most cases he was closing his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half an hour, the group returned to the palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Randall dragged the five men off the carriage, Irina and Mill were completely shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How did you find them both?" Mill looked up at Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge smiled a little: "It happened."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Su Ge said truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Mil does not believe it. At such a critical moment, you suddenly grabbed these two key spies, which happened to happen? There are so many things happening in the world! Mill thought in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illina looked at Su Ge’s pale face and knew that his aftereffects had been committed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where did you fight this time?" Elena asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After waiting for Sug to return, Randall pointed out and said: "An expert-level necromancer close to the master, and an expert-level necromancer Warlock."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illina jumped in her heart and turned her head to look at it. When she saw Hayden with blood on her face, she suddenly opened her eyes: "Hayden !?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge eyebrows pick up slightly: "Do you know!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ilay Na nodded sullenly: "This is the famous bishop of the death sect, the mysterious master of the entire northern kingdom!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
