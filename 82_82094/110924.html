			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard Ada’s words, Su Ge’s spirit shocked, and then hurriedly said: “Ada, are you planning to help those unidentified tramps to register? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ida nodded and said, "Well, if you have proof of identity, you can become a formal citizen. By then, as long as they are willing to work hard, they can certainly harvest." A beautiful tomorrow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Su Ge’s mind suddenly remembered Just Hills and Bernice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If this is the case, is it possible for them to register their identity together?" Su Ge’s heart suddenly became hot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ada smiled and looked at the contemplative Su Ge and asked: "You are a police detective. It is estimated that you will come into contact with some tramps. Please don't be harsh when you arrive." They, don't bother them. If you can, introduce them to me, I can help them find their destination."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Ada holds Su in both hands Ge said: "I know that your heart is kind, if you can, please help those poor people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge is full of brains at this time Hills and Bernice, laughing and talking, said: "You can rest assured, Ida. I will not let you down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is just the right, handing over Hills and Bernice to Ada, which not only makes Ada happy, but also greatly improves safety. After all, sending it from Ada can reduce the probability of suspicion. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, the mood that was previously disturbed by the Green Flame Brotherhood suddenly eased. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the meal, the two people are ready to go out after cleaning up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, Ada. Lobo followed up to investigate the matter. I found out yesterday that he has the potential to become a police dog." Su Ge said with a glove. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ada smiled happily after listening, and hugged him and said, "Haha, really? That's great."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Erha had already had a good impression on Aida, and he was enjoying it after being held by Ada. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can make animals so close to you, Ada, you are a natural saint." Su Ge sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ada slowly stood up, wearing a radiant piece of plain, classical beauty, saying: "I think that everything in the world has goodness, humanity, Insects, beasts, and even plants. As long as they are good at heart and bright inside, I will treat all beings equally."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment of hearing this, Su I don’t know if it’s an illusion, and I feel a glimmer of light on Ada’s body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong with you?" Ada saw Su Ge and asked with concern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled and shook his head and took the second Harobo out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This ideal, this holy, I will desperately guard." On the way, Su Ge squeezed his fist and said hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!" The second side of the second suddenly called. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge looked a glimpse, then touched his chin and said: "Desperately, forget your own life. I will work hard. To protect this kind of good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city today is calm, at least looks calm, snow is cleared and piled up on the side of the road, people are wearing thick The coat, breathing in the mouth like a spit, speeding up the pace to get to the work unit, embrace the warm air of the fireplace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looked at these people and smiled. He had strong resistance to the cold for some reason, and now the temperature of minus 20 degrees is for him. There is no feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Su Ge’s mind suddenly remembered the situation in the morning, Hills and Bernice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The two of them should have received similar reinforcements. At that time, the temperature in the room was at least minus 30 degrees. However, they wore thin clothes without any discomfort. However, this is a bit strange."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge brows gradually lock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They said that the instinct tells them the blood of their beasts and relieves the coldness, which means that the beast's blood has the energy to resist the cold. This combined blood therapy It is not difficult to understand, because the blood of any creature in this world has hidden mysterious energy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But what is their instinct? Is it other? Ordinary people also have this talent?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And they used the meat and bones of the beasts to sacrifice, through which they helped them understand Mastering the power of oneself, but the question is coming. Who is the sacrifice for their sacrifice? I must have not received it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world is full of unknowns everywhere The strangeness, this kind of nonsense in the eyes of the earth, unrealistic sacrifices make Suge very jealous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because there is no useless sacrifice in this world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This thing has time to investigate, or my followers will go all out to give a sacrifice to a god that is completely unknown, and get it. My knowledge, then I can make a big loss." Su Ge made up his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Su Ge came to the police station, it was already lively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the files are being discussed, and some are discussing the case. Some people complain because they are helping others to adjust their disputes, and some are racking their brains because of a serial killer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big hall is full of bustle and vitality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First find a seat to sit down and take off the coat, then take out the silver pendant that is hugged by hand, and after thinking about it, turn to the master of Jerez The temporary office went. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knocking on the door, Gerlos’s unique voice came through the door: "Enter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Then Su Ge walked in, just to see Jellos looking at a letter with a pipe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Recovering is pretty good." After seeing Su Ge, Gerlos put down the letter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
