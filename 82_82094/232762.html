			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At two o'clock in the afternoon, Su Ge returned to the Cathedral of the Holy Blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just came back and put the equipment down, the doorbell rang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge’s heart suddenly jumped and squeezed his cane to open the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I thought you didn't come back!" Father Anthony outside the door said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Father Anthony, Suge breathed a sigh of relief and asked him to come in and ask: "How come I have time today?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The recent cities are relatively peaceful, except for the few priests who are busy, we are all idle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Recently more peaceful?" Su Ge’s heart screamed twice, followed by a smile: "It’s really peaceful recently."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father Anthony Sit down Say: "Your first mission is very good, the mission department is very high on you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the recent period, you can't learn it!" Su Ge laughed. Father Anthony nodded and sighed: "Your learning ability is really strong. This is not, the bishop looks at you and is ready to continue to arrange for you to study."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey? Continue learning? What does the bishop mean?" Su Ge felt a move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Anthony nodded: "There has been a lot of peace in recent times, so it is estimated that you have no job at all. In order not to let you ruin this time, the bishop will give you I have customized a set of courses with a few new people and I want you to learn."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, Father Anthony whispered in a mysterious voice: "I heard There is a big move after a month, you are the main person at that time, so this month should focus on improving."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What does he mean?" Thinking in the heart, he immediately asked: "Where is the place of study? Who learns?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The location is an independent area of ​​the medical district, which is the best study area of ​​the whole church, with incomparably sound facilities. On the teacher side, the bishop has followed my advice, with Ivan as the main teacher and a combat coach. A gunman and a Gaelic officer will instruct you to strengthen the teaching of the priest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gail's priest!" Su Ge's heart sank to the bottom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony said with envy: "There are very few clergy who can have this kind of treatment, even though this month is a closed-door study." But you have to hold on. After waiting this month, you will definitely complete a thorough qualitative change!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One month? One day after one month is still one day Bloodmoon Festival. Damn! They should be afraid of the mysterious person who hurt the black man and dare not touch me, but because I found the key clues to be under house arrest!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Su Ge is anxious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What should I do? If I can, I can only leave now!" Suguez immediately got up and said: "Yes, I think of one thing, Need to talk to Ada, I am going back home now, come back at night!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge said, take Luobo and walk out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey! Don't worry!" Anthony hurriedly followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where are you going?" At this time, Father Gail walked with Ivan from afar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled and said: "There are some things at home, go back and deal with it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gail The priest is still as indifferent as usual: "What can be more important than the bishop's charter? There is something for Father Anthony to help you with. This kind of learning opportunity is only one or two times a year, every quarter of an hour. Don't delay, let's go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Su Ge’s heart flashed an anger, and he couldn’t wait to smoke his sour face. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the next second, Su Ge calms down: "Now resistance is not the best result, I am gone without an official, but Ada, Ivan, etc. People will definitely be attacked, even if Luke’s help is too thin. Since it is imprisoned, I am not afraid to kill me. Then I will let Randall and Adeline come back with Hills and Bernice as soon as possible. When they arrive, even if they rush out, it is not a problem to go far."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Su Ge smiled and said: "If this is the case, let's go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing that Sug promised, Gaelic officer flashed a sneer : "Go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half an hour, when Su Ge walked into a relatively closed courtyard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The compound is large in size, with a small church and three small two-story buildings, arranged like a courtyard house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sugg looked around and determined the path to escape and rest assured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivan is a little scared about this place, has been leaning on Su Ge, his face is not very good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Find your own room, adapt to the environment and configuration here, and officially begin tomorrow." Gael said loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a total of five trainees in this batch, and there are four new clerics besides Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger followed the instructions to find his room on the second floor of the chapel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first use of Keynes runes to lay out an isolated mysterious array to ensure that the entire room is safe and come up with a small red crystal ring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is Luke’s enchantment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After injecting the psionic energy, Su Ge said the current experience, and added: "If this continues, I can't use the night clock to help you suppress." Animal nature."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red crystal ring then turns into a drop of thick blood and disappears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After ten minutes, it appeared again from the ground, bringing Luke’s reply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can use the night clock on this, I can hear it. Your location is not remote, I can go anytime. But I suggest you temporarily Patience, I don't want to go to the Church of the Holy Blood until the emergency. I will help you monitor the situation outside, you don't have to worry too much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon hearing this, Su Ge did not continue to reply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Things have come here, they have been unable to resist, and they can only wait and see here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you can't stop it, don't stop it, time will come with Ada running." Su Ge thought of a bachelor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he soon found himself unable to go to that heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mao Monkey Jack, strong Roland, cute and introverted Ivan, dedicated Anthony Father, lively Julie Sister, steady Mr. Rogan, love dog The person Marx, the clever Bobby, let Su Ge watch these people die and become sacrifices, Su Ge can't bear it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Taking a deep breath, Su Ge calmed himself down through meditation: "It’s useless to think about it now, always think about it, if it’s really The city is in chaos, and the Church of the Holy Blood is corrupt. At that time, it was the time for our late church to make a name. It was just by saving people to express the positive image of the church and stand at the commanding heights of morality."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If this is the case, I need to let Adeline prepare the masks and church badges for the action."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entering the night, Su Sitting on the throne and uniting the whole thing together, I decided that I was the safest choice to study here in the present situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "According to today's intelligence analysis, they will continue to improve the squad, have a framework of the arsenal, form a content through the macro worm as a rune. So huge The law of the squad is definitely to sacrifice all the cities. The sacrifice of this scale and the connection between them, the black man wants to summon the gauze and nicholas. The simple sacrifice and energy. Not enough to support, so they chose to summon on the Blood Festival, which indirectly, the night of the Blood Festival will have the original energy of horror to provide energy for the squad. It is really a good time! Everyone is hiding in the Blood Festival. If you don't go out at home, you can get a huge energy supply while ensuring privacy and security."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The black man should now try to cure himself The injury, at the same time, will find a way to deal with the person who injured him. Injury him once, and now counts how to get rid of the opposite, that is to say, the strong who beat him is not perfect, the power has many restrictions , . Black people are always looking for opportunities to "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;</div>
