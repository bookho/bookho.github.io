			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After about five minutes, Shelly asked: "What other news?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Suge also briefly said Luke’s information related to Safiro’s Star Desert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley listened, and suddenly said: "The guy has nothing to do with you, don't think too much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know Him?" Su Ge asked unexpectedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not know, just because of some special relevance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Su Ge didn't ask much, hugged her shoulder and said, "Sleep, the news is about to spread, and the good show is about to begin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hausman family House. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyone’s eyes were calm and the expression was peaceful and he found himself still in the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time there are more than a dozen bodies lying in the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These bodies were just their companions in the near future, when they all turned into dead bodies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body does not appear to have any scars, but the soul has long been fragmented and will disappear into the world forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the body of the companion, the female warlock did not have any other expressions, and the face was peaceful. Glan asked with respect to Kass: "The deputy bishop, pick up What should we do next?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cass has already prepared for it, "You can go out tonight at night, I will let our people send you to A safe place. You can live there for a while and calm your inner wounds. You can't get into the city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of female warlocks There is no violation at all, respectful obedience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke has some concerns: "What should I do with these bodies?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kas smiled: "Reassured, I have a way to deal with it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The seemingly calm night passed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning's darkness seems to make people feel depressed. It seems that something bad is going to happen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Merris House. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire house is covered by busyness and grief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the big bedroom, the top of the female warlock’s top is very bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the core troops sent out last night have no news at all, it seems to have disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With them, there is Archbishop Salou and Archbishop Laurie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Archbishop, what is the situation?" asked an old temper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no expression in the labor: "There is no abnormality in the Hausmann House, and there is no evidence of any person. The more than 20 people you sent, It has completely evaporated."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is impossible!" Hearing this, several old gods were shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the twenty-eight people, led by a master female warlock, thirteen expert mysteries, this is already a mysterious power. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can such a huge force suddenly disappear without warning, and humans evaporate? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the female warlocks were sluggish, Archbishop Saru said coldly: "Then you don't need to be responsible for other things, concentrate on the work at hand." Ok. The situation outside is not related to you, we will deal with it well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When heard such orders, the female warlocks suddenly pale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means depriving them of all the relationships and rights in the capital, putting them under house arrest and turning them into tools for cultivating gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, they are no longer qualified to resist and negotiate, and they can only accept everything silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving the Duke of Merris, the two archbishops were not very good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because they found out that Su Ge’s power here is out of their expectations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A master, thirteen expert mysteries, a number of professional mysteries, such power is a powerful force in any city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they are evaporating under the eyes of their eyes, which makes the two people extremely vigilant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We need to speed up the process. I can feel the power of the church here is growing!" Saru clenched his fist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Laurie agreed to nod: "The next step, starting this evening."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grass Marquis Manor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green was a little excited after hearing his report. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His speed is a bit too fast." Green sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside him, the head of the Holy Knights, Coase listened and marveled at the execution of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last night, the mysterious man of the church in the late bells found two people, hoping that two people could help the church in the evening clock to send the 18 female warlocks to the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time as the conditions, the powerful mysterious man also said that the late bell church had destroyed the system of the female warlocks in the capital, and the leader, Ms. Mei, did not die. It is also not far from death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time I heard this, Green did not believe it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, this speed is too fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the day and Su Ge just finished, act at night? And directly destroy the decapitation of the dagger? This is simply unbelievable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the two people heard the inside of the Duke of Merris, they completely believed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader was seriously injured and died. The core combatants died halfway and were advised to drop by half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole female warlock's system suddenly collapsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What should I do with those bodies?" Green couldn't make up his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of any mysterious person is a precious asset, especially the master mystery who has a secret profession. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yesterday the mysterious man gave them the free whites, which was regarded as the reward for the delivery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Coase confidently said: "Give it to me. Your Majesty will be very interested in this master class."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, it’s not just Green that is shocked, there are many other forces hidden in the dark, even including Albert who investigates ghosts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evening church is too mysterious, no one knows what its true strength is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even many people think that the power of the church in the late bell is blown out by rumors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this time, I immediately made everyone have great vigilance and jealousy about the church in the late bell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the initiator of everything, Su Ge is walking on the street at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl did not come out with her, because at this special time, the family must be guarded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge does not want to experience the kind of person who is important to be taken away, and to turn back to his own boring bridge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you look at the weather, you know that today is definitely a disaster-ridden day." Su Ge looked at the dark clouds in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now he comes to the Ten Victory Gate to find Father Sini, because in the next few cases, he needs to cooperate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Father Sini is still wearing an old robe and leaning on a chair with a worn long sword. It looks like a decadent tramp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yesterday's movement is not small." After meeting, Father Sini said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded: "I was watching it at the time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you going to do?" ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have done something through my network, and from today on, there will be some things that are not too peaceful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not too flat?" Father Sini's murky eyes flashed a glimmer of light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge added: "Of course, these non-flat things will appear on the cultists you hate."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Listening to this, Father Sini immediately squinted: "That's not bad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition, I want to know some of today's capitals The situation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is there any special happening in the city recently? The cult ritual? Or other sacrifices?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French Sini shook his head affirmatively: "No, what happened?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I got some news, there are some visions in the Star Desert of the Elf Order, some not very good visions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Father Sini immediately sat up straight and his eyes opened and looked at Su Ge: "Your worry makes me feel gratified. At the same time, thank you for your reminder, I will pay attention to this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;Farewell to Father Sini, a slow walk in the capital. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He needs to be familiar with the situation of the whole city and the configuration of mysterious personnel. Otherwise, if there are other situations and the key moments are lost, then it will be embarrassing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going along the street slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Near noon, after walking for three and a half hours, Su Ge, who had returned to God, looked at the scenery around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After rethinking, I found out that this is the strongest psychic, the east side of Myra’s clinic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the street to the main entrance, Su Ge met a young man with a pale face and a gloomy expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the youth's appearance, it can be seen that his body is very bad, and belongs to the kind of weakness of the body hollowed out by the wine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man smiled a little after seeing Su Ge, and then both of them turned and walked into Myra’s clinic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You please first." The voice of the youth is a bit blunt, it seems that foreigners are talking about the language of Berant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge thought he was a foreigner and smiled and said: "You please, please see that your status is much worse than me."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man said a thank you and listened to the first visit to the Myra clinic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are not many people at the Myra clinic today. It seems that her cure rate is really good. People who have been cured rarely see a doctor again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the two young people were sent away, the idle Myra went downstairs and picked up the mop to clean up, just to see Su Ge and the youth coming in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the arrival of Su Ge, Myra did not refuse, nor did she drive away, but first asked the youth: "Where is it uncomfortable?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man looked at Mela at the moment and swallowed his mouth and said, "A beautiful woman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;When I heard this, Melaton was dark and pale, and said in a bad tone: "I don't welcome you here, please leave immediately."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
