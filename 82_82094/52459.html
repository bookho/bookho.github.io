			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Bart is not an ordinary person, Su Ge did not report this matter directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the one hand, Su Ge’s thinking is not the same as other people. He has his own unique values ​​in this black and white world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Green Flame Brotherhood was confirmed as a cult, Bart’s feeling for him was not bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, he wants to confirm his purpose and conduct through these two days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, there are two months worth of work money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even if you grab it, let me make a small profit and say it!" Su Ge thought of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I came back through Mr. Parker’s bakery, Sugg looked down at the 1 gram in his hand and thought about it or walked in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"French Sotos? How come you? I’m so thankful to you.” Mr. Parker, who is finishing the bread, said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled and said: "You are welcome, you and me are the people of the goddess of March, I am the goddess of the goddess, it is a matter of course to help my compatriots." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parker said with a happy sigh: "If all clergy can be like you, then the world will be incomparably beautiful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your compliment." Su Ge said, he handed over the 1 lang that he had just received and said, "Give me two buttered breads, two Big."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Su Ge, the creamy bread luxury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a dessert made from a soft, soft white bread with a thick creamy cream in the middle. The palate is soft and smooth, and the taste is delicious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two large portions of bread, one about half a catty, and the price can reach 20 cents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bread is already more than a meal for three people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parker laughed very loudly after listening to it, rubbed his hand and took the money, turned and skillfully used a good white carton to fill the two points. The creamy white bread was packed and handed to Sug and smiled: "I believe this bread can make your girlfriend happy for a few days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parker I thought these two breads were bought by Su Ge for my girlfriend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled and did not explain, after taking two boxes and change, Parker gave himself 65 cents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good people always get lucky luck, Sotos priest." Parker said with a smile, a round smile on his face. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I got home at night, Sug just saw Winnie just coming back prepare for dinner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled and said, "Come to Winnie, give you and Black's gift."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Gift?" Black squatted on the sofa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winnie’s white box opened and she suddenly stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sug, this is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug does not dare to tell the truth: "Today I helped the Parker boss in the bakery solve a critical problem, give me a coupon, and only need 20 cents to buy these two delicious buttered breads."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Su Ge added: "And I was lucky. I found a part-time translator today, helping a businessman from the Allied Empire to translate. I have a daily salary of 1 kr. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wennie bowed her head and smelled the creamy bread, whispering her mouth, and turned to grab a piece of bread that Black was ready to eat. It’s eating money!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she said, Winnie turned and said, “I went to the kitchen to separate the cream from the bread. The delicious white bread can be used as a dinner, with gray. Bread is eaten. I store it first and use it as a seasoning when making bacon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Su Ge opened his mouth and tried to stop, but did not say anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black licked the cream that had just been scraped off with his fingertips. The happiness of his face said: "Brother, thank you."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next two days of vacation time, Su Ge is not idle, every day with Bart hanging in the city of Bain. From his behavior, Su Ge found that he was a real businessman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His main purposes are financial streets, terminals, companies, factories, and newspapers and post offices. I even went to the city transportation center because he wanted to invest in the construction of a locomotive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Bart’s eyes, there are business opportunities everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two days of pleasant and easy contact, the two established a good relationship, although the profession is different, but because of the desire for knowledge, there are many common topic of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, Bart. The two days of happiness ended like this. I am going to work tomorrow." At dusk, Su Ge wanted Bart to bid farewell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart is still trying to say: "I really hope that you can resign as my professional translator, so I will have a lot here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug said with a smile: "This idea is very tempting, but unfortunately, you are one step late."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Bart said with a smile: "For businessmen, there is no opportunity to exchange sooner or later. There is only an exchange of interests. When we agree on each other's needs, I believe we will have very happy cooperation."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, then I am very much looking forward to it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bat squinted and said, "Be careful on the road, if If you have any questions, feel free to come to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge didn't think too much, smiled and nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the farewell, Su Ge walked toward the home along the Kaixuan Road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touching the two 1 gram of banknotes in his pocket, Su Ge’s heart said: “This way Winnie can be a little easier.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boom! Boom! ......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The six bells sounded, the sky was completely dark, and the streetside streetlights slowly lit up with the sparks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time as the three moons appear in the sky, the snowflake with large goose feathers slowly falls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug stands on the corner of the street, looking at the falling snow through the lights, with neat streets and Gothic houses, giving a deep and peaceful romance . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This romantic romance, I will be desperately guarded." Su Ge smiled and came to the edge of the city, going home along the Xiangguo Street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call! Snoring! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, some piercing, like the sound of the beast breathing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this voice, Su Ge’s heart trembled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sound is not heard by the ear, but the spiritual power is transmitted to the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound you hear is not a mere voice, but a hostility! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Someone wants to attack me!?" Su Ge felt a tingling scalp at this time, which was an instinctive inspiration to give him a hint of danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, Su Ge did not hesitate to run, pulled his legs and ran, while whispering and whispering: "The night is feeding the light, the glory of the moon is given to people." Fertility and knowledge, you and I are born in the night, looking up to the moon, the goddess of the great moon will wave to you, bathe in the moonlight..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the "Month of the Moon" "The scriptures, through the psionics, can have the effect of meditation and meditation, which is the effect of meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But did not run two steps, Su Geton stopped, because he found that he did not know when there was a person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This man is wearing a black robe, his face is covered and he can’t see it at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are you?" Su Ge asked tightly and nervously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
