			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suggs who have no money to take a steam locomotive can only take their legs and quickly walk from the south of the city to the center of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, the body has been strengthened by the lion's blood, or walking at this speed, I can't afford it in ten minutes." Su Ge realized this time. I feel very good at the pace of my own pace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second is very happy that the owner can go so fast, and take four big long legs, very light and follow Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scene made Su Ge think of a shot in a cat and a mouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mouse Jerry ran hard, and the Tom cat on the side of the four legs was very leisurely and easy to keep pace with his speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, the current Su Ge is the mouse Jerry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems to ride, but... shame." Su Ge thought as he walked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After crossing two blocks, Su Ge can already see the tall building in the distance next to the Church of the Holy Blood, where Bart is stationed. The place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Help me...help me..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, heard at the museum The sound of the sound again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s heart jumped, and the vision was turned on for a while, but the pedestrians around were still there, without any mysterious elements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Begging me, I am going to drown..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咕噜噜...< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment of hearing this sound, Su Ge suddenly heard a series of sounds of running water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sound seems to be the sound of a bubble rising, just like a person drowning in water, struggling in the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge frowned, just as he was about to step up and prepare to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A strange shadow is like a cloud covering the sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, Su Ge’s inspiration gave him a huge stimulation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole body was violently blasted, and the mysterious force that made him numb all over his body shrouded his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not good!" Su Ge quickly released all his psionics to protect himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the next second, he found out that he would not be able to release the psionic power because he did not use this psionic method. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呃呃呃...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just when Su Ge was wrong, the eyes of the blind suddenly burst into a burst The sound of suffocation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Su Ge felt that he fell into the sea and drowned, his mouth filled with this bitter taste, breathing very difficult, like being in his own lungs The sea is filled with the same, and the pain is severely inflated, making him completely unable to breathe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Save..." Su Ge is like a drowning man, waving his hands and struggling with peace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, it has no use. At this time, his face first changed from white to red, and from red to pale, the pupil gradually collapsed and the breathing gradually stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s all too fast and too weird. Not even giving Su Ge a chance to respond, everything has come to the brink of life and death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, is it really going to die?" Su Ge’s last thought in his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I can't die, how can I die! So colorful world is waiting for me to explore!" Su Ge's disappearing consciousness began to be intense struggle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗷呜! Hey! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the blur, he heard the call of Erha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Luobo!?" Su Ge thought a flash in his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sound has a special power, it seems to slightly dispel some shadows, but Su Ge still can not be separated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, Lobo's voice can't save me from here, I need other things! I need other sharp edges that can break this barrier!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luobo’s voice seems to break a little bit of this drowning world, and Su Ge’s vagueness can hear some outside voices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, at this time he is approaching the limit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What should I do? What should I do? I will die completely in less than ten seconds!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Suge's head is spinning fast, thinking quickly about everything that he can use now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there any mysterious knowledge I can use!?" Su Ge’s head is now running far beyond the limits of normal conditions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a low and distant bell came from the bell tower of the Church of the Holy Blood and spread to the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This voice, on behalf of ten o'clock, declares that half of the morning has passed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this kind of sound, like the morning bell and the drum, instantly knocked on the chaotic anxiety of Su Ge’s mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the electric and the flint, Su Ge thought of the phrase "The Evening Clock of the Glen". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The bell is his body, the ripples are his sharp edges, and death is his armor. The sharp edge... the rippled blade!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, Suge suddenly opened his eyes and saw countless heavy ripples through the vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These ripples, like a halo, are the ripples of the bell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ripple is his sharp blade...blade!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, Su Ge’s mind Suddenly remembered the ripples of the bell on the Frostship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That kind of ripple is the source of his voice knowledge, his foundation, and the ripples he can control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ripple is... my blade!" Su Ge instantly took out all his psionic power and wrapped the ripples of the bell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, the ripples of all the bells around it turn into transparent purple, and then these ripples are like a round blade, instantly turning this shadow Cut it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呲咔...呲咔...呲咔<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It sounds like the harsh sound of cutting porcelain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a second, with a broken sound of ice falling, Su Ge instantly felt that he had separated from the shadow and returned to the real world. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cough, cough, cough... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Severe coughing and wheezing, Su Ge opened his mouth, greedily gasping the oxygen in the air, did not mind the cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wheezing for a dozen seconds, Sug licked the eyes of Venus and looked around, at this time he leaned on a hidden corner, his neck There was a burst of burning pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking down at his whitish hands, Su Ge knows that this hand is the culprit of his own drowning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It should be a mysterious person who uses his own abilities to create a spiritual illusion for me. Through the subconscious control, the illusion of drowning is caused. In fact, there is no such thing as water. What makes me really suffocate is the hands that hold my own neck."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cough...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
