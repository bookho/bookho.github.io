			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment of holding the sword, Su Ge felt a blue wave of light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he returned to God, he found himself standing in a beautiful place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to be in the mountains, surrounded by endless high mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is standing on the edge of a lake at this time, under the naked feet is the green grass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lake in front of it flashes with sparkling light, with the sunshine of the sun, the bright spring water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are tall green trees behind and around them, and the crisp sounds of the birds are heard from them and resound in the woods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the trees, the lake is full of bright flowers, bees, butterflies dancing in it, leisurely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole world is full of vitality, giving a quiet and peaceful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is simply the fairyland in the forest where the elves live." Su Ge looked at the surrounding scenery and couldn't help but marvel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After looking around, Su Ge took his eyes back, and he found that he was standing naked here like a illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this time the feeling is completely different from the last time, because the soul of Su Ge has already received a huge sublimation and evolution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;汩汩...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of turbulent water suddenly came from the ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge heard his head and saw that there was a swell like a water column in an area of ​​this beautiful mirror-like lake. There seems to be something to emerge from underwater. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the height of the water column, under the watchful eyes of Su Ge, a beautiful figure appeared in the lake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that point, you know that it is not human. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has a long, sky-blue hair with a crown made of green branches and flowers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ink green eyes with indifference that does not belong to human beings, her appearance is as beautiful as a fairy, looks so sacred, inviolable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was wearing a blue loose robes on her upper body and the lower body and the lake surface. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a pair of water wings formed by her lake behind her, she slaps a little, her body is light, silently sliding on the lake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gliding did not produce any ripples on the lake, and the blue lake was like a mirror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Intruders, welcome to the wonderland of this lake." The red lips are slightly open, and the sound of cold and ethereal sounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge smiled a little: "I didn't expect that there are really beautiful elves like you in the world. It is my pleasure to see you."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, he is a salute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he is wearing a black suit at this time, the ceremony is full of elegance and calmness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he is naked at this time, which makes people feel very abnormal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This elf is indifferent to Su Ge’s salute, his tone is cold, and his posture is high: “The despicable invaders, since you have wanted to get involved The greed of the Holy Sword, then accept the test of this lake, this is a punishment for your despicable behavior."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can see that she has regarded Su Ge as The thief who snatched the "no regrets determination." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge did not have much explanation, nodded and asked: "Yes, then how can I accept the test of this lake?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf slightly opens the body: "The lake in this lake is a high concentration of psionic condensation. If you have enough qualifications, you can step on the water and walk to the other side. If you If you are not qualified, your body will fall into the lake and blend into the lake."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What standard does this qualification have? Beautiful fairy?" Su Ge asked respectfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf's tone is cold and blunt: "Recover your flattery, stupid human beings, I am not the kind that will be relaxed because you are flattering." "Human woman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she finished, she explained: "If you want to step on the lake, you need to have enough firm will and determination. Let you keep your initial heart at all times, not be influenced by external influences, and will not be influenced by the outside world. Only by maintaining enough will and determination to resist the erosion and catastrophe of this pure spiritual energy will not fall into the water. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, you have to be careful. This is the lake, and the mirror of the soul. It reflects the truest, darkest, most vulnerable self in your heart, they come out I will continue to seduce you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Su Ge nodded slightly: "The novels that challenge themselves in this novel are similar, and the problem is not big."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf listened and said: "Your blindness and conceit will be yours." Tomb, let's get started!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge stepped on the wet grass and came to the lake, watching the calm lake suddenly ask: “Excuse me, I can use Equipment?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a sneer in the eyes of the elf: "Of course, there is no limit. The premise is that your equipment can be carried here."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug said that he took a deep breath and stepped on the lake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, his feet did not sink, but like a step on a plush carpet, very soft and comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that the problem is not big." Taking the first step, Su Ge was a little relaxed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then stepped into the second foot, and at the moment when Su Ge’s feet all stepped on the lake, the sound of the elf suddenly approached: "Trial begins "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, Su Ge suddenly felt a tingling sensation in the soles of his feet, as if he was not stepping on the lake at the moment, but Sharp on the tip of the needle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嘶嘶嘶......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The severe pain makes Su Ge breathe a sigh of relief, whispering: "It's okay! It's okay! It's all fantasy! It's all It’s fantasy!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said, he took the second foot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this second foot is more painful than the first foot, and the severe pain almost made him yell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When the pain is called out, I will cry out. If I can’t stand it, I will return. Are you afraid of pain when you are young?" Under the lake, another Suge Condensed, and the sound is heard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge was very afraid of pain since he was a child. He was crying when he was a little painful, eager for the comfort of his parents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That was when I was young, not now!" Su Ge’s face was red and his forehead was sullen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After two baptisms of potions, his resistance to pain has indeed improved significantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the third step. The pain of this step has doubled again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The severe pain caused his legs to tremble, his spirits tremble, his scalp numb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are not prepared yet. You will get more and more painful in the future. Go back to the shore and fix it. Be mentally prepared. You will be able to do it next time." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Su Ge sounded a voice, a voice of his own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This voice is very familiar to him, because this sound has been with him for a lifetime on earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This thing will be said tomorrow, I will handle it one day tomorrow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Tomorrow! Tomorrow's formal fitness begins tomorrow, and today is the last day, tomorrow is the beginning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The homework is very simple, I will finish it all tomorrow! ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This fourth step, Suge Mai does not go out, he turned his head hard, looked at the close, just two big steps The shore that can be reached. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go back first, just prepare a little, slow down, I will be able to do it next time." Su Ge thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he wants to turn around like a demon and return to the shore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf on the side saw this eyes full of disdain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just at the moment of turning around, the black sun on the chest of Su Ge flashed a faint black light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A subsequent bell actually passed from the heart of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, Su Gewan returned to the gods like a squatting, and his eyes returned to the clear, and he looked back at the other side of the lake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My last life was a loser who would only look forward to tomorrow! There were countless regrets left in the twenty-six years. I have regretted it. For a lifetime, Heaven gave me the opportunity to live for the second time. If I was so wasted, my Su Ge is still a man!! Only for a lifetime, no regrets!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes are big, and Su Ge is almost the fourth step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;噗嗤! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, the spikes from the lake directly pierced the foot of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large amount of blood sheds and stains the blue lake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, at this time, Su Ge’s eyes are wide, and this step seems to represent a special threshold. At that moment, Su Ge felt his spirit shocked. Some spiritual special connections have been felt from this space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you continue, you may die. This is the real space. All the wounds will be brought into the real world." The elf on the side reminded me faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dead!? Hehe..." Su Ge looked down at the foot he was running through, and his mouth suddenly heard a low laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf is very dissatisfied with the smile of this despicable human being, and asks coldly: "What are you laughing at?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge slowly raised his head, and he looked upright and solemnly said: "For me, the boundary between life and death is blurred, and the death in your cognition does not make any sense to me. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Big words!" How can the elves believe these ghosts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug did not continue to say that looking at the other side of the lake, the calm step took the fifth step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the night bell is filled with constant, wandering, and resounding in his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whistle left by the ancients is as resounding in Su Ge’s mind as the words of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another bell sounds from the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, a very pronounced circular ripple spreads around the center of Su Ge's feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is impossible! How can you resonate with this lake!?" Seeing this, the elf who has been solitary is suddenly shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge slightly sideways, indifferent expression: "I am the master of death, accepting the death of the night, the death is just my robes, delusion By threatening my ignorant elves with death, you should feel honored and qualified to see my true form."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instant! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large amount of blue mist appeared in the huge night bell tattoo behind Su Ge, surrounded by Su Ge, then the top four wings of the big clock seemed to be After some induction, slowly stretched open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few seconds later, Suge’s naked body was wearing a large black robe, and the large black robe was more blue than the last time. Cloudy shading. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
