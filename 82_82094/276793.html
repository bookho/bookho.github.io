			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drinking the coffee in his hand, although his face is still a little pale, but the spirit has been significantly improved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug turned to look at the still comatose Tes. "You can wake him up, he should know something,"<br />< Bryan&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irene asked: "Are you supposed to be okay?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s soft smile: “Do not worry. "It's not a big problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh!" Elena saw this smile and nodded her head, turning her head and licking Tes's collar to raise her hand. A loud slap in the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This slap is very skilled and level, and when Su Ge worried that it didn’t work, Tes slowly opened his eyes and woke up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge glanced at Elena: "You are really skilled!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Of course, I first interrogated the prisoner... but cough, often walking outside, it is necessary to master a technique.” Elena said a little embarrassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge looked at her seriously and said: "I just gave 0 points to the technique of changing the topic. The transition is too blunt, and it sounds very embarrassing." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This words suddenly put Elena's face hot, shy, can't, just rushed to grab a sugg's mouth and said: "Don't say it! Don't say it! I will tell you later..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge feels the palm of his hand, his eyes looking at his face and Elena, whose ears are fiery, feels that this witch is unusually cute and smiles and nods to understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illina smiled with a sigh of relief, sat up and sorted out her robes, and turned to look at Tes, whose eyes were still in a confused state, asked: "Let's say, if you say that I am satisfied, I may be able to leave you a dog."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tears gradually returned to God, When I saw Su Ge and Elena sitting opposite each other, I immediately reacted and knew my current situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He glanced at Su Ge with deep awe and asked temptedly: "If I say everything I know, will this superior really bypass my life?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He does not know the identity of Su Ge, can only use his collective name to express his awe and obedience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s plain answer: “No problem, I’m talking about it, you are not qualified to let me deceive you in this kind of thing.” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the tone is dull, it sounds very reassuring and convincing in Tes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he looked at Elena and said, "You ask, I will tell the two who know what I know."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "First talk about your name, and your position and status." Elena asked first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tears honestly replied: "My name is Tes Danny. I used to be the captain of the Duke of the Mountain, and I helped him to do something unspeakable on weekdays. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For example, looting a woman he fancy and killing political opponents against him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Well..." Tes nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Continue."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After the outbreak of the civil war, due to the trade bill, Our people, who seem to have nothing to do with the Duke of the Mountains, became robbers, hijacking caravans that transported goods to the city, and disposed of all witnesses."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a brief explanation, Su Ge did not intend to listen to his past killings and asked directly: "What is the matter of the werewolf?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "The details of the werewolf are not clear. When we first contacted these things, we ordered the Duke to take some civilians for the test."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illina’s eyes glimpsed: “That is to say, the disappearance of people in the whole country is not done by Prince Jean, but by you!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Tes nodded. "Well, Prince Jean had been caught by those people at that time and continued to be used as guinea pigs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illina’s face was awkward, low The sound quality asks: "Where is the prince now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know, I have been wandering here in recent months, and the Duke is a single line. "Tes said in a hurry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows from the intelligence the horror of this witch and the temperament of his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge stretched out his hand and took some excited Elena. He turned and asked: "Now you only need to answer three questions, and the rest is different. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"First, why did the Institute of Polar Studies choose Jean?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tees Shaking his head: "I don't know too well, but I accidentally heard the Duke mention that they seem to have been in contact with the Duke for a long time, and they have already begun to act when Prince Jean is studying abroad. When Jean After the prince came back, he had completely become their jealousy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Damn bastard!" I heard this, Elena looked angry and punched. In the seat, the towering chest is frightening at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge is very calm as an outsider at this time, and continues to ask: "The second question, where is their mysterious workshop, how many people are there now?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tes cautiously said: "They have a lot of mysterious workshops today. I only know two, one is in the underground of the Duke's courtyard, the other is in Yucheng’s city government.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“As for the number of people, there were only three or four at the beginning. When I left, there were already more than 20 people, but they Many people are no different from ordinary people. Every day when the gods say that the stars are correct, there is something like the ancient city of Lalaiye in the dream. It is upset." Referring to this, Tes There is obvious irritability and disgust between the eyebrows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Su Ge’s heart sighed: “When the stars are correct, there is an inextricable connection with that one.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
