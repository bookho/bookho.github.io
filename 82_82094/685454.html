			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of such a powerful Yi, Su Ge took a deep breath, and when he spit out, the whole body began to emit a strong black atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A burst of innocent shadow rises behind Su Ge and looks like a god with four huge wings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black scent that symbolizes death surrounds Su Ge's body. In a flash, Su Ge becomes a mysterious existence that walks with death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, the glove of Su Ge’s right hand flashed a glimmer of light, his lips moving slightly, and he was chanting an unpleasant spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The indescribable front of the person seems to feel the danger, its body suddenly jumped from the top of the roof, opened its tentacles, the whole body is like a huge net Spurped toward Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a muffled sound, the body of the unnamed dominator is like a big net on the body of Su Ge, and the body is constantly squirming and wants to put Su Ge Devouring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, its attack was blocked by the late bell at this time, and Su Ge was like a villain sitting in a glass ball, not a nominee, that is about to The glass ball bites the monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge's singular calm, his lips squirming, and his fast speed continue to swear by the swearing spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two seconds later, the defense of the night bell is about to collapse under the enormous power of the unnamed dominator. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Su Ge suddenly opened his eyes, it was a pair of eyes burning with ghosts and ghosts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless black death scent in front of him, and the black gloves are like a strange door, emitting a transparent glow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Feel the sorrow of the undead - the stalk of the darkness!" with the name of the spell. The black death fog is constantly expanding and distorting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a violent soul that can see countless creeps and sly inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The death fog and the violent soul are combined by a mysterious force that ordinary people can't understand, forming a group of twisted faces that are constantly screaming with madness, with countless souls, clenching their arms and flashing strange fires. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This black fog has strong penetration and ductility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the moment of appearance, he directly entered the body of the unnamed governor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an instant infiltration from its whole body tissue, forming a more horrible fog that completely envelopes it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pump! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unnamed dominator shrouded in this dark fog fell to the ground and the body began to draw and twist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be seen that one third of its body has been swallowed by black fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless faces, the fog of the arm is like a monster with countless heads, and the body is swallowed by the frantic shackles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get rid of the attack of the unnamed dominator, Su Ge Chang Shu quickly stepped back two steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the thousand-faced monster has completely swallowed up the unnamed dominator. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fog began to squirm, seemingly chewing, and seems to be digesting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the dark fog, Su Ge took out a book: "Knowledge is not divided into righteousness."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The darkness of the dead is entangled in this year and a half of the game, Su Ge in the death sect's secret book "The Book of the Dead" recorded mysterious spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This spell belongs to the relatively advanced ban in the book of the Undead, and no one in the dead sect that was dying at the time could use this spell. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conditions required for this spell are not only ample death and enough dead soul, but also absolute control over both. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point is to release this spell with enough spirit and firm will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existence of a black group of things itself requires fifty-two points to see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because this spell is a frenzied nature of the enemy and the enemy, the probability of reintroduction and accidental injury is very high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when you release it, you must have enough mental control to control it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, you need to have enough awareness to support the burden that this extraordinary spell understands the caster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After about three minutes, the strange black and white mist gradually dissipated, and the unnamed governor who was swallowed by it was also spit out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, the unnamed dominator seems to suffer from indescribable dissolution and destruction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the humanoid body has been dissolved halfway, it becomes a pool of water and slowly flows on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining half is full of cysts and ulcers, constantly flowing out of concentrated water and losing all activity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pungent taste is drawn from the body of the unnamed dominator, making people feel nausea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge turned his head and retched twice, and the unnamed dominator completely lost his activity and died after struggling twice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two vomits, Su Ge did not stop here, but walked along the previous corridor towards the second floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving the pungent smell, Su Geping regained his mood and continued to mention 120% of the spirit to move on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Su Ge stepped on the corridor, he returned to the real world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clean and clean corridors, with an environment without any sound, the strange and oppressive atmosphere makes people feel mad<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The door at the end of the stairs is also half open at this time. It seems that Myra forgot to close the door when she walked back and forth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The release of the night bell, the inspiration of the self has been driven to the maximum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once again, if there is no danger, Su Ge walks silently to the second floor and walks in through the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a completely different tidy outside, the current clinic is very messy, medical equipment and chairs are lying there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the table, there are a lot of scattered cases and books on the ground, as if they were ransacked by thieves, all things have been turned over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Released the late bell, Su Ge did not find an abnormality after a simple exploration around, so he continued along the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is now eager to know if Myra is still here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle is a curved arcade with four winding roads leading to the left and right sides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge struggled, and patiently took the four roads aside. After the first three did not find any problems, Su Ge was in the fourth At the end of a road, an abnormality was found in a study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire study is incredibly messy, all bookshelves and books are scattered on the ground, or stacked together, or scattered stacks, it does not look like a study. It is an incinerator that burns books. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s eyes looked around: “Under normal circumstances, even if you look for any books, you won’t get all the bookcases around you to pile up in the middle. It seems that someone has intentionally thrown it from the shelf, and the purpose seems to be covering up something important."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Su Ge came to the study, patiently Completely sort out these books. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patience and caution have always been the two great qualities of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time passed slowly, and about an hour later, Su Ge found a book under a few seemingly ordinary books. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
