			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next two people did not talk about something heavy, but simply reminiscent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge said the process of the establishment of the church in the late night, and the experience of the last year and a half, of course, did not say the members of the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emeria is very interested in Su Ge’s travels this year and a half, especially the free-spirited adventures and the deserts and wastelands that are far away from the dust. Emilia is very yearning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I can, I want to go see the desert and see the grassland." Emilia had a longing in her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge calmly said: "You can always."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I still...no Yes." Emilia lowered her head and looked at the nib of the pen, her eyes were a bit fascinating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is not sure about her reasons, but he does not intend to continue this heavy topic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When are you going to come out?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emeria picked up the pen and said, "I am not in a hurry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How can I save you from going out?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Emilia shook her head: "Can I go out, you can't help me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "This is not the same as our agreement."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I left, Emilia made it clear, and hoped that Su Ge would save her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emilia said calmly: "This manor is called the Vows Manor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Manor?” Su Ge said he had not heard of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emilia asks: "What can you feel in this manor?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"Nothing can be felt," Su Ge said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you feel too ordinary?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Su Ge feels a little bit Too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone who enters the vows of the estate must make a vow, and if you want to leave, you either complete the vow, or become more than The power of the vowed person is hard to rush out." Emilia calmly explained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s heart: “What vows have you made?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emeria Calm answer: "Completely decipher all the contents of "Three Nights Before Creation"."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...How much have you done?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"0%."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the level of the person who pledges?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"大贤者."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"............"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Su Ge is completely speechless, I don’t know what to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three nights before the creation of the world, the original code has a large number of ancient gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is God? As expressed, it is the language of the gods and the language used by the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All mysterious people are deeply aware of the four principles of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not realistic to have a person decipher a book full of gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg asked: "So, are you going to sit here for a lifetime?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amy Leah smiled and said: "It's also very good here. It's not a fight with the world. It's quiet and peaceful. It raises flowers every day, feeds the birds, and soaks the sun. This is how many people dream of life."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge corrected: "However, these things need to be based on freedom."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have no freedom since I was a child, and I have no choice. Freedom has always been for me. It’s something that can’t be touched, and I’ve never expected it.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Su Ge suddenly felt a little distressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows some of her life and experience from Shelly’s mouth, and at this time she is in the eyes of Su Ge, who is locked in a cage. Young white dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I can, I will let Govins take a look, he should be able to take you away." Su Ge said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, what surprised Su Ge was that Emilia actually shook her head and refused to say: "I really hoped that you would take me away at the beginning, but with As time went by, I found that something was doomed to escape."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, she smiled warmly: "Fate, this kind of thing, people can't please "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this smile, Sug can't help but stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are a kind person." Emilia saw this scene seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s message said: “I have many ways to escape from my fate, and even let you directly see the true God and get the protection of the gods. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emilia still smiles: "The Lord of the Storm and Death, the only true God of the Valley and the Abyss. This great existence can of course protect me." A poor body. But there are things that don’t give you peace of mind. It’s all in vain to get more sanctuary shelter.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Su Ge is understood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not her own who is actually keeping her here, she is herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What purpose do you have?" Sug turned his head and stared at her like a eagle eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emilia said calmly: "Repay the debt, then detached."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing these two words, Su Ge breathed suddenly suffocated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You want to be a saint?" Su Ge whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Emilia laughs and says nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug did not ask, and did not say much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will stay here for twelve days, I will try to see you every day." Su Ge said, turned and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emeria did not refuse, and stopped Suge in silence: "I know you have eyeliner in the center, but I still ask better." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug turned to look at her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you know the Expedition of the Holy Swords?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Expedition of the Holy Swords? "Sug a glimpse." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emilia stood up and stretched out and explained: "After knowing these words, one of the three saints, the Blood Moon Saints personally led the team. Expedition."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where is the expedition?" Su Ge's face was full of shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bloody saints can be said to be the strongest existence in the whole mysterious world today. It is certain that the saints are at least the dominator level, even Daxian The mystery of the level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emeria answered two words: "Abyss."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where is this side? Is the message related to the abyss?" Su Ge touched his chin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Emilia shook her head: "I can't figure it out, I hope it will be useful to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Suge sighed and said: "It's a pity that you don't want to come out, I am preparing a big show for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
