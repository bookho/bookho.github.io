			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ps: For the lord: 霄 霄 霄 霄 加 加 加. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reporting here, it has been more than two hours, coming to an end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emilia turned to look at the five bishops on her left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five bishops nodded at the same time, indicating that Su Ge had no problems and that all problems were perfectly connected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then she turned to look at the five people at Rogan and confirmed if there was any discrepancy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five people also nodded at the same time, indicating no problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sug, please don't worry, we have sent people to follow up, hoping to help you find your sister's whereabouts." Emilia speaks and appease. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge listened to his gratitude and bowed slightly: "Thank you for your kindness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Milia nodded slightly and took a deep breath. She sat up with her hands on the table and said, "Sug Sotos, your heroic, your caution, your forbearance got all the church staff." Respect, and the approval of the goddess. Because of your heroic performance in this incident, through direct and indirect participation, the conspiracy of the original bishop of the church was destroyed, and the loss and casualties of the goddess were minimized."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your faith in the goddess, you are recognized by everyone for the spirit of self-sacrifice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now I announced that Suger Sotos was promoted to the rank of the bishop, and the deputy bishop position."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Su Ge’s heart jumped. The extent of this promotion is somewhat large. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The system of clergy is not too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lowest level is the monk or nun, above which is the priest, which is the level before Su Ge. The priest can manage an independent church and all believers who baptize and pray in this church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest is above the priest, and the level of the former Gaelic priest is the priest. They are generally assistants to the bishops and help the bishops manage several churches in a certain area of ​​the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest is above the bishop, completely independent of all the religious issues of a city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But because of the large span between the two, there is also an associate bishop in the middle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deputy bishop is higher than the priest, but does not have any real power. This kind of position can be said to be a completely vain job, a qualification title. Their role is to temporarily replace the bishop to manage the city when the bishop is absent. After the bishop returns, he can only deal with some miscellaneous chores. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, the former Bishop Lauren, the daily work is to assign mysterious tasks and help the clergy to baptize. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this position can be said to be just right, because this time, after careful calculation, I know that Su Ge’s credit is immeasurable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not that he found the problem, if it’s not that he found Luke (the church perspective), indirectly summoning the powerful existence and letting the monsters go rampant, The problem at that time was not just this city, but it might spread to the great catastrophe of the whole empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of credit is not a problem for the bishop, but Su Ge’s qualifications are too low, and even if he is promoted, it’s impossible to join a church. The young people of the half year are promoted to the bishop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge has no opinion on this promotion, but is very happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He likes this kind of loyalty that sounds loud but has no work, has face, money, and does not have to work. There are not many such positions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s knees on the ground, his hands crossed his chest and whispered: “Thanks to the goddess’ gift, thanks to the Archbishop’s trust and promotion, I will not let it down. The goddess and the archbishop are expecting me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Very well, you should go to the first floor and wait for something to talk to after we have talked." Emilia said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge nodded reverently and turned to go on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Su Ge left, several more people came in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people are Father Anthony, Mother Marlene, Father Harden, Ivan and others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, these people are not questioned, but are evaluated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This time we have two goals, the first goal is to rebuild the entire city of Bain and completely block the news." Emilia Said in a serious manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people listened and understood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, she continued: "The second thing, we need to use this city as a springboard to calm the civil strife in the Principality of Guinness and incorporate it into our church. Asylum."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As the Guinness Kingdom next to our northeastern border, we have a very important geographical position. Once there is civil strife, our testing will be subject to Huge interference, and among the chaotic refugees, there will be a large number of cults coming in. In recent months, the cults in the northeastern province have increased by 50% compared with last year. This is not a good sign, so we have to Master the Guinness Kingdom!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, Emilia’s ethereal voice has a hint of metal, and it’s unquestionable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd immediately nodded and understood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emilia continued: "We were going to choose a person to be a pioneer here, and to take the lead in the Guinness Principality to investigate the situation and to settle in for us." Pave the way. But from now on, the most suitable candidate has already appeared."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogen said: "Sug’s care and caution just now When entering the church, he was praised by both Jellos and Ron, and according to Anthony and Ivan, he has a very strong will and spirit, and is very good at accepting new things and deep learning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivan immediately said: "Returning to the Archbishop, Su Ge Sotos's learning ability is indeed very strong, I have taught him a month of runes and circles, A lot of knowledge he can quickly digest, it only takes a night to get through."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
