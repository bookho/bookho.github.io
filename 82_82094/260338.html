			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a detailed inquiry about Pete, Su Ge turned his head and asked him about a mysterious two-knife veteran. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the enthusiasm and pressure of Su Gewei, the old man hurriedly answered the question just after. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to both is almost the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sugg, who was very satisfied with the answer, smiled and destroyed the spirit of the old man, then cut off his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After awakening Pete, he entered a very bloody venting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After forty minutes, the uninformed Pete died in powerless mourning, ending his life of perverted sin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug wiped the blood on his forehead and turned to look at the disgusting cave: "The breath of the god of death, this thing can't be placed here, later Maybe there will be problems. But I can't handle it with my current ability..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A moment of contemplation, Su Ge took out a hand-like hair The velvet textile infused the psionic energy into it, and saw a soft moonlight flashing over it, turning into a pair of cute short-horned, furry little lambs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge whispered what had just happened to the lamb, and the situation here was truthfully said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the hand shook, and the little lamb turned into a silvery moonlight disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; turned and picked up Bieber’s body, and Su Ge silently went down the mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the way down the mountain, Sug saw two still sleeping soldiers, turned to look at the Bieber on the shoulder, Su Ge still killed this Two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the mountain went halfway, a moonlight flashed, and the cute, chubby little white sheep appeared in front of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening the mouth, there is the voice of Emilia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sug, you are doing very well! Very very good! This is very important information and information. You are temporarily resting there for the night. I have ordered Bishop Kirian to lead the Holy Swords to go there overnight, about You can reach your location at nine o'clock tomorrow morning, then you and them will determine the situation, then you can go to the capital safely."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge listened to his heart and said: "This speed is catching up with the modernization of the earth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Responding to the news, Su Ge squatted Bieber’s body returned to the foot of the mountain. When passing a small stream, Su Ge thought about it and kept his body clear, especially the heavy makeup on his face. He didn’t want the poor father to see himself. The son has been so humiliated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Late at night, Cody’s home faintly uttered a cry of grief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crying person has tried to suppress his own crying, otherwise the neighbors hear it, but...the pain and grief of the heartbreaking can’t be suppressed. of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge was sitting alone on the wooden block outside, watching the dullness of the moon in the sky, some of the gasping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This world is not too unreasonable." Su Ge was very upset. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, when he recalls his own affairs on the earth, he breathed a sigh of relief: "As long as someone exists, there is no fairness in this world." It can be said."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After, stand up and go back to the hotel to rest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cemetery in the dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge met with Hills outside the temple in his own human form. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilsh was a little excited because it was the first time she saw the Lord's apostle in her dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where are you now?" Su Ge first asked about progress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hills said with a smile: "It has already come out of the night, and it is expected that the day after tomorrow will almost enter the territory of Guinness, and the day after tomorrow will arrive at the capital."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge nodded with satisfaction: "I have been working hard recently, and I am running around."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, not hard. The opportunity to spread the glory of the Lord is my life. The greatest honour and joy." Hills looked happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is Vigania still with you?" Su Ge suddenly thought of the second female knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hills nodded: "Well, I still like her very much, straightforward, the officer is clean, although the name has some problems, but the strength is OK." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's how you get along!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can make Hills make a sincere friend, Not to mention the second-class knight, it doesn't matter if you are Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, Su Ge just woke up and heard a sorrowful sound from outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge did not need to know and knew that Cody’s son was buried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heavy mourning bell makes people feel heavy and makes this funeral a sacred taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The bell of the funeral?" In this ordinary bell, Su Ge felt an unusual state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since simply eating breakfast, Su Ge did not go to the funeral, but hurried to the mountains, ready to go with the main church of Kirian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, the untimely bomb in the mountains is much more important than the funeral. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At nine o'clock in the morning, when Su Ge came to the place yesterday, he found that it was not discovered by other soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a few people are already standing in the cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people are dressed in neat white light armor, carrying a silver sword that is similar to theirs, wearing only a pair of eyes, with wings on both sides. Streamlined helmet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are coming on time!" said a middle-aged man in the same sacred sword team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishop of one of the five bishops, a master swordsman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge swears: "May Goddess bless you, the brave bishop."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ryan retaliated and took a shot of Su Ge's shoulder: "This thing is handled very well. I just looked at it briefly. There are a lot of weird things here, so it is very likely that there will be uncontrollable horror in the process of letting go." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you need to destroy this array?" Su Ge's inquiry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kilian nodded and said: "Of course, the team members are collecting the necessary situations inside, and after the collection is completed, they can be completely destroyed."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg nodded and stepped forward to go to the cave to see it, but was stopped by Kirian: "It’s good to give it to us, when are you going to the capital?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge stopped and said: "The Archbishop let me and you determine the situation and you can leave."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Well, now the situation has been confirmed, you still have to go to the capital! The situation there is very complicated, the sooner you can get to know the situation there." Kirian looked at the advice of the old city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded, glanced at the cave and smiled and said: "There is nothing I need, I will leave!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "All the way through, the glory of the goddess will illuminate the road ahead of you." Kelian's sincere blessing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the way down the mountain, Sug recalled the blockade of Kirian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sure enough, the situation in Guinness is completely different from the situation on the surface. There are absolutely hidden secrets here."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, Su Ge also thought of Jerome's advice to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
