			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Suge was going to ask Tes, Elena walked over and said, "This is a business road, too eye-catching, I suggest you clean up the battlefield." Then he took him quickly and left."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge silently nodded and turned to look at the dead people, intended to carry out the souls of these people. Pray, but from the current situation, time and your own psionic power are not allowed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's you!" At this time, Tes seemed to know Elena, and she was shocked when she saw her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, what he seems to think of, hurriedly shouted: "Don't kill me! Don't kill me! I know important information, important information about werewolves." !"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people listened to their hearts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that he not only knows you, but also knows your purpose." Su Ge said, lifting his cane, and ruthlessly pumping it around his neck. Stun him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ilina’s strength is not small, she reached out and grabbed the collar of Tes, turned and dragged him and said, “This guy’s status is not low, know There are many people in my portrait, but those who know my true intentions are generally the people of the Institute of Polar Research and the middle of the Duke of the Mountain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge I didn’t speak forehead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before taking the potion sequelae again, each time there is a lack of tingling in the forehead when there is lack of psionics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to the four drivers, enter the car to rest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coaches connected the seven carriages, and almost one drove the two carriages to move on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the driver was working, Jelena took care of the body over there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only seeing her very skilled search for valuable things on the body, mainly including cash and valuable items on these people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The driver did not care about this because they knew it was not the money they could get. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For them, they will spend a lot of time in this disaster, and their income will be much richer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, the previous work was seven people, and the rest of the guards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only four of them left, and the money for the guards is not paid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, the fear of four people is covered by interests, and the heart is full of enthusiasm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After fifteen minutes, everything was packed and the carriage continued to move forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge three people are sitting in the carriage of a carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge leaned in the corner and paled, holding his forehead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong with you?" Irina asked with a look at Sugg. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a far cry from the attitude of just killing and decisive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug is somewhat powerless to say: "The depletion of the spirit can cause headaches."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" What does depletion have to do with headaches?” Elena asked after a lot of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg’s thoughts were a little chaotic at this time, so he was too lazy to lie and said freely: “This is the sequela of taking the potion.”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;! ! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The casual words made Elena’s heart jump: “Have you taken the potion?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Well..." Su Ge nodded weakly and seemed too lazy to speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illina looked at the weak Su Ge at this time, and the young curiosity that had such a weak performance at the same time for the powerful elegance and ferocity swelled to the extreme . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What kind of person are you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking in my heart, Elena made a slight touch and reached out and touched Sug's white face. She nodded and said, "Well, it seems that it is just a headache without a fever. Do you have any medication for relief?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sog seems to think of something, slightly raised his head and pointed to the backpack on the side and said: "There is a bottle of coffee bought out of the city, you can open it for me, thank you."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illina turned and opened the backpack to find out the size of the fist, aluminum bottled coffee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking down at the above description: "Concentration 99%!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are sure Can this drink drink?" Elena asked with amazement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This concentration of coffee is the most original, specially processed concentrate without any other ingredients. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No sugar, no milk, no tea, no added ingredients. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This thing can relieve pain, help me open it!" Su Ge sat up and said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;噗嗤! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illina cut the aluminum cover with a knife. Suddenly, a bitter bitterness, with a touch of mellow taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illina frowned, hurriedly don’t overdo it: "I smell the smell, I know how hard it is."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug took a bottle and took a sip: "Give me ten minutes..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then close your eyes and you are not talking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irene sitting on the side quietly looked at Su Ge’s white face and gradually found that Su Ge had a special kind of cuteness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Last night, I had a calm face, just high above, elegant and cruel, now it is such a weak and cute temperament like a boy injured next door, it is really contradictory. "Pole."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a mutter in her heart, and she looked at it for a moment, then smiled a little: "But it gives a feeling of incomparable truth and love."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A person who is too perfect will only give people an illusory unreality. This is just the inner feeling of Elena for Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can see Su Ge now, she found that Su Ge is a real person, a person who can make friends and become friends. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a time, she felt that she knew a lot about Su Ge and her relationship was a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge was very punctual, and opened his eyes ten minutes later. At this time, the look was obviously restored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking up just to see Elena holding a black bag, counting the golden Langke, a look of happiness and happiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this the money of the dead?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illina nodded slightly and looked up at him and asked, "How? Look down on my behavior?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp Su Ge shook his head: "I can't talk about it, but I have some obstacles in my heart. I have been educated to be a dead person since childhood, and I don't want to possess the dead as much as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"First of all, congratulations on having a good parent with normal values."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Second!" The respect of Elena’s face gradually became ridiculous: Now, please give up your true thoughts and thoughts. When you really want to starve to death, I believe that you don’t say the dead, the dead body will not be left behind."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge did not deny, but nodded and agreed: "You are right."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine if it really arrives In that step, he will make the same choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illina accidentally took the money, she thought that Su Ge would argue with herself, she even prepared several counterattacks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Su Ge did not say much, and took a sip of the high-density scary coffee, taste it and enjoy it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
