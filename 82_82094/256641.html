			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After turning over this hill, Su Ge looked down and saw some light in the blur. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hill is not downhill, but a relatively gentle mountainside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vegetation in front of the mountainside is relatively lush, but there seems to be some traces of vandalism in the middle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light is transmitted through these densely growing forests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It should be there." I thought, Su Ge was more cautious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The closer you are, there may be more traps and alerts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Su Ge once again rings the bell and determines the situation around him by the ripples of the sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are some physical traps and warnings, and there are no mysterious techniques and tactics. Are you forgotten?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open your eyes, although some doubts, but still accelerate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be careful to bypass the traps that caused the alarm. Su Ge spent fifteen minutes walking through the woods and seeing a relatively steep cliff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And under the cliff, he saw the cave that Cody mentioned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cave is not large, it is naturally formed in general, but it can also see some traces of human beings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two teams of soldiers outside the cave to patrol, a team of three people, equipped with firearms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Does this guy really want to break the rules?" Su Ge frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mysterious world has many regulations, the most important of which is that the mysterious person cannot interfere with the regime and cannot help the army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mystery is mysterious because they are far from the public and are not well known to ordinary people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the world knows, then mystery is not mysterious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mom, when can we change back? I am really fed up here!" At this moment, a team of patrols whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another voice came: "Keep it, we can go down tomorrow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "The group of madmen, every day dealing with a stinky body is a mystery? Still can't move someone crazy, we need to help them wipe their buttocks, this is a fart mystery! Every day is still against us, I can't wait for it." A shot broke him!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't be impulsive, the Duke seems to have some of them enough, let's just be patient, wait until they really research it out." The soldiers of our soldiers are not dead, and we will deal with them at that time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hiding in the eyes of Su Ge flashed a glimmer of light: "The Duke...should be managing the area The lord, the undead drug is an opportunity for them to cooperate with each other. But it is really naive. Undead soldiers? Everything has a price to exchange, it is estimated that then you will become a group like zombies."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Listen to their right In combination with the surrounding conditions, it can be determined that the guys inside are not so powerful, and may even have no expert-level mystery."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was such a huge project here, and even a temporary mysterious workshop was built, but there was no means of any mysterious warning. From this point of analysis, Su Ge got two conclusions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is because the people inside are very strong and have a lot of confidence, so they don’t bother to set a psionic trap to alert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is that the mystery inside is a rookie, and will not be equipped with a psionic trap and an alarming nature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And from the conversation between the two soldiers, Su Ge knows that the people inside are not strong, they may go out of control and go crazy at any time for some reason, even companions After they went crazy, they could not handle it. Instead, they wanted the soldiers to help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And from the disdainful tone of the soldiers, the mysterious person who was disposed of by them seemed to be no different from ordinary people, and several shots were killed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It really humiliates our mystery!" Su Ge looked disdainful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the gradual departure of the soldiers, Su Ge indulged: "Since it is determined that there is no master here, then there is no need to be cautious, and all these guys are disposed of. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Su Ge eyes are cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The two just have some scruples, thinking that you are only ordered to act as ordinary soldiers, since you came to this step..." I thought, the cane in hand Gradually turned into a sharp long sword, bowed to the waist and quietly approached. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Sug is not going to use a mysterious solution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is determined that the mystery inside is not strong, but he is not a strong person himself, I don’t know how many people are inside, since I decided to deal with it all, then You can't waste too much combat resources on these ordinary people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey! I remember you seem to have caught a woman who fled from the capital city? How?" asked the short soldier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three people in front of you still don't know that someone is close and continue to speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shuangfei, I heard that it is still a nobleman, fine skin and tender meat, white skin, not a woman in the capital." A slightly obese soldier A smug look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Grandma's, your kid's luck is really good, how can I not touch this kind of good thing..." The last taller soldier looked envious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not a good luck, this is awesome! You didn't see it at the time, I..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait, something is wrong!" When the obese soldiers were still bragging, the short soldier suddenly interrupted nervously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time obese soldiers also felt that something was wrong, because two people found that the tall soldiers were gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jack! Where are you?" the obese soldier whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no one replied to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere is extremely dignified, two people take out the pistol in an instant, and they are guarded, while the short soldiers take out the signal gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a black shadow flashed in front of the two, and then the obese soldier saw only one person’s hand pinching the short soldier Neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, the short soldier couldn’t even make a scream, and the body was soft and fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;March gradually rises, soft moonlight shines through the treetops on the body of a short soldier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can see the short soldier’s neck being smashed, and a lot of blood is squirting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The obese soldier’s eyes slammed and raised the pistol regardless of the three seven twenty-one. It’s okay to hit people, and the gunshots should also attract the attention of the companions. force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While raising the gun, the obese soldier grows his mouth and looks out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound was all in the eyes of the blind, but he was grabbed by his powerful hand and blocked his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of this hand is extraordinary, he can't even break free. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who is this! So there will be such a great effort!" Obese soldiers were shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the struggle of his eyes wide open, a long sword flashed with a bitter cold light in the moonlight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The obese soldiers felt that the arm seemed to be electrified, and then a sharp pain came from the arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This set of actions is done in one go, but only two seconds before and after, fast and deadly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dark night, a face with a black mask and only a pair of ice blue eyes appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
