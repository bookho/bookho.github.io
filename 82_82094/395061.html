			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Introduce yourself first, let the Associate Pope know you." Sitting down, Su Ge said to the four people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four people nodded respectfully, and the first to talk was a middle-aged woman with a short blond hair and a bodybuilding body: "My name is Kara, 37 years old. Once a visitor to the Holy Blood Church, the expert-level hypnotist, now Lingshi 57, went crazy about hitting ¥%#¥ about five years ago."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; The mysterious existence, not only Su Ge and others can not hear, can not tell the 57-point vision of Carana. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas smiled slightly: "Hello, Miss Carla."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second person is A middle-aged man who is a little thin and energetic, he seems to be in his early forties, and his ordinary face has a pair of very beautiful green eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My name is Nishi, 41 years old. I used to be the purple moon substitute of the Church of the Holy Blood. I am a semi-master alchemist. Now I am 64, about seven. I was crazy because I touched %#@ years ago."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although everyone did not hear anything, they instinctively knew that the existence of the two could not be A thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The semi-master alchemist!?" Hearing this, the mirs sitting opposite was interested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Czech has a pleated, thin face with a smile: "This hunter master seems to be very interested?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mill smiled slightly: "very interested."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge whispered: "It seems that the two have a lot of opportunities for cooperation in the future. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two did not say much, the introduction continued. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third is a man who is one meter tall and has a well-proportioned body and looks better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man has a pair of weird gray eyes that make people look like blind people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a ponytail and has no expression on his face, giving him an introverted, embarrassing feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My name is Alger, I am 35 years old. I used to be the bloody moonwalker of the Church of the Holy Blood. I am an expert doctor. Now I am 55, I am About four years ago, I witnessed the birth of a false god and went crazy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The word "pseudo god!?" immediately attracted the attention of Su Ge et al. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger looked up with respectfulness, and some godless eyes looked at Su Ge: "The Pope, I heard that this time I have come to the Son of God, I hope to conduct some investigations."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is no problem, after the false gods, continue."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last one has a black-haired hair, a golden pupil, and a small round face female. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looks the youngest of the four and looks like she is only in her early thirties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sorts out her posture and says seriously: "My name is Nicole. I am 34 years old. I used to be a nurse in the medical district of the Church of the Holy Blood. I was originally ordinary." People, who received the experiment about six years ago, entered too many blood medicines, heard a lot of weird sounds, and went crazy. I now look at 40 points."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Sug! This Nicole, I want it!" Mil immediately stood up and said excitedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas hurriedly said: "Grandpa, Nicole is not a test article!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mil smiled: "Reassured, I am not crazy, I will not abuse my own people. I think she should be my right hand, so that Marvel can be liberated."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nicole immediately agreed to listen, originally she was in the ten people, there is no substantial combat power, usually on the week to help others cook, play, and now there is a place She is naturally very happy to reflect her own value. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then Vanas and others followed the introduction of a circle, by the way introduced the current situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Kara’s listening, he said: “I generally know what the Pope meant. Gerald (the other six people) still have some things to deal with. It’s estimated that they will come in about half a year. But you can rest assured that there are four of us. At the same time, you can also help the whole church to be perfect."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge listened with a satisfied face: "That's good, let's go, I will take you out first. Take a walk and get acquainted with the environment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After three people walked out of the palace to the Cathedral of the Holy Blood that had just been built and had not moved in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cathedral of the Holy Blood is now very grand and magnificent, standing outside the dark iron gate, three people sighed slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I thought that there was no chance in this life to go straight in." Alchemist Xize slightly sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bloody traveler, Alger, said casually: "I don't feel anything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Su Ge walked in with the three men, walked through the square in front of the square, paved with white stone slabs, and walked into the Church of the Holy Blood from the main entrance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The church has been renovated and magnificent, with beautiful murals on the walls and the contents of the March goddess sheltering people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge came naturally not to visit, walked straight down the stairs, and the four did not stay too much to take the lead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he walked to the top bell tower of the cathedral, Nishizawa, an alchemist, suddenly asked: "The Pope, I remember that you have some of my owners." The gift, the power of the night, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well." Su Ge nodded and looked at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xizeg’s big bell toward the clock tower said: “The Pope’s majesty, the entire Basilica of the Holy Blood is a huge circle of law, with dense spiritual circuits everywhere. I can connect these psionic circuits to a receiver through runes and arrays. With this receiver, the bell can vibrate according to your psionic input, so you can use your own bells. It is directly spread through the big bell to the whole city. The residents in the city are all werewolves. Even if the human form is restored, it will not be very stable. If your night clock can appease their spirit and suppress their animal nature, then in the future, They will all be devout believers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge heard this eye brighten: "Can you still reach this point?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xizeg reached out and touched the big clock: "Of course. After all, this The vast Basilica of the Holy Blood is a huge psionic receiver and launch tower. It is designed to wake up the vibration of this big clock whenever you are in any part of the city."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dry beautiful, Nishizawa!" Su Ge gave his approval and affirmation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you for your approval, His Majesty the Pope." Nishizawa was a little happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there are not many contacts with this young pope, they are deeply aware of the horror and unfathomableness of the pope, especially with them. The gods communicate directly with this, making them unimaginable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When walking down the clock tower and coming to the logistics department converted into the Dukes of the Mountain Range, Cara made a suggestion: "The entire medical district must be established as soon as possible, here is The core area and symbol of a Basilica of the Holy Blood. The Basilica of the Holy Blood is the guarantee of life and the source of healing. This will give the citizens more peace of mind. At the same time, in the future, the church’s clergy will be killed and killed. Priority is given to the establishment of the medical system, the necessary facilities, and the laboratories to be equipped, the blood bank for storing blood, etc."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg listened and immediately thought of himself When I first took the potion experience, I agreed to nod and said: "Kara said that the medical district is indeed a very critical core place and must be resolved first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp After wandering around the medical area, four people followed the side back to the Cathedral of the Holy Blood. Alger, who had been silent, said: "The Pope, I want to confirm that everyone in the city has become a werewolf. What?”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded: "Well, it has become, there is no spare."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The werewolf itself is mysterious One of the systems, since everyone has become a mysterious phenomenon, then in this city, mystery is not mysterious. In this case, can we cultivate the mysterious common sense and related fighting consciousness of the inhabitants here? After cultivating these, we don’t even need a lot of comrades in the battle sequence. There are wolves around here that can kill intruders. Everyone can handle some routine situations and help us monitor outsiders. After all, the wolf's sense of smell is very sensitive, and it is very united when it is inhabited."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sell it well! Although I have planned this for a long time, but there is no such clear thinking and logic, Alje your idea is very useful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger listens It’s rare to show a little happiness on his face: “Thank you for the Pope’s compliment.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s mouth tilted slightly and looked at the three with a thumbs up: “Looking Come out, the three are really elites with real knowledge before. I am very happy to get help from all three of you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you contribute to my lord? Our meager wisdom is an honour for me and my people." The three men stood naked and said in unison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge chuckled and looked forward and said, "Since the direction is fixed, then the next question is the manpower."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three people nodded, Cara said: "It is best to be a trustworthy person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear this, Su The eyes looked at the front with a gaze: "How about the people who failed to join the church last time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three eyes lit up after listening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Very suitable!" The three men said in unison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, Alger said: "The Pope, if you intend to develop core personnel on a large scale, we need to establish a system that belongs to our own church. Without a clear system structure, people can easily become confused when they are one more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other two nodded: "Yes, Your Majesty."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge has a well-thought-out saying: "I am very happy to hear your suggestions, but rest assured, I am already ready for this."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can make Emilia a little over the surface, including Ivan, Father Anthony. And in the dark, you can go back to secretly through Vegniya and others, let those People come here for other purposes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, the tone will not be white, and it is bound to be interspersed with some Emilia, you have Ability to dispose of them or turn them into our own people?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
