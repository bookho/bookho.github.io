			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When ready, Su Ge began to look for the soul of Macock’s existence through the power of his priest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But soon, Su Ge found himself unable to find the soul of Mark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's going on here!?" Su Ge's face is weird. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the mystery of suicide, his soul should not be completely dissipated so quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong?" asked Father Hank as he saw Sugg. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Scotland opened his eyes and said: <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp "I can not perceive the horse Hancock soul." After hearing this, Harden immediately shook his head and said: "Impossible, the soul will not dissipate so quickly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hanker Fringe locks: "I can It is guaranteed that no one other than us has ever been exposed to the body before, and all of our medical staff have no knowledge of mystery."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a stalemate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Silence for a dozen seconds, Gael said faintly: "The young people are still too young, can't you see such obvious things?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge waits and asks: "What does Father Gail mean?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cover There was a proud explanation on his face: "A little check will reveal that the remaining psionic power in Macock’s body has completely disappeared, but there is no residual emotion left. This is not a normal phenomenon, suicide Even if people don't have grievances, they should have strong regrets and attachments. Since there is nothing here, there is only one possibility."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gail chin slightly lifted up and said: His soul has been sublimated and redeemed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Self-sublimation? It turns out that at the moment of suicide, I feel that I have achieved perfection and peace. Nian Tongda, no concern, he completed his own redemption through suicide." Su Ge said at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, Su Ge has made up a lot of books and knowledge related to the priests, including the explanation and description of self-sublimation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French Hank’s ear readings also know a little, looking down at Macock’s body: “This is the only reasonable explanation.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others heard that it was weird, but I couldn’t think of other explanations.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Things come here, it’s also A definitive answer was submitted to this matter.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer is, although the answer is more and more confusing.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Helping Roland out of the morgue.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since you know her, take her to your place for a while." Let's go. When she is in a stable mood, she will be sent out. Father Harden said.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded and took Roland to the Purple Moon Church.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;On the road.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Macock is a very masculine and arrogant person, and he is a devout brilliance church believer. In the teachings of the Glorious Church, suicide is the absolute most incompetent behavior. His death is definitely not suicide. Roland clenched his fist and whispered.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge heard some accidents and thought about it: "Is Makok's father still alive?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland shook his head and said: "His father died three years ago." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge brows his head and asks: "What did he mean when he said sorry for his father?" Did his father put a lot of expectations on him when he died? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland thought and whispered: "The father he said may be his godfather." His godfather is very good to him, and he and his godfather are very people who pay attention to the face. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is his godfather? Su Ge hurriedly asked.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mayor Arnold." Roland said a very shocking name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this name, Su Ge’s heartbeat, because he suddenly thought of what happened to Gerlos before, the ghoul became the Minister of Finance of the Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't want to think about it. Mayor Arno is a very good person. He is easy-going and kind, and is a kind-hearted elder," Roland said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded without a trace and said: "Go to my break first, then I will send you out."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland shook his head and refused, the brilliance of his eyes flashing in his eyes: "I am not vulnerable to this point. I know that if the church is responsible, I am not qualified to ask questions, but I have to thoroughly investigate. The reason for Markak’s death, this matter must be clarified!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Roland’s appearance, Su Ge did not stop, quietly sent her out of the church. respectively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the back of Roland’s departure, Su Ge’s heart said: “This thing seems to have become clearer and clearer, but it’s still low-key, silently accumulating power. I hope that my growth will keep up with their plans."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After sending Roland, Su Ge came back and met the Anthony Father who had just returned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the situation with the clinic?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Anthony sighed: "It’s terrible. I found a total of twelve bodies. The bones that have been dull become carrion, and the nearest missing population. Check it out, all match."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded, and he randomly opened his mouth to tell the news he heard from the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the moment of opening his mouth slammed back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When the black man is gone, his power still exists here. Mayor Arno has a lot of suspicion now. Maybe there is also in the church. The man's minions, after all, there are some loopholes in the review of the church. I think there should be a few 25-year-olds like me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, he can only temporarily leave this secret. Otherwise, if you rush out and say it, it may cause some people that he can't resist people's attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong?" Father Anthony asked curiously when he saw Su Ge's words and words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh! I want to ask if there is any mysterious relic in this incident. I immediately thought that this thing is not what I should have asked, so I swallowed it back." The technique of lying lies more and more skilled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony said: "Don’t look at yourself too much, your authority is still not small. This thing is qualified to know."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The mysterious relics are there, but I didn't see them. It was discovered by Mr. Rogan. It seems to be a big eyeball similar to the human head. Mystery is not high, only It has some influence on apprentices and ordinary people, and they are caught in the illusion of fear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mysterious relics are remnants of some special mysterious events. These remnants can be anything, eyes, wooden combs, clothes, even dirt, stones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are mysterious materials, or can be made into mysterious costumes, or ready-made secret treasures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The typical example is the burning green skull in the previous sacrifice. According to the standard measured by the secret treasure, it is at least a five-level secret treasure, second only to The "Giant worms praise song" in the hands of the black man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony went on to explain: "According to the identification, this is a semi-mysterious costume. After the handover, it can become a mysterious costume of the illusion system. The level should be about two levels. It’s a good harvest.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s thought of the big eye last night, the heart said: “The battle here is not completely hopeless. At least some materials and equipment can be exploded."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How young, are you interested in mysterious items?" Anthony asked with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug does not deny the nod: "Well, I have recently read some books about mysterious items, and I have gained a lot. So I have a strong interest." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
