			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that Gerlos became this form, the sound of the sound suddenly shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She clearly felt that Gerlos had now gone beyond the human form and entered a new form she did not know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Randall and others are very calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although they are the first to see this state of Gerlos, they all know that this is the Lord’s endowment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So no matter how unfamiliar this state is, it is normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because, the power of the Lord is endless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerez here holds the hand on the railing of the cage, spits a cold visor in his mouth, whispering: "The hunter of conquering countless worlds Please give your loyal servant a freeze on the blazing blaze of the spirits!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, the invisible power was injected into the emptiness from the void that people could not understand. body of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A suffocating moment, even the cold of the frozen soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Back!" Randall slammed forward and opened his arms to hold Hills and Sonic, and Jenny was behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be clearly seen that on the silver-white fence, a burst of white frost spread from Gerlos’s hands to the sides of the railing. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My God, this is at least minus three Baidu!" The sound waves widened and the look was full of shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This...this temperature is far from being able to reach even frost."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She and Frost are the girlfriends who have nothing to say, and they are very familiar with the strength of the Frost Witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the strength of today's Frost Masters, the cold that can be created is barely able to reach zero. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zero three Baidu, this is simply the power of the lord level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only way to project and use your knowledge in a deeper rule structure is to create such a terrible low temperature out of thin air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This temperature is terrible, even if it is protected by Randall, the two men have hair in between, and the eyebrows are covered with white frost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nod your head when you are alive," said Gerlos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The frost nodded slightly, indicating that it can withstand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the two steel railings have changed from normal silver gray to a kind of white like a dead skin, with a lot of strange lines on it. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound waves that are sensitive to sound clearly hear the subtle sounds of the two railings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The physical structure of chrome-silver steel is changing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calling! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Gerlos breathed a sigh of relief and said with a slight exhaustion: "Hills, break them."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hillsron came forward directly, and lifted his foot and squatted on a railing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哗啦啦! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This foot goes down, the entire railing is like a glass, which bursts directly on the ground and becomes a scattered and sharp ice crystal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this what you are not very cold-resistant? The normal mysterious material can withstand minus two Baidu is already a very good cold-resistant material." The sound wave said with amazement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hoarfrost gradually receded, and Jerouss took out the pipe full of ice slag: "The child thinks that the sturdiness is completely different from what the adults think is sturdy." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hills has another foot here, and after another railing has been smashed, there has been a gap that can pass through a person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Hills went in, he was covered with black lines, only his nose and mouth were exposed, like a black mummy frost, and he did not directly help her loosen: "Apostle, then?" /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go! Let's plan for the next step." Gerlos said with a pipe, and quickly left with everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the ancient city, Su Ge is not slow at this time run. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind him, there are hundreds of mutated villagers and mad descendants chasing him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But their footsteps are completely unable to catch up with Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While running, Su Ge released the night clock and left the surrounding structure in his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole mountain city is built on the hillside. Su Ge runs along the steps of the street, and the three monsters open the monsters. It is the city. internal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My God!" When Su Ge pushed the door of the inner city, some of them did not return to God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This and the neat outer city are completely two worlds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a weed on the broken ground, full of blackened bodies and blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the beam of the house that was burned over the road, hundreds of bodies were hanging from the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be seen that these bodies were once human, but turned into full-length monsters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole body is bloody and dry, looks miserable, and looks ugly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body is hung upside down on the wall by a rope or a pair of feet, or is stretched around the neck and hung on the beam. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the scalp is numb, full of surprises and horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge walked carefully and found more monster bodies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These should have been made by the residents here, but now they are all killed by some people, piled up here, seems to be warning, or are proclaiming what. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After about a hundred meters ahead, stand on the ground and look around to see the roofs of many buildings, as well as the church bell tower and watchtower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The place where he stands is a relatively high place. Looking down from here, you can see that all the buildings in front are built below, understandable For the next level of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The left side extends forward to the porch in front of a house. Through the porch you can enter a burnt-down complex. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right side is the roof and cornice that connects the underlying buildings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time there are also many battle marks and many bodies on the cornices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On these bodies, some black crows are licking them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crows are three or four times larger than the normal crows, and there is one meter long standing there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because they are too big, they can’t fly at this time, they can only slide for a short time like a hen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crows that feed on mutant human corpses have not only changed their body shape, but also changed their body structure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two white eyes, swelling and bulging, like two white meat balls, very disgusting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no hair behind, the pale flesh has rotted, and even the spine and the strange spurs that grow through the flesh are seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the eye swept, Su Ge took a deep breath: "Damn, even if my brain is bigger, I didn't expect such a tragedy." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This city is no longer a city of humanity, but hell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗷呜呜呜......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Su Ge hesitated to move on, the sorghum, the penetrating and warlike wolf came again howl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looked down at the sound, his eyes instantly locked in a tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There should be a clock tower, but the house of the clock tower and the surrounding walls have been blown up, and now there is only one floor about 100 square meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The walls of the clock tower are covered with a variety of mutant monsters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These monsters are all changed by the inhabitants here, at this time, they are unrecognizable and disgusting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the top floor, a lot of bodies have been stacked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the body, there is a body-blooded figure and a white wolf with a weak fluorescence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man wore a close-fitting iron armor with no visible color, and had a short cloak behind him. He held a one-meter-and-a-half-long broad sword in one hand. Holding a short sword that is only half a meter long in one hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a mask on his face, can’t see it, and has a blood-red wolf seal on his left chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his shoulder, each has two shoulder guns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, that’s right! It's like something on the shoulder of a steam bot, but these two are very small and flexible, just like his other hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a short knife on his elbow and a long thorn on his knee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even the roots of the boots have serrations that can easily cut the flesh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A chain of iron around his waist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chain is hung with all kinds of things, including darts, grenades, bombs, kits, holders, axes, etc. It is armed to the teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wolf next to him was almost the same as Lobo, to his waist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This wolf does not seem to belong to this world. It is warm and white, emitting special fluorescence, fighting in countless monsters, but not contaminating any blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, one person and one wolf are like a soul and a double body. The incomparable tacit cooperation kills all the monsters who climbed the tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge can’t see if they are tired or how long they have been killed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But from the wolf he heard that he seems to have fallen into desperation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, Su Ge wants to help him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not a bad person who helps others indiscriminately, but he wants to help him at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he is a member of the Wolf Legion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he is the person who knows the most insane things here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking around, the left side will be closer through the porch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there are a lot of wandering monsters there, and rushing in is killing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Su Ge chose to go from the roof on the right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the distance, the soldier seems to be a little weak, and a mistake is hit by a monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the armor has a strong defense. After a little two steps back, the sword is cut into two sections with a sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Wolf Blood Legion appears here, and it is still a lone wolf, which means that there is something related to the abyss, but the initial evaluation level and Not so high, so only this person was sent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But after entering the city, he found the problem serious, and wanted to go back and found that he could not go back." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the story of Su Ge brain supplement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flying to the top of the house, not far from the two black crows who were eating the monster's body, immediately turned their heads, then screamed for a while Incomparably screaming, fluttering his own wings and flying a meter high toward Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge didn’t want to waste too much psionic power at this time, so his cane became a body that directly entangled the chain sword form. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the splash of feathers and flesh and blood, this big crow died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body rushed forward to escape the attack of the second crow, and Su Ge’s cloak exploded, like a batman’s cloak turned into a huge wing. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wings flapped a few times and actually took Su Ge for about three meters and landed on the roof opposite the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!?You can fly!?" Su Ge looked at the accident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the cloak is constantly undulating, as if a person is breathing like a fierce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that with Su Ge flying so far, it has exhausted it exhausted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, you're here! I don't care!" Sug sighed and continued to move quickly along the roof. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The roof is much safer than the ground, except for a small number of stupid crows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the way forward, Sug looked down at the street under the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, on this dark and damp street, there are hundreds of thousands of villagers, just like the city of Bain, those who saw the giant worm Like crazy people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have no self-awareness, squadrons, wandering around the city with eccentric weapons, patrolling, and destroying all the foreigners who still have reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, what surprised Su Ge is that not everyone in this city has become a monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the way to run, he used the night bell to look at the situation in these houses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some relatively complete houses, closed doors, iron fences on the windows, three gray chandeliers at the door, and sensible humans inside . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but these people didn’t mean to go out and hide in the room waiting quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug is not interested in talking to these people at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the black cloak is too tired to fly, Su Ge can only use the assassin master assist system modified by Ivan to fly the wall, through the roof slightly Go back some distance and quickly approach the tall clock tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clock tower is about five meters taller than other buildings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Su Ge came to the roof closest to the clock tower and looked down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of monsters around the entire clock tower is not too much, and Su Ge found that there are not many monsters that have the ability to climb from this vertical wall. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This monster attack should be intermittent, otherwise people can't stand this level of attack." Su Ge thought that there is no hurry Go up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Headlined: "Brother, need help?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sound is in this The strange towns full of monsters can be said to be very harsh and out of place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the moment caught the attention of the wolf blood warrior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哗啦啦......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of a large number of monsters was retired, the body-blooded warrior Looking down at Su Ge, he made a hoarse voice: "If you are not afraid of death, come up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you finish, pick up the big sword and turn to continue Killing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge looked around and found that there was almost no monster on the south side of the direct sun, so he patted the cloak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you resting? The goal is there, see you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black cloak I can feel the heart and sight of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contraction stretched two times, it seems to be taking a deep breath, then suddenly opened with a Su Ge and flew up the wall above the slope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The house where he stands is about six meters away from the clock tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cloak is now very limited in its ability to fly a few meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge’s mind took a chance to inject some psionic energy into the black cloak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this moment, the cloak is like a fuel-less engine that has been injected with gasoline. The whole momentum and power are not just comparable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It turns out!" Su Ge’s eyes were shining, and at this moment he finally knew the true role of the cloak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I said! This holy grail document can't be so firewood!" Su Ge thought of the beauty of the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although only enough psionics can be injected, the cloak can fly up with Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the spirit of saving psionics, Su Ge stopped the cloak as he approached the wall, and the claws at the wrist caught the edge, double The foot ran on the wall and ran quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dexterous turn over, you see the mutated inhabitants of the cockroach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s body followed by a dodge, and kicked the mutant resident out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time there are about twenty monsters fighting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a sword flew a monster, the wolf-blood warrior kneeled on the ground with one hand and his hands held the giant sword to breathe vigorously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge looked out, his body was shaking violently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the monsters around the world seized the opportunity to quickly get trapped, and Su Ge suddenly stepped forward, and the shock wave suddenly broke out, bringing together the dozens of villagers on the ground. The body was pushed straight down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hand cane becomes a chain sword, and with the arms of Su Ge dancing, it instantly turns into a sly whip flying in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few minutes, the remaining dozens of villagers were physically broken and scattered on the floor full of blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Su Ge was preparing to continue to kill, the attack stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white wolf turns into a streamer into the body of the wolf blood warrior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Wolf Blood Warrior slowly lay on the ground, slowly moving his limbs, alleviating this exhausted body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger stood on the side and did not speak. He looked at the brows on the ground around his body and frowned. Then he pushed the bodies around him down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Say you brave, or do you say that you are reckless?" The wolf blood soldier looked at Su Ge, who was silently cleaning up the body, and suddenly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger said casually: "The courage and recklessness are only one difference. The standard of evaluation of this thought is not the beginning and the process, but the result."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Wolf Blood Warrior is silent and introduces himself: "My name is Andrew Bruno and belongs to the Third Army of the Wolf Blood Legion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Sug Sotos, a bishop of the Church of the Holy Blood who is about to be betrayed by the church." Su Ge said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brown eyes under Andrew's mask are very calm: "This kind of thing is not once or twice. For the March church, this is normal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Normal?" Suger’s unexpected question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrew said faintly: "It's normal again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge heard a smile: "Then I feel a lot more comfortable."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Suge looked around: "The view here is really good, and the mountains are small."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't tell me that you are here for sightseeing." Andrew didn't want to move at the moment, only his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course not, I am here to save people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are you talking about?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Save me?'<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your kindness, but I still have to say that you are really nosy." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of such an answer, Su Ge is speechless.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrew moved his finger slightly , pointing to the direction of Su Gelai: "I have come all the way from there, come here, do you really think I will be trapped here? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Su Ge thought about it and did feel that there was a certain problem with the logic.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just can't go. Andrew said calmly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are normal people in the city." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know, but not far from madness." Su Ge is honest.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrew replied: "But after all, it is normal." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, in this way, you attract most monsters with a strong desire to attack, thus protecting those who survive? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrew nodded and didn't speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s stupid." Su Ge was very rude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrew doesn't mind, calmly said: "Stupid is not necessarily a bad thing, stupid methods are always the most direct method. And often in many cases, The most direct method is often the most effective method."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrew is right, at least from the results, the people in the city are still alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How long have you been here?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Eighteen days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you been sleeping for 18 days?" Su Ge asked in shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Andrew calmly replied: "Total sleep for twenty hours, rest forty hours."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Suge counted, on average, counted down to sleep every day, it will be a little more than two hours. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is far beyond the limits of humanity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are such a madman." Su Ge's honest evaluation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrew’s body is shaking regularly, and the sound is smoothly explained: “We’ve been fighting for the perennial and abyss in the wolf, and in the place where we don’t see the sky, we’re being monsters. The long-term encirclement of the group is a very common thing. It is a common practice to fight for one or two months in a continuous high-intensity battle. This is nothing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s heart is shocked, Then he sighed: "Your army has always been mysterious, and few people know your situation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We carry an unknown curse, can be less and Other people's contact is the best.” Andrew said, sitting up slowly, taking off the oval helmet, revealing a pair of brownish-yellow skin, full of vicissitudes of middle-aged faces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It looks like forty years old, looks ordinary, has a light blue short hair, and the chin is full of blue scorpion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were three scary scars on the left face, and it seemed that the attack almost shattered his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Taking a deep breath, he slightly moved his stiff neck and asked, "Is the three churches finding a problem?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded: "The coalition is outside, not just the Church of the Holy Blood, the glory, the cold, the elves are coming, there are many other small organizations and adventurers."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrew stood up and walked over to open a small box, took out a bottle of water and brown bread, and asked, "Either?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug shakes his head and eats in this stinking place, he will vomit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Andrew snorted in the blood, chewed it thinly, swallowed it, and then drank a few mouthfuls of water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg wants to sit down and look around and find that there is blood everywhere, so he stands and looks into the distance: "Why are the bodies lifted?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andy swallowed the bread and explained: "A deterrent, the villagers become monsters also have instinctive fears, blocking the exit with those bodies, they I won’t go outside the city.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looked at the thousands of bodies that were being hung there and sighed: “I can’t imagine you. How do you complete this level of killing by one person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrew silent for a moment, faintly said: "I am just a sinner in the world, except for killing me. Others."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A lot of things that seem complicated are not complicated, as long as you have enough patience and time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Coincidentally, I have both of these points."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looked at him and whispered: "Lonely Is it not afraid of death when one comes here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Death is not terrible for me as a lone wolf. The terrible thing is that death is meaningless." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
