			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three people walking side by side on the street. Ada walks in front very carefully and does not bother the three. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack was fortunate to say: "I finally found you. We have been to your house for several days. I want to seek your help, but you There has been no one in the family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suglo apologized: "Sorry, I have been living in the Church of the Holy Blood for a while, and rarely go home. Ada also lives in the monastery and forgets to tell you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Living in the Church of the Holy Blood? Really envious!" Jack said with a look of envy. Randomly came to the topic: "Since today I met, I will help Roland, Su Ge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Jack came over and whispered: "She The fiancé’s situation is very weird now.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge turned to look at the sly Roland and asked: “It’s been a while for your fiancé. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland is shocked: "How do you know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From the majority Your month ago God trance, people can notice a little careful. "Said Su Ge arbitrary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack listened, and some embarrassed scratched his head because he didn't notice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s calm question: “Talk about the situation.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland hands pinched The corner of the clothes whispered: "My fiancé started about a month ago. Because I usually work very busy, we don't have much time to meet. The day we ate at dinner to discuss marriage is that he suddenly took us. After the marriage was postponed, I said that I have a very important thing now. I have no time at the moment. I was not very happy at the time and had a fight with him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug Head, indicating that she will continue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because there was a fight, we were less likely to see each other the following week. I calmed down and thought about it, knowing that I was not quite right at the time, so I Go to his clinic to find him, the result..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, Roland couldn't help but squeeze the palm of his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug did not speak, wait for her to continue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland was silent for a while and took a deep breath and said: "I saw him licking the skin of a female corpse."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack seems to have known, and there are not many surprises. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is still calm and asks: "After?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High days Intensity learning, Su Ge has completely entered this secret world world through books, and the whole human eye, mentality, and endurance have not been the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you have the confidence to master everything, you will have the calmness of not being surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug is now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this mysterious case, he has seen hundreds of cases in the book, and has simulated many times through the reverse of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Su Ge’s calm and indifferent look, Jack sighed in his heart: “It’s not a person who entered the Church of the Holy Blood, even if it’s not long, the inner world. It’s not at the same level as us.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland continued: “I was scared at the time, and I sneaked away when he didn’t find me. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He found me that night and calmly explained to me why he was delaying the wedding. He looked normal at the time, nothing special. I was then Believe that you have made a mistake, it has passed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After our relationship returned to normal, I always felt that he was quietly changing. Although his The conversation is still as it was before, but I often find inadvertently that he really has a sneer in his mouth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After..." Speaking of this, Roland was a little trembling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack patted his good friend’s shoulder and continued: “After ten days, two people had a relationship with Roland after a dinner. After being rejected by Roland, he suddenly became angry. Not only did he fight Roland, but he also prepared qj her. Fortunately, Roland's body escaped very well in time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The next day he cried and ran over and hugged Roland's legs and prayed for her forgiveness. He said a lot of good words to appease Roland. But five days ago, she almost rushed her again. This time he did not apologize, but instead changed. It’s getting more and more violent, and even threatening Roland to kill his parents.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge heard the brow wrinkled and said: “This thing requires the police. Come out?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack sighed and said: "His fiancé, Macock is an aristocrat, his family was the beginning of the pioneering city of Bain. One of the four major families. Because they have special privileges, they can prevent the police from managing things within their family. Roland belongs to the Bowman family, one of the four major families. Although it is a collateral, it is still within the four family. We have no right to interfere."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And, Roland’s parents...compared...compared, they think Roland should obey Macock, which is good for Their marriage contract is on the side of Markoc for this matter."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Su Ge nodded and said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Berland Empire is a legal state, some ancient families with special status do have many special privileges, which are common throughout the Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the question of Markoc reported to the church?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland shook his head and didn't speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack continues to explain: "This family scandal is very taboo for all big families. Roland is in the system after all. So we want to ask For a good friend to help us to see, what happened to Macock, how suddenly it became so violent, is not affected by what mysterious things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Su Ge listened to his heart and said: "This should be a small incident that is affected by some mystery. The threat should not be great. It is just that I am now successful in learning. It is also a good choice to practice this thing. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Su Ge nodded and said, "No problem, but I need to prepare, and you need to guide him to a relatively quiet place." The current symptoms can be simply judged by what he seems to be possessed by something, or influenced by something. At that time, if the expulsion ceremony is carried out, there may be a lot of movement."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
