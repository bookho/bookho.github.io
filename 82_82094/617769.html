			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis of Grasse, it doesn't look too busy, everything is as usual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a legendary general who hates the church, there is no statue in the entire mansion and anything in the church in March. The whole house is low-key and luxurious, but there is no theology. The style is bloated and cumbersome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge has no interest in architecture, and all buildings are only a few in his eyes, such as style and style. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He’s feeling for the Admiral’s house is: very style. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the guidance of Moggs, two people walked across the square to the mansion along the main entrance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This suddenly caused shock and surprise to many servants around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people are almost all old servants of the generals who serve the generals for generations. They know that those who are qualified to go directly from the right way and the honor square are for the generals. Very important, the big man who sits on the same level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, in the arrangements of the past few days, it seems that there is no preparation and notification for the guests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of three walked down the gate and went to a grand classical hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three did not stop, and went down the stairs on the left to the third floor of the castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge while using the evening bell to scan the structure of the entire house, while determining the mystery in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What surprised Su Ge is that there are not many mysteries in the entire manor, most of them are ordinary people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley was very pleased with this very grand house, and said to Su Ge: "I will live this way later."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Moggs on the side heard this look, and said in his heart: "This one is really laid-back, and it is chased by the church, and actually carries a female companion." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge said in a circle: "The problem is not big, but it takes some time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well." Shelley nodded with satisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the speech, three people stopped in front of one door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moggs opened the doorway: "Two please, my host is waiting for two."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sug smiled and nodded and turned and walked in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a living room of about 60 square meters, at which time there are two middle-aged people on the sofa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two people sat straight at the same time, and they looked like heroes. They all came out from military sources. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Su Ge on the left knows exactly what General Green had seen in the dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on the right, Su Ge also knows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but he only saw it from the newspaper,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because this is true The great man, the most ideal lover in the dreams of countless young ladies and nobles in the Empire: the head of the Shining Holy Knights, Admiral Kos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This young, well-positioned, romantic and handsome general has a higher reputation than General Green, which is a household name. It is the mantra of every parent to motivate children. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seeing Su Ge two people walked in, the two stood up at the same time, Green smiled: "Finally met again, Mr. Assassin." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled and said: "I am honored to really know you, Admiral Grasse."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, the two men shook hands with enthusiasm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the success line, Sug turned and said: "This is my fiancee, Azshara Assass."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fiancée?" Something unexpected in Green's heart, turned around and looked at Su Ge's introduction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, seeing this ordinary woman is very arrogant, standing there cold, not ready to speak, not ready to salute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the scene was a bit embarrassing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge gently coughed and said: "My fiancée, not an ordinary person, so I don't understand these things, I am really sorry."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not ordinary people..." The two men didn't get too much tangled when they heard this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green said sideways: "You should have heard of the name of this friend of mine, I will not introduce it."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugarton’s face with a smile of admiration said: “Of course, the name of General Coase can be said to be as good as it is in our city of Bain!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coswenya smiled and reached out and said: "There are things that reporters report too much, and the credibility is not high, don't care."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the conversation, four people sat down, and Green’s face solemnly said: “First of all, thank you for your help to Markak on the Saronic. Without you, the consequences cannot be imagined.”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge picked up the hot aromatic coffee and asked: "Macock has said everything?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Green nodded: "Well, Macock is my former deputy. I have helped me to care for the Saroni these years. Losing them is an unbearable loss for me." Brs /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The side of Coase took the words, his face said unsatisfactory: "It is hard to imagine that this group of crazy cults dare to hold a summoning ceremony on this ship."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge licked his lips and said with a leisurely tone: "Don't underestimate human desire for something, that craving is the most horrible and fanatical."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green said with agree and nodded: "It’s true, I used to fight the dead spirit of Vikulas, and those horrible things have surpassed the desire for flesh and blood. The fear of everything else is the most horrible to reach this point."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coase looked at Su Ge's appearance and then smiled and said: "Mr. Assassin's Yi Rong is really strong. I carefully observed a circle and found no flaws?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug heard a slight smile: "It’s just a little trick."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said, he looked at Green, with a hint in his eyes dissatisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green is still calm, and the words explain: "I know what you mean. But don't get me wrong, for me, Coase is absolutely trustworthy. We two People are serving a great person together. This great person also has a lot of dissatisfaction with the church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this Su Ge brows a look at Coase . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coase narrowed his eyes like a colorful snake, and asked in a deep tone: "Do you know what it means?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg listened to the silence, then laughed: "I like people who are refreshed, and I like direct people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The meaning of the two people is obvious, is to showdown to Su Ge, clearly indicating their attitude and force field, while deterrence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The intelligence is right, the emperor of the empire does have a very strong dissatisfaction with the church." Su Ge said in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two people who are so close to trust and who serve at the same time, there is only one, naturally the emperor of the strongest empire on the mainland today, that is, today His Majesty the Emperor of the Rand Empire: Revodin III. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s said that it’s quite straightforward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Su Ge raised his right hand slightly, and a glimmer of light flashed, and the disguise on his face and Shirley disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two people who are not surprised to see this approach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the two people saw the appearance of Shirley, their hearts were suddenly shocked, and just doubts and dissatisfaction were relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
