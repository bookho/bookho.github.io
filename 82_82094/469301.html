			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three people stared at Griffin, their faces were very gloomy and they were not good. Silence for a moment, the young man whispered: "My name is Joel Mick, the bright judge of the Glorious Church, who was ordered to pursue this woman warlock heresy. The blood church and the shining church itself are cooperative. Do you not only help arrest, but even want to stop? Do you want to be burned to death by this deputy bishop?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to some hesitation, Reifen immediately replied strongly: "Since the site of our Holy Blood Church, we must go through the process of our Holy Blood Church. You are directly here to arrest people, even without the authority of the relevant church. Approval, do you really think of this as your own parish?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Griffin has been in the church for many years, for this and related things The document policy is very well understood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what makes Suge say that Sug does not know how to speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joer’s face suddenly sinks: “A deputy bishop is not qualified to organize a bright judge at the level of the master, go and go! Otherwise, don’t blame me! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, move on and prepare for the hard work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theirs themselves are not pursuing this female warlock, their real purpose is to track a witch through the Berant Empire to the north, so as Griffin They said that they did not have relevant permission approvals because they themselves did not intend to do so in the area of ​​the Church of the Holy Blood. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who knows that the Holy Blood Church’s enthusiasm for the body of the witch, if they rushed, even if they caught the witch, they would not take it back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for this female warlock, I just found it by chance when I passed by, looking at the good looks, catching the cool and cool to get rid of the goods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Griffin heard this, his face showed a sneer, it seemed completely fearless, standing there and motionless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joer whispered: "Do you want to die?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's you who are looking for death." Su Ge said at this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joer turned his head and looked at Su Ge with his eyes open. After feeling the extraordinaryness of Su Ge, he was slightly alert and whispered: " Who are you?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Griffin with a respectful introduction: “This is our bishop, Suger Sotos.”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Joel and the two attendants were surprised at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name is no stranger to them. When the news that was originally appointed came out, people were surprised at the performance of Emilia and also noticed this. A bishop who is not known. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the detailed investigation of the detailed information, they all felt that the young people who were only 24 years old were shocked and surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is shocking is that Su Ge is the youngest bishop in recent decades. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difference is that such an ordinary university graduate, the students who have been peaceful before, how suddenly became a bishop after joining the church for half a year? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But most people are skeptical and scornful, thinking that Suge is a relationship, or the illegitimate child of a big man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in conversations between churches and related mysterious worlds, Su Ge has become the "most of the last few decades" in their mouths. Nirvana's illegitimate child." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seeing Su Ge today, Joel immediately discovered that there was a big deviation between the drama and the rumors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because, casually, no one can connect this sophisticated, calm and restrained youth with the rumored illegitimate child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For such people, there are only two extreme situations, one is waste in waste, and the other is genius in genius. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first glance, Joel determined that this Sotos bishop is not a waste, then it is a genius! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A long time heard of the name of Bishop Sotos, you are as rumored, handsome, kind and easy-going." Demeanor, tone of respect, and just the cold is like two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joel is scornful, but can do the position of the bright judge, proving that his emotional intelligence and IQ are not low. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looked like Joel, who was like a tiger, and put down his gesture, smiling and saluting: "Long time, the main church of Mick speaks, can do things, is near The brightest judges of the most promising years in the past, seeing today, are well-deserved."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In almost an instant, the two just got their swords and even prepared to fight The two dead are like two good brothers, with a smile on their face and very close. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female warlock who is still bound in the back is full of anger and despair in her brown eyes, and her heart swears silently: "Two hypocritical guys! You will definitely not be in the future." Good to die!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Griffin and the two opposite attendants did not care about this change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the level of the bishop, the most important thing is to have a thick skin and to effectively control your emotions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in some cases, someone spits on your face, not only can't get angry, but also through this saliva to judge that the person is a certain person A high-ranking person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the judgment fails, you can’t kill it with anger, but you should use the kind words of kindness: the goddess loves the world, and our servants naturally want to tolerate God. People. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tone should be gentle and gentle, and the expression should be kind and harmonious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally here, the next step is bound to applause and be grateful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I heard that the territory of Bishop Sotos is the entire Guinness Kingdom. How are you here today?" Joel asked tentatively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug casually smiled: "The Archbishop Emilia needs some help from me, and now I’m done, just go back."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joel listened to his heart and said: "I heard that the sacrifice of blood was taken away by him. It seems that the information is not wrong."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The noble light How can the judges carry two people here in the wilderness? This is too dangerous. There are many dangerous cults near the border." Su Ge asked seriously and toned sincerely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joel smiled and replied: "Of course it is to chase this heresy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"哼Hey! Less talk there, you are here to follow the witch, I really don't know? You chased Ada Newton for so long, it must be important news!" This female warlock knows that she can't run today. Now, directly tell Joel's important purpose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Looking for death!" Joel was furious after listening, turned and pulled out the lightsaber, and a glare of light appeared suddenly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge waved with his hand, and the evening bell was added to protect the moment on the side of the female warlock, blocking this deadly sword light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the meaning of Bishop Sotos?" Joel still smiled on his face, but the smile was a bit stiff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge’s eyebrows said with pity: "God loves the world, and all beings are the people of the goddess. Anyone has rehabilitated and self-redeemed." Opportunity. This female warlock does not seem to be a wicked person, so kill the non-goddess."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Women can not believe in the March goddess For this kind of leader, you should scoop up the roots." Joel answered immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is still calm: "She does not believe in the March goddess, but does not mean that she is not a child of the March goddess, they are only blinded by some people. His own eyes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joer's attitude gradually became cold: "Are you planning to be a bright and unconventional?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiles and responds: "God's servants should shelter every God's people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joel slowly squeezed the lightsaber in his hand, his face was cold: "Bishop Sotos, you are playing with fire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge looks the same, Like a kind old priest: "Mr. Mick, please come back, this lost lamb will return to the embrace of the goddess under the guidance of the Church of the Holy Blood."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Joel doubled his eyes on Su Ge for two minutes, and did not rush to get rid of the lightsabed: "The Bishop Sotos is always careful, as you said, the border is not very peaceful."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your concern, I will pay attention." Su Ge still smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Joel’s three departures, Griffin sighed with relief: “Fortunately, I didn’t fight.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He should be a special occupation held by the Glorious Church, let the Holy Sword make it?" Su Ge turned and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Griffin nodded: "Well, the sacred sword makes it very powerful for the control of light, it is very tricky. This master's sword makes The combat power, in the entire master class, is considered superior."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Sword is a secretive profession, injecting light through the gift of the Glorious God The soul is combined with the weapon, so that the sword of brilliance with a very large lethality can be used. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sword is also one of the few secret professions that can be copied and used in large quantities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looked at Joel in the distance and spit out a breath, in his current state is not Joel’s opponent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, there are many ways, but after all, they are still experts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After taking the potion, Su Ge can indeed kill some regular master mysteries, but for this master who holds the secret profession, he has no confidence in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a huge threshold for experts to go to the master, otherwise the master will not be so rare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Otherwise, with Su Ge’s dislike of the Shining Church and the mention of Ada, he has already killed these three people, and where And they crap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
