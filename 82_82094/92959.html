			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ward was quiet after the priest left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge looked around through the mattress, the ward was not big, about forty feet. There is only one bed in the room, it seems to be a single room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it so good?" Su Ge curiously dialed the bed and found that there was an operating table with a full metal in the distance. There are bulbs that are not turned on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the side of the wall, there seems to be some steam-filled gears and instrumentation on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These machines are connected to different tubes, or needles, which are placed neatly on the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I thought it was a luxury exclusive room, it was an intensive care unit!" Su Ge licked his mouth and put down the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he doesn't know what the mechanics are, he can still understand some of their uses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yeah!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing these instruments, Su Ge suddenly remembered and reached out and touched it. Touch your heart: "Is this group of guys checking my body and not discovering the secrets of my heart?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Su Ge’s heart first trembled, then Reminiscent of Father Hank’s attitude towards himself: "Well, it seems that they have not found any problems."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, that's right. If true I found out that I would not be lying here for treatment, but I was sent directly to the laboratory." Su Ge gradually settled down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Insurance, wait for a while after the injection, ask the priest Hank."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; After sorting out the situation, Su Ge will fall into the black book of his own hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cover of the book is very simple, except for the five titles written in the inscriptions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The book describing the legendary assassin will be blocked by the Assassin League? How much is this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is curiosity in mind, and Su Ge opens the book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a large blank in the book title page, and two lines of 寥寥 on the khaki paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Every time the bell rings, it means that some souls are released and freed. Only the bells that sound at the funeral represent the sacred and Purification. In many places, the bells of the late bell symbolize the robes of the god of death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turn to the second page, style and layout similar to the first page. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The valley is connected to the realm, in which the concept of life and death has long been blurred. The monsters that walk in it are either inhuman monsters or lost souls. However, they have already stood in the realm. On the top, the people who have achieved great achievements have merged with the valley, and they are also dead and unpredictable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third page of the book, slightly shorter Significantly longer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When the filth is filled with humans, the bell will come out of the valley. Its long ripples will pass to the world, and all hear the sound of the late bells. People will meet death on the third day. Don't resist, release your soul, this is your glory. The death of you is the gospel of the world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The fourth page. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He has been with the night clock for countless years, there is nothing to learn, and there is nothing to understand. The bell is his body, the ripples are His The blade, death is his armor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Page 5. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I... finally saw him... bathed in the sound of the evening bell, the valley is so deep and sacred."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, I entered the long text. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge did not read the text, he closed the book silently at this time, his mind turned over the sea, thinking violently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The bell is his body, the ripples are his sharp edges..." These two sentences are like bombs thrown into the lake, completely exploding the understanding of sound knowledge in Su Ge's mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two sentences represent a new direction, even a new realm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is the name for the saint, or the god, that is, the part of the voice that He may have turned into a voice that can be transmitted through the voice? Wait, this is not something impossible. The sound is the vibration wave generated by the vibration of matter. If you use some other knowledge, analyze the way the sound vibrates, understand the laws of different material vibrations, and master these laws. These vibration waves can be easily stimulated to form an invisible blade."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Su Ge seems to want to understand something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪嗒! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, he seems to hear a weird voice, the next second his forehead suddenly oozes a lot of sweat, and the face that has just returned to blush is pale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hand holding the book is a little trembling, and the fear of the heart comes to mind: "What did I see!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; At the moment, Su Ge found that his own vision suddenly rose by three points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three points, even more than the priests who killed a huge grievance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking down at the books in his hands, Su Ge’s eyes were full of horror, and the spirit began to tremble completely uncontrollably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is definitely not an ordinary book. The former clergyman was crazy because of this book."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, Su Ge grabbed the book and raised his hand to throw it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when he raised it, Su Ge’s face was full of struggles, and the stretched arm could not stretch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The church does not know the extraordinaryness of this book because they do not involve the occupation of sound waves, and this book has been left in the middle of the hospital among ordinary medical personnel. , so it was recycled."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
