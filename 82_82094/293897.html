			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ps: Adding more to the global cold weather of the lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a time, the entire hall fell into a deadly burial ground, only to hear the hard gasping and coughing of the three people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge’s hands are behind him, and he seems to be waiting for something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hills and Vigania came silently to Su Ge’s side, waiting quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About thirty seconds, the door of the second floor was suddenly opened, and Elena rushed out of the door, screaming anxiously : "What's the matter!? What's going on!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The chief of staff, burn them! These three people are the spies of the Duke of the Mountains! They want to assassinate Your Majesty!" At this time, the Honourable Flint said immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes! I also heard it." Mr. Arthur followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gies followed his head and stared at Maria with a threat in his tone: "I also heard that they want to assassinate their majesty."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hills turned his head and made a big scream like a dragon: "Shut up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Flint’s face was pale, and when he got to his throat, he stuck there and couldn’t say anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elena on the second floor jumped down physically and looked at the soldiers who couldn’t move around, watching the three people of the wolf, the cut In two stages, the firearms restored most of the scenes in a flash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maria, is the matter as Mr. Flint said?" Elena turned and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maria then turned back and immediately shook her head: "No, Mr. Flint, they are lying."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You!" Flint, he did not expect that this small housekeeper would dare to tell the truth against them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Very good! Very good!" Gies cold whisper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illina said in a cold tone: "Now there is a chance to tell the truth, Your Majesty and Master Mill are coming over. If Master Mill is known who is lying, The consequences are very clear to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear this, the three people suddenly look white, and then they think of the damn monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Say something simple." Elena turned to ask Maria. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary nodded and said: "Just you are in a meeting, Bishop Sogus took the person back and said that he completed the mission of Master Mill and brought back an important piece of information. The seriously injured assassin, after I and the Bishop Sotos arranged the patient back, I saw that Gis would encircle the two followers of the Bishop Sotos, and then..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simply say something about it, Elena’s face is gloomy, staring at the three people and saying coldly, “Gis, is your courage too big?”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gies’s face is cold and slowly stands up and says: “I’m not too big to judge you, I’m seeing you being confused by this guy, you’ve already divided Unclear truth and falsehood!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You!" Elena pinches her fist, she can't wait to burn this prisoner's guy, but her reason tells her not. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gies has a certain position in the army. He and Jim’s father are former marshals, and two are in charge of a large number of soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two men have been arrogant for a long time, and no one but Vanas can control them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these two brothers, Vanas has already thought about the countermeasures. Now is the key moment, and he decided not to rush with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just in the midst of a dilemma, the crisp sound of high-heeled shoes hitting the marble floor came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All looked up and saw Vanas wearing black pleated sleeves and a black silk dress walking down the stairs with the guard and Mill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's so beautiful!" Vegginia and Hills had their eyes lit at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary and Elena quickly rushed over and said the whole thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mill’s attention is not in the two people’s remarks, the golden erects are slowly sweeping over the shattered firearms on the ground, and the look is flashing a bit. Unsurprisingly, his goal was to fall on the body of Hills, who was next to Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Somewhat!" Bill's mouth was clearly tilted up, revealing a smile full of interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listening to this, Vanas did not control Su Ge first, but came to Gis and two members of the House of Representatives with a smile on the face Personal comfort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then three people turned a lot better, and they snorted at Su Ge, and their eyes filled with grievances. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three guards left after the three left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bishop Sotos, it seems that we need to talk about it." Vanas said coldly, high above. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly: "Follow, Queen Her Majesty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a group of guards Looking down, Her Majesty's cold face is like a prisoner, with these three outsiders returning to the second floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seven people did not go to the living room, but went directly to the study of Vanas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three people on each side, sitting opposite the coffee table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I apologize for what I just did." Sitting down, Vanas said with sincerity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;? ? ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the high-ranking queen suddenly apologized to his pope? This made Sears and Vignia unexpected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge smiled slightly: "I know that you have your difficulties, I don't mind."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Mil immediately asked: "Is this dragon man around you a witch?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge generously nodded and said, "Yes, Hills is me. One of the two witches who rescued in Berant, now ordered by me, just came from the night."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Witch!?" This, Elena and Vanas were both surprised and stared at Hills. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hills was awkwardly seen by two people and asked: "What do you look at me with this look?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illina carefully looked at a circle of Hills, suddenly a kind of intimacy, and turned to look at Su Ge sighed: "No wonder you are not strange to my identity, not afraid of me It’s gone. You’ve already started to take care of the witch!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled and nodded and said: “The income they are also accidental.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well!?" Hills grabbed the point of the matter and stared at Elena and asked, "Run away!? Are you also a witch!?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illina said with a soft smile: "Yes, I am also a witch."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;希Ers immediately grinned with joy, then put away the scales on his body and said, "That's really not easy. After a few months, you are still the first witch I met."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas test Asked: "Mr. Sotos, how did you deal with the safety of the witch? When we were hosting Elena, Uncle Mill helped to deal with Elena's body and conduct regular inspections to prevent Iraq. Lena has a problem. Otherwise, to be honest, I don't dare to be a good sister with Elena."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hills turned to look at Su Ge She is not sure if she should say anything about the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge smiled apologetically and replied apologetically: "Sorry, this is a secret, it is not convenient now."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illina was a bit disappointed, but it was relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
