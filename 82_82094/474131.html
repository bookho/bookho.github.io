			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half an hour, the four soldiers came back with a grey-faced gray face, and a low-pitched voice: "Your Majesty, we... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suggen said: "Poisoned?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leading captain Explain: "We didn't, mainly because the horse seemed to smell something, suddenly mad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The opposite is the alchemist, it is very basic to deal with some horses. I will pay more attention to it later, I don't want to see it for the second time." Su Ge laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four people immediately bowed their heads with respect and nodded their faces. "Thank you for your tolerance and kindness, absolutely not the next time."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When watching the back of the four people, Su Ge touched the smile on his face and sighed: "I still have a good grasp of the Pope's gas field and rewards and punishments. I always think that Treating yourself should be tolerant and seems to be overly kind."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When the Pope, tired." Su Ge suddenly felt tired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the carriage was repaired and the team went on the road again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the road, the carriage has gone far away, and the three thieves are summing up the situation just now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Seeing what you know without seeing it?" asked the young man whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beard brows tightly: "I only feel that there is a psionic fluctuation, there is nothing else."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The wave head moved his ear: "I don't know if it is an illusion, I heard the bells if there are none."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The bell?" The two men looked awkward and said they didn't hear it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wavehead whispered: "It doesn't seem like an illusion, it's a bit too sudden."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "But give us a wake up this time." The moustache said with a dignified face: "Sug Sotos is definitely not an ordinary priest!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The next road was very calm and there was no more incident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no stopping all the way. At 7 pm, Su Ge had returned to his Cathedral of the Holy Blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lying in the classically luxurious bishop's bedroom, eyes looked at the two happily running around in the wide bedroom, leaving their smell in the new home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is estimated that this big house will not live for a long time." Su Ge looked at the dark red wallpaper and murals on the walls, and the luxurious and rare electric chandeliers on his head. There is a spacious bedroom of 60 square meters, and the heart is slightly sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wang Wang! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the two ha ran for a few laps seemed to find something, screaming at the corner with his ice blue eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looked at the corner of the wall and seemed to have found nothing. He touched the head of it: "Oh, don't call."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the two haha ​​turned, a wave of aftermath spread. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aftermath of the range-compressed sweep is as fine as a radar-like sweep across the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, he found a subtle psionic fluctuation in the corner of the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A closer look is a spot that only has the size of a small fingernail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The structure of the spot makes Su Ge invisible, but Suge knows that this spot is not a good thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Su Ge did not do much, go to bed early after taking a shower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dream, I felt the special psionic wave of Vanas, and immediately found a light spot in the sea of ​​grey dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that light point as a goal, Su Ge walked into the dream world and entered the dream of Vanas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the moment of entering her dream, Su Ge felt a strange and distorted cold feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look up, this is a dark and dead world, the land is ridiculous, the grass is not born, the lead clouds in the sky are rolling, heavy depression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the distance, there is a huge valley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are all kinds of bones in the valley, and the ghosts and the undead in the air drift back and forth like a world of the dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge took a step and didn’t know how far it had crossed and came to the valley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking to the inside, the inexhaustible black air is floating on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the breath of the god of death." Su Ge knew immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle of the valley has a throne that is piled up by countless white bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas seems to be sitting in thought at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wannas in the dream is wearing a luxurious and dignified dark dress, which looks like countless deaths and ghosts, full of surprises and majesty. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is covered in a long skirt, showing only the white neck and the glamorous face, the lips are beautiful, and the lips with clear lips are like blood. Bright red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long black hair is soft and smooth, like a black waterfall spread around the throne, looks at least two meters long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black, White, Red, Contrast The three colors that are inconspicuous make Vanas have an indescribable surprise and demon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She leaned back on the throne at this time, her left arm supported the face on the thigh of the throne, and the right hand held a human pale skull to play. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From time to time, there is a black breath overflowing from her fingers, surrounded by the skull, like the goddess of death who masters death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What women are there around me?" Su Ge saw Vanas at this time, and thought of the behavior of Ada before, feeling Some heart is tired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge stood there and did not speak. Vanas seemed to have a slight raise in his senses. The dark eyes fell on Su Ge, and he slowly got up. The body turned into a mist and instantly came to Su Ge, making him cold and lonely. The voice: "I have seen your majesty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she finished, she seemed to feel that her posture and tone were somewhat wrong, and the dark and slender willow eyebrows slightly gathered in the middle. At the same time, it is cold and with a touch of seriousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"See you." She said it again, but it is no different from before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few seconds after silence, she frowned and said, "Your Majesty, I seem to have a problem."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's not a problem, you are merging with the breath of the god of death." Su Ge has long discovered the problem of Vanas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a month ago, Vanas’s temperament began to change slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to be more indifferent and arrogant. The most obvious is the attitude towards Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, she was Su Ge’s most fanatical brain powder, and there was no trace of a queen in front of Su Ge, like a crazy girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But gradually, her attitude changed from fanaticism to normal, calm, and the special feelings for Su Ge are also converging, the temperament and mentality of the whole person happen. Imperceptible changes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, Su Ge only felt a little bit, because the center of gravity was placed on the church, and in self-learning, the change of Vanas was not too concerned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Entering her dreams today, I discovered the roots and importance of the problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of Vanas, or the self-consciousness in a dream, has been unknowingly blending with the god of death who remains in her body. For one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How long has this dream lasted?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It just appeared last night." Vanas replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, she frowned and frowned. She said with a slight thought: "But in the last month or so, I always feel that someone is whispering in my ear. When I sleep, I feel my body is wrapped in something, after that..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She picked up the white skull and placed it in front of her, the white tip of the nose was only a few centimeters away from the skull, and looked seriously: "I suddenly dreamed of this yesterday. The scene, the whisper disappeared, seems to be integrated into my soul. Today it feels completely new, just like a snake skin, very comfortable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug In the heart, "Of course, comfortable, the knowledge and breath of the god of death as a nourishment, is gradually evolving into a high-level life form. If you continue, it may even evolve into a new death god in the future." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas then throws away the skull and raises his head slightly. The dark eyes stare at Su Ge and ask: "Your majesty, I don't feel too much." Yes, I am gradually losing to others. Interesting, and the feeling of being a person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to this, her brow wrinkles deeper, and even the small, narrow nose has some slight wrinkles. Traces, full of seriousness and cuteness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As it is now, I can't have awe in my heart, but instead..." She silenced and organized the language, seemingly immersed in intense thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled and said: "I feel like I am a low-level creature, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;She snorted with a nasal sound, looking at Su Ge with her eyes, like a white jade chin slightly rising, not only did not feel embarrassed, but gave a high of reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looked at the long, silky silky hair on the white bones, and her arrogant and noble manners, he could clearly feel that he just met This meeting, the tone and temperament of Vanas's entire speech is changing with the naked eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be afraid, this is a gradual improvement. You are receiving the knowledge of the Great God of Death. This knowledge has improved your horizons and evolved your mind. Don't have any uneasiness, I can feel that the Lord is happy and gratified by your progress."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, she licked her lips, straight red The lip line matches the white skin, solemn and beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
