			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most direct means of harvesting believers is to show miracles, which is the core means by which Su Ge can continue to harvest faithful believers. He holds miracles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faith is the support and direction of human spirit, but if there is no lasting miracle, then the personal consciousness of believers will grow and time It collapsed and went down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;June is the kind of person in front of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to Jenny’s description, her family generation is a believer in the March goddess, her mother, her grandfather is the bishop of the Church, it can be said that The Pope's family, the real upper aristocracy of the empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She also joined the church from an early age and became a devout believer who was loyal to the March goddess. From childhood to large, she grew up in the church's seminary. It can be said that Church elite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cure the teachings of the church has instilled in her for many years. In her cognition, saving the wounded is the vocation of her job, the basic responsibility of being a goddess believer. Just like her breathing, it is instinct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to better heal the wounded, she became a mystery, her career was a pastor, and she was a veteran surgeon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She can perform surgery in the normal way, and can also guide the power of the goddess to heal the wound through mysterious power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With devout faith and selfless risks, she was quickly promoted to associate bishop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as the position advances, she knows more and more information inside the church, such as prisoners in the dungeon, such as the ever-killed witch, such as Crazy clergyman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of these unhelpful people, she fell into deep self-blame and pain, and began to question her ability and question the teachings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because she found that the goddess of faith in March does not cure all the wounded as the doctrine says, it can keep people away from the pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seeds of doubt have been planted and will continue to sprout. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the days that followed, she was exposed to more secrets and read more real history, especially when she inadvertently saw the black history of healing the church. After that, almost let her fall into madness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She found that healing the church caused far more killing than he cured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And crushing her last straw is the recent witch’s runaway and the variability of the people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proficient in medical skills, she has long known that the problem of the witch is sarcoma, not the witch itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is eager to cure the witch, she prays without interruption, does not eat or drink, and hopes that the goddess of March will give her the ability to heal the witch with her most sincere attitude. Even if you use your own life to heal a witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the March Goddess did not respond to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ironically, just the day before, the visiting Archbishop also praised her piety and said that she would be able to receive the blessings and blessings of the goddess in such a sincere attitude. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This made the experience so that the three days did not go into the water, and Jenny, who was not sleeping, prayed, and the faith began to burst. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After restoring health, the public began to go mad, and she joined the agency that managed the hostages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, they were deprived of their authority when they were ready for treatment, and the mutants were all killed without receiving any treatment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jenny was blinded for a long time, her faith completely collapsed, and she almost went out of control and went crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, she found out the magic book her father had given her and summoned Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to these, Su Ge’s heart is filled with emotion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jenny’s experience is typical of a simple cleric’s fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her experience is very similar to the original Bishop Ron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that she summoned Su Ge when she was about to turn over, and Ron didn’t have anyone to guide him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What should I do under the Pope? Is that kind of person who is not determined? Or is it that I am destined to be a traitor who will betray the faith?" "Jenny's tone with confusion and pleading, asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge lifted her up and said calmly: "My child, this is not your fault. It is the healing church that instills the wrong teachings." At the same time, their hypocrisy and cruelty deceive you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Children, your faith is extremely firm, I have seen the most determined church in March. It’s not your problem, it’s their problem.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Suge’s solemn and serious statement: “Your church and Your faith has betrayed you, they have failed your faith, and have failed your sincerity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Jenny stunned, the whole chaos The spirit is like being thundered, and there is a feeling of seeing the clouds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recalling their own steadfastness, recalling their kind teachings and cruel deeds, recalling the March goddess who once again failed to pray for themselves, Jenny I felt a burst of noise in my head, chaos, stagnation thoughts and a year suddenly opened up by an invisible force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, she feels more comfortable than ever before, clearer than ever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes! They betrayed me! It was the March goddess who betrayed me!" Jenny blinked with her eyes, and her tone was firm and firm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight behind him saw Jenny’s transformation, and the face under the mask was worshipped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They all heard Jenny’s complicated mental journey and entangled thoughts. They thought that the Pope would guide her through a lengthy discussion and then make it Get rid of the bondage of the goddess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn’t expect this Pope to say that it’s just two sentences, completely speaking the goddess and the healing church to the opposite of Jenny’s, making it completely Separation of the relationship, but also opened Jenny's heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here Jenny looked up at Su Ge and admired and asked: "What is the teaching of the Lord's Church, can you tell me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge softly nodded and said: "The church of the Lord is called the church of the late bell. The teachings of the church in the late hour are not complicated. We are going to contain and protect the minority groups who are eager to get a normal life, so that they can live happily and happily." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Including and protecting minorities? That minority..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Vampire, undead , female warlocks, witches, etc. These are the objects of our containment and protection. Moreover, the Lord once lowered the power of the gods, and has completely cured the two witches and forever rid themselves of the threat of runaway."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Jenny’s eyes flashed a moment of indescribable light: “The Pope, can I join the church in the evening clock? Your teachings make me feel like I’ve seen a whole new world, great The infinite authority of the Lord made me see new hopes."<br /><br />&nbs Su; did not directly agree, said calmly: "Only true devotion, talents who can give everything to the Lord can join the church in the late bell, I can feel your piety, but you must also Act and express your loyalty and faith in the Lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jenny immediately nodded: "Understand! I understand! I will offer everything to me for the Lord." From now on, the Lord is everything to me, the Lord is my world!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The recent witches have been inexplicably persecuted, which makes the Lord very angry. Because every witch is the main potential child. The three churches should have a lot of information about the witch and this thing. How much do you know?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jenny immediately organized the language and said: "Returning to the Pope, I have not found any problems with the witch, but I found some things on the side of ordinary people. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is there a situation about mutant races?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jenny immediately nodded: "Yes, according to my investigation at the time, combined with the ancient books hidden in our family, I found that the healing church now finds a total of twenty. The commonality of the three variants of ordinary people is that these people are all Byron Dias."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Byron Dias? Isn't this race already extinct?" Su Ge had some surprises. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Byron Dias, the name of the ancient Byronian inhabitants, is also one of the oldest human races. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But according to records, the Byron Dias were completely extinct before the First Dynasty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait! According to Moore’s intelligence, it is said that one of Byron’s sons was sheltered and survived. Could it be said...”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jenny continued: "Yes, the records of the Byron Dias are indeed extinct. This is universally recognized. But after I observed these bodies, I It is hidden to find that the little thumbs of these people's feet are slightly longer, and the nails are embedded in the meat, and the palms of these people are slightly larger than normal people, and the fine lines of the palms, and the Byrondi recorded in my book. The characteristics of the Yass are completely identical."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that the sons of Byron the Great survived and disappeared in the name of the incognito." Su Geran Said, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jenny continued: "According to the records in our church, Byron the Great is the first mysterious human being and mastered the Holy Grail. I think this Is there a relationship with the Holy Grail?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly: "Good analysis, your intelligence is very important, then you continue to pay attention to this Something, after this matter is over, you can join the church of the late bell."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes! His Majesty the Pope!" Jenny said excitedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge turned his head and said: "The Lord's Knight, send the people of the Lord back!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A knight came over and left Jenny with Jenny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the hall, Su Ge regained his body and thought about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If this is the case, everything is fluent. The witch, the Holy Grail, the ancient gods, this variation, Byron the Great, such a shallow relationship. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
