			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people are considered acquaintances. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Su Ge, Emilia’s status is comparable to that of Jeros, who is his own guide, and also a teacher and friend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't expect you to come to me in such a bright future." Emilia said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled and asked: "So, in your imagination, how should I come to you?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After the dragon descends from the sky? Or is the person who led you all the way to preach?" Emilia asked two possibilities in a row. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sughaha smiled and sat up on the opposite side of her desk: "That is to let you down, that an immortal dragon is not something I can control." In addition, I am really disgusted with the traditional way of preaching. It is estimated that this life cannot be what you imagined."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emilia Didn't care, reaching out and picking up the white paper in front of it, above is the beautiful coherent swashbuckle she just wrote. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you writing?" Su Ge asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emilia handed the white paper to say: "Be boring, copying the book."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Suge results paper looked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are seven paragraphs above. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goddess was born from nothing, and they ended their first night, letting people master the light and warmth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goddess opened the chaos, and they ended the second night, giving people wisdom and reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goddess' messenger came to the world, and he ended the third night, letting people greet peace and sunrise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goddess stares at everything, masters some, knows some, we are their children, servants, cherished things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After three nights, people will usher in a true new life, the world will usher in a change, and the glory will flash in the sky with thunder, hope to come to the world like a gust of wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you wish, as I see it, as he thinks, as a life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all things are returned, one is also everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing these words, Su Ge’s spirit slammed and grew a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this?" Su Ge put down the white paper and looked up seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emilia calmly replies: "Introduction to the Secrets of the Three Nevers before the Creation."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge brows slightly wrinkled: "What do you mean by this, I don't understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emilia shakes his head: "I don't understand too much. The content of the secret is very inconceivable. Even there are a lot of ancient proverbs, which can't be deciphered in the present situation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "You have seen some clues since you have seen the secret." Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Emilia brows slightly wrinkled and seems to be using the brain intensely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few minutes later, Emilia said with some uncertainty: "According to the contents of the secret fragmentation, this introduction is a prophecy. It should be a prophecy left by the existence of the Great God."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Great God of Prophecy?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's very possible, otherwise it's impossible to have so many gods." Emilia answered seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What did the prophecy say?" Su Ge's curiosity was hoisted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to the content, "Three Nights Before Creation" people have only experienced two in the history, and the third one is not known to us. The future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge instantly remembered the doomsday theory that Gu Ge said before, and asked: "What else?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emilia shook her head and pointed to a thick piece of white paper next to the desk and said, "I have been studying this for a while. These words, I have already surpassed it thousands of times, hoping to perceive The inner meaning, but unfortunately, there is no progress."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug took up the blank paper, looked at the words seriously, and began to use all the thoughts in the brain and Knowledge is analyzed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this is really difficult to understand, and Su Ge’s situation does not understand what it means here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A moment of silence, Su Ge suddenly asked: "Is this thing related to the witch hunting delay?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Emilia listened and sighed: "Your inspiration is really keen, these two completely irrelevant things are actually instantly associated with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Really there is a relationship?" Su Ge looked a bit surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just thought of it temporarily, just guess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Emilia took the paper from Su Ge and said: "There is indeed concern, these are more than a year ago, by the Pope and three The saints jointly deciphered them. After seeing these things, they seemed to think of a very serious situation, first delaying the time of the witch hunting, and then temporarily closing the maze of blood."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So serious!?" Sug heard this again taking the white paper and watching it carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emilia looked at Su Ge’s serious look, with a soft smile on his lips, as if a big sister was watching his brother’s work. same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Su Ge felt, after a year and a half of imprisonment, Emilia’s mentality and disposition have changed dramatically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it was the previous Emilia, whether it was gesture, smile or tone of speech, it would not be so approachable, make people feel comfortable, unconsciously Relax and be vigilant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg looked at it for a few minutes, and his brow locked: "Are you sure that this thing is not translated wrong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
