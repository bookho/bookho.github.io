			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the control of the authority of Su Ge’s death, the breath and energy of these great gods of death quickly swelled and collapsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four black wings slowly contracted, holding Vanas’ cold body in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, these horrible death scent began to flood into the black clock behind Su Ge, the big bell is a floodgate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the influx of these terrorist forces, the heart under the black robes gradually began to accelerate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the robes, the tentacles that were like black blood vessels stick out and pierce the robes and melt together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge feels his soul, his body is quickly filled with these things. At the same time, a mixture of knowledge resolved through the late bell and his own scattered knowledge of death quickly formed a completely new system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What makes Sugg a bit strange is that this system is actually a new knowledge system based on another occupation: the official. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even, the profession of the official has changed from occupation to knowledge at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only the profession of the gods, but also the ability of Su Ge to hear and let others hear the voice of the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, it is the disillusionment and special spiritual space that Su Ge experienced from the illusion of Oliver. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These things come together like a mess. Fortunately, Su Ge now has the power of the body, and can easily find out the key points, integration and integration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, the gods have the highest level of death knowledge, and everything related to death can be mastered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While integrating knowledge, Su Ge’s body is not idle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remove the gloves and a pair of white hands stick out from the wide sleeves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a burst of strong breath, the blood vessels on Su Ge’s hands quickly turned into lacquered black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, his entire hand was quickly blackened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four wings hold Vanas close to the front, and Su Ge pulls her bra away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the white and straight pair of white rabbits jumped out, and the naughty dithered twice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger’s energy at this time is in the knowledge of death, and there is no response to such a beautiful scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark palms are open and they are very honest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amazing hand feels a little trembling, then quickly returns to normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wrist, on the back of the hand, the raised blood vessels gradually separated from the body, turning into a dark tentacles, piercing them along the white skin of Vanas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately, a burst of infinitely pure death energy was injected into her body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Su Ge’s body is like a purifier. Numerous primitive forces enter through his body, purify through the body, and inject some of the purest energy into Vanas in this way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this pure energy is placed outside, even if it is only one drop, it will make countless mysterious people crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With constant injection, Vanas’ body is still cold, but the wound in the abdomen has completely healed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, Vanas’s sarcoma inside the chest suddenly trembled, and then began to beat at a constant pace like a heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sog seems to feel something here, hurriedly focus on this side, his ear suddenly flashed a whisper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whisper "@¥%@%##..." is not in any language known now, and Su Ge can be sure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, this language has an indescribable twisting power, which makes Su Ge’s thinking suddenly have a strong confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Heaven! My spirit of this form will be affected so much!!" Su Ge flashed his heart at this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, with the constant injection of the breath of death, Su Ge's distorted spirit was repaired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Returning to see the sarcoma, Su Ge flashed a trace of fear: "What is behind this thing, what does it mean!?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, the sound only appeared once and did not appear one after another. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In contemplation, Su Ge felt his hands take a pair of soft, elastic white rabbits to pass a burst of warmth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking up, just to see Vanas’s face full of ruddy, looking at himself with a little shyness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wake up?" Su Ge looked as usual and asked quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas nodded slightly: "Thank you, His Majesty the Pope."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am I made a vow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas flashed a bliss of happiness on his face, then closed his eyes and seemed to have a touch of enjoyment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this, Su Ge’s heart could not help but start to beat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Vanas should be among the women I have seen, and can be ranked in the top three. And this figure is definitely the first." Feel the hands The spirit of the hand, Su Ge has some ripples in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is very respectful to me and should have a feeling of like it. From the current situation, I can easily push her down and make her a woman. ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plopping through... The speed of the heart beats faster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But now is not the time when the sperm is on the head, I am now the Pope, the gods in the world, and the incarnation. Although not very professional, but must I want to do things and decisions related to my identity. Women can have them at any time, but now, as a pope, I can't resist this situation. I am still a fart God's apostle."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Su Ge’s heart gradually subsided, easily, without any reluctant retraction: “You have to find a dress first, I still need some time.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feeling the departure of Su Ge’s hand, Vanas was somewhat lost, nodded respectfully, and jumped from the wings of the Pope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time the massive breath has been absorbed and gathered in the body of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas looked around after landing and ran out barefoot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Su Ge alone, he closed his eyes and focused all his attention on this new knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The official is the foundation, purifying the soul as the framework, taking the knowledge of death as the core, using the voice of the soul as the medium, taking the composition of the spiritual space as the carrier, and the soul The disillusionment is the means. Finally, the sound of the late bell is used as a ritual, huh, huh, it turns out that this is the case, and everything is smooth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clearly, suddenly realized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The late bell is the elegy of the soul, the ritual of death. Only the bell that rings at the funeral represents sacredness and purification. The real core is not just killing, but also burial. Give the soul salvation, give the ghosts comfort, give the undead a liberation, and give the filth to death. Killing is only a means, the real core is to let those fascinating souls Freedom, redemption, is to give the soul a funeral."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "killing and purifying its soul, burying and redeeming its self. Killing and burial are inseparable, just like that The night bell that can only be heard in the funeral, it is the sacredness and purification of the dead soul. The bell and the funeral singer, the executor in time, the host of the funeral, is also the mourner of the soul."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Su Ge's inner heart is completely accessible, all thinking, all logic is so clear and clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All thoughts, all the knowledge in Su Ge's thinking quickly condensed, like a mechanical number of parts, began to quickly arrange and assemble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A moment, everything is shaped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the night clock system, the second body of knowledge formed: the funeral system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "From the perspective of the characteristics of knowledge, the funeral system and the late clock system are completely different concepts. The main attack of the late bell is the means at the physical level, and The funeral system is mainly used in the spirit and the soul. Through many means and knowledge, the funeral is directly executed on the soul, thereby directly achieving the effect of eliminating and purifying the soul, and classifying it, it should be regarded as a system of spiritual illusion. After all, After this time has passed, I have no direct authority to die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the knowledge was formed, Su Ge gathered the remaining energy in his own evening clock. Morphologically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Through these energies, physically and mentally, it is possible to form the evening bell form into a regular form that can be used later. But... my body seems to Some can't stand it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no such store after this village, first condense and say."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Su Ge immediately mobilized all his authority, just like a hand-made producer, using the energy and breath of death as a material to consolidate this form, and to integrate the heart with the heart through the night clock. Turn it into a psionic armor that seems to be hidden in the body's soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as you don’t use it, you won’t have problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time does not know how long the past, when Su Ge returned to God, his body's authority to die has disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shape of the night bell is turned into psionic power, which is integrated into his body along the pores of his skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the form disappeared, Suger immediately heard a violent skeletal dislocation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
