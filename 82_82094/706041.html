			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hausman Manor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke, Stephen, two people standing in the door with a slight nervousness, looking at the outside, the world of light shining like a star-shaped light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, they know very well that these spots are not beautiful stars, but the lanterns of the clerics of the clergy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't expect to face such a battle so soon." Duke's face was pale and pale, with a little helplessness in his tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cass came out of the room at this time: "Repent?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke Silence Shaking his head for a second: "No, regretting in the merchant's guidelines is taboo, I am thinking about how to live safely."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cass laughs Laughter, reaching out and patting his shoulder and said: "Reassure, you won't have anything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking, the locked door has been invisible The power is open, a lot of expressions are solemn, and the clergyman holding the weapon is like a monster without emotions, coming in silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A burst of dignified, chilling atmosphere makes Duke two people can not help but accelerate the beat, the mental tension to the extreme. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Duke Hausman! The Church of the Holy Blood suspects that you collude, shelter the cult, violate the Empire Anti-Cult Act and the Church Commandments, my Holy Blood Church Salou The Archbishop is guilty of spreading cults and endangering national security. He is arrested for participating in cult actions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke heard this voice, Duke's face paler, but his expression But more calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stepped forward and responded: "Sorry, Archbishop Saru, I am unbelievers, the terms of the Church of the Holy Blood cannot bind me. At the same time, I have Baron, according to imperial law, without the permission of the royal family, the church is not qualified to arrest me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Handheld luxury golden sword, wearing a masked Saru low The voice said: "It seems that you have been completely polluted by the cult, and now the light of the goddess will purify everything!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, a golden light flashed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This moment, Duke has felt that he is dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He feels that he is very peaceful and has no fluctuations in his heart. Instead, he has a feeling of relief and liberation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the midst of it, he feels that a great existence is waving to himself, and if he gets there, he can enjoy the peace of the eternal world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when he returned to God, he found himself still standing here, the environment around him was still there, and the dangerous and dangerous golden light did not kill himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked around and he found a person at a distance of about one meter from himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This person is wearing a black line, a white shirt, and a very rare sleeveless trench coat outside the clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this scene, Duke’s heart was relieved to come first, and almost sat on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that the Lord has not abandoned him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke is not the person who knows it, but he can feel the power of this person, or it is strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because this person, the whole body exudes a strange black mist, seems to be between the real and the nothing, looks really illusory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Saru standing opposite is completely gloomy at this time: "A group of worms hiding in the dark corners, dare to come to the sacred land of the church?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person who dresses the evening bell to teach the clothes hears a hoarse, low-pitched laugh, which sounds like it has been alive for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s been a long time to go out and stroll, just as my grandson told a very interesting thing, so come over and see." The black mist dissipated slightly, revealing a handsome look that looked only 17 or eight years old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a handsome young man who looks like 18 years old. His handsome appearance makes Kos feel ashamed and makes people feel handsome. It is no longer human. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, he is not human in nature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hal Hearst!" After seeing this beautiful face, a master bishop beside Saru was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hal Hearst, the legendary vampire in the night, I heard that it has not come out since entering the bloody holy pool thousands of years ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real time of life, I don’t know how many years have passed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Randall Hearst, who has lived for more than 500 years, is his immediate grandson. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is worth noting that Randall has no father, mother, or even grandmother, only this grandfather. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has a lot to do with the vampires that are not known to others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke and Kas do not know who this Hal Hearst is, but from the reaction of the church, two people know this The position is not ordinary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hal opened the blood-like scarlet lips, revealing sharp fangs, but the young British drama is full of years of baptism and vicissitudes. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? I have been sleeping for hundreds of years and there are people who know me? Is this my honor, or is it unfortunate?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one of the three ancestors of the Hearst family, one of the five actual masters of the night scene, Hal’s prestige was widely circulated around the world long time ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the record of the church, about a thousand years ago, when he entered the bloody holy pool, the rank was the lord. Now a thousand years have passed, no one Know what extent he has arrived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't expect you to be confused by those innocent guys. It's ridiculous." Saru said with a smirk on his face, disdainfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black fog gradually dissipated, and Hal only had a body about one meter seven or five and fell to the ground. He looked down at his own line and said freely: "I am very satisfied with this dress, regardless of the design and style, which is suitable for our vampires to wear, especially this rare high dome hat."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said, he reached out with a black gloved hand and pointed at the hat on his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he then answered Salou’s sneer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""I don't confuse myself, I know very well." Then, Halna's relaxed appearance gradually disappeared and turned into a cold and lonely look: "Since the true God Right there, why should I make a conflict?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing at the doorstep Su Ge looked at the doorstep of Father Sini, and the face without a mask showed a peaceful smile: "You have recovered well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French priest Sini Although the body looks old, it is still refreshing, as if it were not injured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French Sini did not hold the sword. He looked up at Su Ge at the time with a pipe, and some shouted: "I just saw the moment, I thought You have recovered."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge shook his head: "There is no reason to come back after returning. I just want to take my own path, one only. It belongs to the human path."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French Sini is silent: "Why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Because only in this way can I achieve the direction I want." Su Ge answered the question seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French Sini put down the pipe and asked questions seriously: "So, what direction do you want to go?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s deep eyes look at the night: “I want to subvert this sky, I want to reshape this land, I want people to feel warm at sunset, I want people to feel at sunrise Hope. I want all human beings to get rid of the domination of fear and welcome the world that belongs to them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is impossible!" Father Sini, who knows the truth, immediately Lost voice denied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug regained his gaze and looked at his old face and said, "Because of this, I have embarked on this path."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you...become a saint?" Father Sini slowly raised his hand and held the hilt behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sage, no saint, neither for the church nor for the world, is a good sign. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge grinned: "There are enough saints around me, and I am not interested in saints."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Speaking, Su Ge’s eyes are full of expectations: “I just want to accomplish this with human identity, human mentality, and human will.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French Sini looked at Su Ge’s eyes, and at this time he found that the eyes were like the legendary stars shining with the radiance that he could not look directly at. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This light is full of hope, full of peace, full of kindness, full of peace. At this moment, he even felt in these eyes, the beautiful world in Su Ge's mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, he returned to God and heard the voice of Archbishop Laurie: "After the question is over, you can retreat. Anything that happens here. Everything has nothing to do with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the coming of the voice, Laurie took the lead in the darkness and there were hundreds of clergy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the lord's Laurie, there are two other archbishop-level archbishops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of people couldn’t get through the entire house, everyone with a weird white mask, a lantern around their waist, and a night watchman The thorny iron bar in the hand is filled with a dignified atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laury looked at Su Ge’s costume, and asked coldly, “Where is this, where are you going?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Suge's faint response: "Go to a show."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? What kind of play can be worthy of your solemnity?" Laurie asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge regained his gaze and looked at Laurie: "\b Witness the destruction of a world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;Laurie was stared at by this abyss, and suddenly he was somewhat cautious. Then he thought of his current means. His inner uneasiness gradually calmed down: "Unfortunately, you can't witness anything, not just you, your men, new. The believer is now dead under the goddess of the goddess."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s mouth reveals a smile: "You mean Kas and Duke Hausman "?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Laurie said: "Of course."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh..." I laughed softly and looked around and asked: "With these few people, I want to hurt the believers of the hunter. Are you too self-sufficient?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, and there was a fierce mysterious wave in the southwest direction of these people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lauri suddenly turned his head, and countless darkness fluttered like a tentacle in the night, seemingly receiving messages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, he felt a strong breath that he had never felt in the air, this mysterious wave, its violent degree, made him feel Trembling inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under waiting for him to return to God, Su Ge continued: "Vampires are poor people who have been judged as heretics for many years. You are completely blind to your eyes." What is the real rule, what is the true truth. So when the power of my Lord is spread to the night, many lost lambs are looking for and become the people of my Lord."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lauri suddenly turned his head: "You actually got the filthy family!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Their filth, Compared with your physical filth, it is not worth mentioning. The Hearst family is only a poor person who has been persecuted by you after being tempted by you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Speaking, Su Ge has a strong irony in his eyes: "And among them, Hal Hearst should be the most "emotional" to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard the name, Laurie’s face suddenly changed. He read the history books and knew the fear of the name. It was also very clear. Why should a monster hiding in the blood pool is not out of St. Margaret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You crazy! You dare to let this monster come out, people all over the world will spit you!" Laurie snorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugghe smiled: "I just give the poor people redemption. In the future, people who have been spurned all over the world have someone else, maybe one. Maybe ten, maybe hundreds, maybe a name, or a church. In short, it won't be me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Hal Hurst, about a year ago, when Sug and Sherry passed through the night scene, they were seen through Randall’s referral. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At that time, Hal had completely fallen into the thirst for blood and could not extricate himself. He could only stay in the bloody holy pool every day to stay awake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And turning him into this way is naturally the Church of the Holy Blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to kill him, the Church of the Holy Blood used his trust in a church member to let him drink blood alcohol with severe toxicity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No toxicity can kill ghouls, and even a lot of venom that destroys body tissues will be instantly repaired by ghouls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this poison is not a conventional toxin, but a mysterious drug. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its effect is very simple, greatly stimulating Hal's desire for blood, while suppressing his rationality, similar to a certain psychotropic drug. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This drug has been specially treated by the Church of the Holy Blood, like a skeleton of the bones deep into his bone marrow, completely unable to clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last helpless haar escaped into the bloody holy pool, through the steady flow of blood in the holy pool to maintain reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Suge passed by, Hills, who was listening to the night, said that Su Ge had seen this legend through Randall. A powerful vampire at the ancestor level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg was also surprised when he saw the vampire, and after a five-hour conversation, Su Ge allowed him to do so. He pulled him into a dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
