			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, you need a good rest, so if you go on, you will be tired of the country." The palace in the capital of the capital of the Principality of Guinness A woman in her forties who wore a black and white maid was worried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of her large desk, Vanas, wearing a noble black tunic and lace long skirt, held her forehead and stamped a document. Later, he said: "Give this permission order to the Becky soldier, and let him immediately go to the arsenal to call enough gunpowder to support the defense of the front line."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maid Long took the file: "I am going to send people now, you need to rest now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now Vanas’s face is very bad, because she has not slept for a long time. Well, there are deep dark circles, and the irregular diet leads to a thin and pale face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original beautiful and noble queen, at this time gives a feeling of ghast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas slowly stood up and moved his body, lifted the skirt and walked out of the desk full of documents, turned his head and looked at the time and found that it was already late at night. The clock is gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, it's time to rest." Vanas nodded slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maid was very happy, and after letting the confidant send the documents out, he immediately took Vanas to the temporary bedroom next door to prepare for a break. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You need to take a medicated bath to relieve fatigue." First help Vanas to take the pure gold crown inlaid with gems, the maid said intimately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Standing in front of the mirror, looking at himself like a female ghost, Vanas slowly squeezed the hand under the sleeve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few months ago, she was recognized as the flower of the north in many kingdoms in the north, the pearl of Guinness, the prince of countless duchys, and even the empire of the great empire Object. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s no exaggeration to say that those who pursued her at that time could discharge hundreds of meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, a few months of suffering has made her unrecognizable, only to see some of the shadows of the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you agree with the advice of Prince Sacco, you don't have to be so tired." The maid said distressedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas listened to the bloody eyes with a hint of reluctance: "If he is a simple marriage, it is not a problem for me to marry him. But he wants It is absolutely impossible for our country to become a dependent country of their country! I have my own insistence, and..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said, the face of Vanas There is a hope that is completely inconsistent with her current situation: "I have found our way to redemption."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maidservant can’t bear to see, from After a weird dream six days ago, the spirit of Her Majesty's Majesty became somewhat abnormal. She often couldn't help but smile, and said some words that others could not understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She knows that the Queen may have collapsed because of too much pressure, and that behavior is a form of venting stress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the overlook of the maid's maid, Vanas stepped into the bath and felt the warm water of the pool to nourish his body. Vanas said that he did not say It’s comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the steam of the cockroach, she closed her eyes and fell asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Great Master, when are you calling your servant again?" In the subconscious, Vanas pleaded for hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past few days, she has been busy for two hours each day for the most pious prayer and to contribute her faith and thoughts to her own Lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two hours is not too long for other believers, but for her, she sleeps only two hours a day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as she begged, she suddenly felt a gray mist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a female knight riding a giant ghost wolf with a long sword and a waist-chain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This attire is familiar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Vanas Guinness, your devout faith has won the joy of my Lord, and now I am grateful, honored, sincere, and admired with me. Enter the kingdom of my country."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment of hearing this sentence, Vanas opened his eyes and his face was filled with happiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She feels like a desperate person seeing the door to heaven open for himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the scorpion who has been bullied has suddenly got the emperor’s privilege, and his heart is full of joy, excitement, gratitude... The haze of a few months has been swept away. For a moment she seems to have returned to the noble years that have been held in the palm of her hand by countless people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you! Thanks to the supreme master for giving this opportunity to the humble servant." Vanas, who was picked up by the female knight with one hand, folded her hands together and was filled with worship. And the piety of the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the fog of layers, Vanas once again came to the world of dreams in a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this time she found herself not in the last battleship, but in a world full of fog and tombstones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes looked around carefully. In the fog, she saw the huge ghost wolf walking and walking, and saw countless ice blue ghosts wandering around, watching Arrived in a neat array of patrol guards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the whole world gives a feeling of incomparable ecstasy, but more of it is a solemn and sacred feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Lord of Death and Storm, the only true God of the Valley and the Abyss, it is normal to have such a Kingdom of God, I can't make a fuss."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind the horsewoman, Vanas kept telling himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the female knight in front said coldly: "You are not qualified to see my master now. If it was not the mercy of my Lord, you are already dead. I don't know how many times."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for the kindness and magnanimity of the Lord." Vanas said with great enthusiasm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This thing she experienced personally, if not the Lord’s stop, those spears will definitely stab themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horsewoman continued: "The original piety is not enough to impress my Lord to let you come to the Kingdom of God, but my Lord will not give up any one of His people. This time, it is a slap in the face of you. You have to be worried. Grateful, know? mortal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes! I understand! Please rest assured, I swear by my ancestors, the Guinness family from now on, from generation to generation Serving the Lord of Death and Storm, the only true God of the Valley and the Abyss, eternal life regards it as the only faith."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight listened with satisfaction and nodded: "Go Well, the apostle is waiting for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Apostle Adult?" Vanas was surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Horsewoman explained: "The apostle is the one who lives in the world instead of my Lord. It is the pope and founder of the Church of My Lord. You really thought Does your own need to deal with this matter?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas shook his body and shook his head: "Don't dare! The servant dare not!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Very satisfied with Vanas' performance, the female knight is not speaking and continues to lead the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After about ten minutes, two people stopped outside the magnificent temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight came forward respectfully and said: "The apostle, Vanas Guinness is here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas hurriedly followed: "My humble servant, I have seen the apostles."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get up, you and me are my masters The people, don't have to be too far." Soft, nice, with a warm and kind voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sound immediately calmed Vanas’s trembling heart and thought: “Listen to the sound, this must be a mature and stable wise man.”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking, she looked up and then stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug, wearing a luxurious black Phnom Penh robe, asked: "What's wrong? The Lord's child?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
