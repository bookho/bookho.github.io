			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sitting on the carriage, Su Ge looked through the window to see the street scene, and experienced three worlds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The area of ​​the studio is very large, divided into outer city, central area, inner area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outer city is a civilian city near the side of the city wall. The whole part can be said to be riddled with holes. There are traces of war everywhere, and the air is filled with smoke. Bullet holes and bullet marks are visible everywhere on the walls and on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scene reminds Su Ge of the Middle East scene seen on television during the Earth era. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are full-armed people everywhere, people are nervous, and the children use the shells and bomb fragments as toys to shuttle through the ruins...<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going along the main road, passing a 20-meter-long stone arch bridge, after crossing the ring road, Su Ge felt himself coming to a new world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This area is relatively calm, with neat red brick buildings on both sides, clean streets, lots of pedestrians, and they are neatly dressed, some workers in gray overalls, There are businessmen in black suits and vendors who sell newspapers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feeling here is just completely different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it was just a war-torn region in the Middle East, then it became a prosperous second-tier city similar to Bain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a lot more orderly than the outside chaos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But one thing that surprised Su Ge was that there was only one river, but there was no refugee who fled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The side of Elena explained: "There are concentrated refugee camps in the outer city, where they are directly under the jurisdiction of the Queen and have military protection. The conditions for living there must be It’s a lot better than coming here. After coming in, it’s not only suffering from white eyes and disgust, but also the pressure is very big. After all, the level of consumption is different. It’s easier outside. According to the Queen’s new policy, those people can become temporary militia, protect the family while enjoying the soldiers. The treatment, although the salary is not high, but can guarantee that the family is full and warm."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon hearing this Su Ge, my heart suddenly got a deeper understanding of Vanas’s rule. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distribution of the entire homing city is ring-shaped, and it is very neat from the map. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two main roads are divided into four equal parts in a cross shape. The buildings, shopping malls and other buildings are generally equilateral triangles, which looks very Comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge put down the map and said: "The person who designed this capital must be an obsessive-compulsive disorder patient."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Irene grabbed the map and shouted: "The original design of this capital city, but a master architect, he is still a powerful mystery, he passed a special The mysterious method of arranging the city into this way, said that the royal air can be guaranteed, and the kingdom of Guinness will continue."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The kingship is not eternal, my child Hearing this, Su Ge instinctively said this classic line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is your child!" Elena’s eyes glimpsed like a fierce little tiger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cough! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg coughed and turned to look at the street and found that the scenes around him changed again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment they passed a relatively low wall and came to the inner zone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scenery in the inner area is completely different from the outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road here is wide and the street lights are neat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are not houses on either side of the road, but tall walls with different shapes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the wall, you can barely see the towering spires of the houses behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just passing through a steel gate that looked at least ten meters wide, looking through the gap, Su Ge saw the neat courtyard behind, plus wrong The stone path, the green plants, the square and the fountain, and finally the tall castle made up of dark red, gray blue and white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the gate, four fully armed soldiers can be seen. From the silver-gray armor and the hand-held gear guns, these guards are armed far above the regular army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The armed forces of these nobles seem to be much better than your army." Su Ge turned and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illina nodded generously and said: "That is for sure, the nobles are very rich, and there is no problem in feeding a small elite army." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Suger heard a round of melodious music and faint talk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turning to look at the north side of the road, just to see a lot of luxury carriages parked on the side of the road, many young prostitutes wearing glamorous dresses are attending Under the guidance of the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the Marquis of Raul, today is the birthday party of the old Marquis son." Elena said casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s eyes looked at the door, just to see a petite woman wearing a white dress with a silk hat and black lace gloves. I walked down the gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This woman came to me and suddenly became the focus of everyone. All the men’s eyes were attracted to her, with deep admiration and deep hiding. desire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is the only daughter of the Duke of the Mountain, called Selcy. In the past few years, the city has been famous for its social flowers. It is rumored that countless men have dumped it." Although Na is disdainful on her face, her eyes and tone reveal an envy and sour taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, all women love beauty and are eager to be the focus and admiration of all men at the ball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug turned to look at her and said with a smile: "You dress a little more than you are."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illina listened to some embarrassed bows and fiddled with the corner of the leather armor and said, "You don't have to flatter me. I still have self-knowledge."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge shook his head and said, "This is not flattering, it is the truth. You see that she smeared like that, but it is a little better than you. When you take off your leather." With a light makeup, high heels and evening gowns, you will definitely blast her a few streets, believe me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
