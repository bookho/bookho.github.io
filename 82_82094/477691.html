			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After things are done, Sug commands the knights to the dreams of all believers, to inform the situation and to pay attention to the way they talk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thousands of knights have soared and entered the dream to find their own goals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost all of the churches in the church today are Guinness's werewolves, and are mostly aristocrats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All residents of Guinness are werewolves, but there are about 500 people who know and join the church in the late bell. These people are generally aristocrats in the capital and middle-level Elites, the hands of these 500 people control 70% of the entire city's income, and 60% of the country's total income. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are about 100 old aristocrats and new aristocrats in the absolute center of Vanas, the core of these five hundred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one of the reasons why Soge dared to let go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past few months, Vanas has been directly governed as a deputy pope, and the loyalty of the entire church is very good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although they are more awe-inspiring and worshiping Su Ge, but Su Ge has less talk, so Vanas has a very strong mass base. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he appointed Vanas as the deputy pope, he secretly prepared for this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cavaliers took two messages in the past, the first one is about the investigation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other is to unite into the dream tomorrow night, follow the Cavaliers into the Kingdom of God, the great Lord has major things to announce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those of the powerful knights, no one has paid attention to it or violated it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are very aware of the Lord’s divine power and are more clearly guilty of the violation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, the quiet returning city was revived from the night as usual, people washing, eating, morning exercise, starting a new day of life and work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deserted streets become more and more noisy as the sun rises and the sun shines through the gap between the houses and the leaves in the city. The wild cats lying on the walls stretch comfortably and comfortably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg’s return did not cause any waves, and people are still as they have been in the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After breakfast in the morning, Su Ge started his quiet day with his second husband. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking a dog, reading a book, dealing with official duties, running, eating, looks like an ordinary staff member. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the high-end hotel in the center of the city, the dark star brows tightly: "Adult, is Vanas telling him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Laurie did not speak and continued to close his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At two o'clock in the afternoon, the magical array formed by the black agate in the room heard the sound of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, are there any problems in these days?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, started yesterday There are so many mysteries in the city, I don't want them to be in the city, and the people who bring you will deal with them as soon as possible." Vanas's calm voice came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge responded: "No problem, some bugs, and it will be solved quickly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Hearing this, the two men looked at each other and had a bit more trust in Vanas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Adult, what should we do next?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait." Laurie leaned comfortably on the couch and enjoyed the autumn sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no major incident during the day, and the various strengths gathered here are hiding themselves, converging their own form and fangs, watching The situation in the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! Boom! ......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At noon, there was a thick bell in the Basilica of the Holy Blood, which quickly radiated out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Su Ge, who was standing in the ground floor of the clock tower, closed his eyes, and forty-three gray spots appeared in his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The forty-three light spots represent the mysterious person who enters the city from the outside and has a mysterious body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It looks pretty honest, if you don't want to die, give me honestly!" Su Ge said coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time went into the evening very quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a special scene in the movie city today. It’s a bit deserted in the night, especially in some high-end hotels and clubs, there are few people visiting. It seems to be a ghost town where no one lives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The main elite, and the aristocrats of all sizes did not come out today. Did they hear any winds?" In the dark, one hid in the night The mystery in the middle of the hotel looked at the doubts in the distant hotel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one knows what happened today, and those who can’t catch the mind are more imaginative. These people are hiding at home at this moment. Wash and sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly changed from a night owl to a good citizen of work and rest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kingdom of God, in the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerlos, Adeline respectfully withdraws from the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The couple have just accepted the gift of the Lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss accepted the war of apocalypse and inherited the power of safari. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can see that Gerlos is wearing a close-fitting silver-gray armor, with his eyes shining with the cold ghost, behind his back with a crystal frosty sword. The whole body exudes a horrible chill, like a white frost lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The side of Adeline turned into a blue ghost form, entered a new form, holding a hand like a staff The frosty long scorpion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two men clenched each other's hands and looked at each other's eyes and looked at each other's satisfaction and happiness. They looked up and said: "This is just a dream."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the ghost knights continually descended from the sky, a group of people stepped into the long-lost kingdom of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, it can be said that it is the largest gathering of believers since the founding of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at it, the number has reached more than 500 people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people are generally dressed in aristocrats and elites, and they talk elegantly. The vast majority of them are Guinness's werewolves, and a small number are immigrants who settled in from Bain City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are the most devout believers, absolute obedience to the Lord's Divine Power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before these congregations, the core combat power of the late bell church is all in place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas, Father Water, Master Gerald, Master Mill, Ms. Adeline, Randall, Hills, Bernice, Eli Na, Jean, the ten madmen who were rescued from the church dungeon by the deputy bishops of the church, Jenny, Nishizawa, Alger, and Nicole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people are solemn and solemn. In front of them is a deep and sacred dark temple with a tall, burly knight on each side of the gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the ceremonial guards standing there and motionless, forming a broad and solemn road to the king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At half past eight, after everyone came together, Su Ge stood in front of the front and looked forward, satisfied with his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a total of 536 people present, the arrangement is very neat, the distance between them is the same as the amount of standing, standing standard, meticulous, expression Supreme, devotional, like a statue of the ancient statue, it makes people fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unconsciously, our church has grown so much that it has become a few hundred people." Su Ge was full of anger and shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“As the number of people increased, we also entered a critical period of development. So I made a proposal to the Lord, the proposed content is about the framework of our entire church, and the distribution of functions.”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now we are not like our first time, a dozen people, but become a huge organization. I hope that while you get the main asylum, you should The hard work is strong, and the glory of my master is spread farther away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My Lord is fascinating, glorious!" At this time, these more than 500 people screamed in unison. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This snoring, rising from the sky, resounded throughout the Kingdom of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is very satisfied and continues to sing: "The power of my Lord is endless, my Lord is kind, my Lord is generous. Today, there will be Some people get the gift of my power!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, everyone can't help but listen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge Chang Shu breathed and continued: "The devout devotees of our family are very satisfied, so my Lord decided to come down personally."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;! ! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, everyone can't help but open their eyes, and the breath is a little short. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But all of you know that the four principles of the gods are not qualified to listen to the true voice of my Lord at our level. Therefore, my master shows His infinite power and wisdom, injecting a force into my body, using my body as a medium to complete a small part of the gods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp At the same time that everyone envied, they began to get excited, but regardless of the slightest change and whisper, they could only open their eyes and watch the dark temple quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge turned and walked into the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people looked at the door of the temple incessantly, constantly swallowing, and the heart that accelerated the jump jumped out of the chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The god of the gods! Even the body that comes through the human body has an indescribable power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know how long it has been, and the dark door that has only slightly opened a little is suddenly completely open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, the indescribable pressure from the temple flooded the entire Kingdom of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, everyone present is feeling the horror of the four words of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pump! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In almost an instant, everyone is incomparably squatting on the ground, and yelling at the same voice: "Congratulations to my Lord God!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪嗒! Hey! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steel boots stepped on the obsidian, and the crisp sound gradually came, and everyone squatted on the ground, no one dared to look up, at this moment, everyone Holding your breath, no one dares to breathe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get up! My people." At this time thick, majestic, distant voice seems to come from the sky, seems to pass in everyone's ear Come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This voice is very casual, and the tone is very light, just like talking casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, in this case, no matter where you can listen, you can hear clearly, and listen to people with fear and worship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As in the previous Vanas, no one can resist this order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the voice says to let them die, then they will not hesitate to commit suicide at this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The command of the gods, even if it is an incomplete form of attachment, is beyond doubt and cannot be resisted! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He raised his head." The voice came again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people heard the rise, and when the eyes saw the majestic body, they could no longer look away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, everything between heaven and earth has lost its color and meaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
