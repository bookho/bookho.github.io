			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Suge woke up, he felt a little heavy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also feel that something seems to be licking my face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fuzzlingly open your eyes, Su Ge just saw the second haha ​​no heart and lungs on himself, sticking out his long tongue and washing himself ". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge opened the second haha ​​and smiled: "Get up, you, this siberian pig can't breathe me."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two ha stunned Sug’s head and stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge sat up and found himself in a certain ruin in the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The positioning is not very accurate!" Su Ge spit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the warship left, Erha became a cold ice to protect his body from the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal of the plan is to be close to the edge of the event, but the current position seems to be a bit far. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pick up the cane and look at the broken wall around him. Su Ge sighed helplessly: "The whole city was destroyed by almost a third. The city’s inhabitants have died at least one-tenth. This is a good job, and the church is busy enough.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The Pope’s Majesty!” In the distance, came the Greek The voice of les. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug turned and looked at it, just to see Hille with Adeline, Luke and others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are Rogan, Marx three night patrols. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing no outsiders, Su Ge sighed and took a quick walk with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two sides will be together, Marx sighed: "Scared me, I thought you were really killed by Ron."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benedicts on the side said: "How is it possible that the methods of our Pope are far beyond your imagination."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luke carefully looked at Su Ge at this time and sighed: "Thank you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bobby hurriedly asked: "Where have you been for so long? You are wrong with a good show!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogen took her head and blamed: "What is missing, the Lord of Death and Storm is Su Summoned out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What!?" Some of the slow Bobby and Marx look shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This article does not deny that he said: "Otherwise, do you think? The Pope in the mouth of Hills and Bernice is white. What? Our late bell church is relatively small, but it will not go to that point."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people suddenly feel awkward, embarrassed Shaved his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luke said with a smile: "Do not worry, then it is not this believer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, everyone said aside the situation in the Church of the Holy Blood. Su Ge touched the heads of Hills and Bernice and said with satisfaction: "It’s beautiful, it’s the acceptance of my Lord. The gift of the foggy warrior!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two big girls who were touched by Su Ge were very happy and squinted and enjoyed their faces. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside Marx looked at the two wicked and wicked witches, the murderous and unobtrusive witches were like two kittens in front of Su Ge, and they were secretly surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simply verify the situation at the time, and several people will separately address the issues that need to be resolved now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is Adeline: "There are 32 people who want to join the Church of the Night, but most of them are ordinary people. Can we accept it?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next is Rogan: "Your existence does not want the Holy Blood Church to know, if you know what you are going to do, if you don't know, then you should deal with it as soon as possible. Look at the civilians and clergy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Luke, he whispered: "After the baptism of the gospel bell, the church's ten crazy priesthoods The people, the minds have returned to normal, they are eager to enter your majesty, but because they are the culprits or important figures of the Church of the Holy Blood, if you want to receive, you must deal with other people."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Hills said: "Ron's remaining embers have been caught, what should I do next?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of this series of questions, Su Ge did not have any claws and calmly studied these four questions carefully. Then he discovered that three of the four questions needed to deal with the witnesses in the Library of the Holy Bible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think of it, think quickly about the pros and cons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The structure of the church is now blank, and it is easy to accept that those general communicators are prone to problems. In our current situation, it can only be said to be a small organization. It is not a church. It is easy for us to accept the words of those believers. It is difficult for us to protect ourselves. After all, most of the churches are heretics."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, ordinary people believe temporarily I can't accept it. But for the time being, I can't mean that I can't say it in the future. I can't say it to death first. After leaving a certain amount of room, I will oppress them through the true existence of faith and keep it secret. I can't tell anyone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, this is what ordinary people do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As for the clergy and church personnel, experienced such a They estimate that they will have a great shake in their beliefs. There should be many people who are separated from their own beliefs and may join the church. The policy of ordinary church personnel is the same as ordinary people. What I need to build now is a secret. Small and fine organization. After the organizational structure is stable, it is developing downwards. At that time, it is even possible to form a high-ranking control mechanism for the present people, so that the heresy can be completely isolated from the ordinary people." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As for the clergy, if they are willing to join, then a warm welcome. If you don't want to, then move the great god out, I don't believe it. The gods who have just performed miracles are still unable to shake you this group of mortals!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Suge pats the body and wears a new mask On the face said: "Go, talk to them in the past."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone knows that Su Ge wants to hide his identity, so he didn’t say much, one line The man quickly returned to the incident and met with the people who were waiting anxiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
