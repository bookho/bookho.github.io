			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When on the way back to the carriage, passing through the intersection of Yujin Street and Xiangguo Street, the contemplative Su Ge suddenly felt a sharp mysterious wave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What?" With the sanctuary of the sacred mark, Su Ge is now very sensitive to this psionic fluctuation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Parking!" Su Ge said, and turned around with two haha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How? Bishop?" asked the groom who was carrying the cigar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge stares at a hidden corner: "You go back, I have something."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Looking at the serious face of the bishop, the groom knew that there must be something, so he left without saying anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weng! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the mysterious wave came again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This mysterious wave is very subtle, and even somewhat powerless, giving a feeling of no vitality and vitality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Su Ge felt a kind of indescribable weight and heat in this kind of fluctuation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's a bit interesting, it seems that the blood sacrifices really attract a lot of people." Su Ge thought, quickly approaching the corner of the alley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small and silent, Su Ge smelled a scorching smell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking sideways, Sug saw two completely burnt bodies, and stood next to the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This person is wearing some shabby cloth, nothing is taken, a long blond hair is draped behind, if not that body is too strong, Su Ge will Thought this is a woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time the man’s body is emitting a little black smoke and a red flame, as if the body is on fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just after the end of the battle, the black smoke and the flames gradually dissipated at this time, as if the flames were extinguished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all went out, the man spit out a black smoke and muttered to himself: "It’s so annoying, why should murder still come to this place?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that someone is talking to him. After waiting a few seconds, this person said: "So I like to fly in the sky, not want to go on the ground, these people are really Annoying."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few seconds later said: "Don't always say me, you are no better than me."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this neuropathy, Su Ge was more curious in his heart, just as he planned to continue to observe, the man suddenly turned his head, a pair of gray-black eyes staring at himself : "How? You are also coming to kill me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This person looks very handsome, thick eyebrows, hard-faced national face, fair skin, like a hole A powerful general. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people are opposite each other, and Su Ge sees the gray eyes suddenly burning two raging flames. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you also killing me?" The young man squinted and asked again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled and asked: "Do you see me like it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You look at it Su Ge's costumes and momentum, the flames of the eyes went out, and the whole person immediately turned from a powerful handsome general who had just been a good person to a home that seemed to have just woken up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strong body is loose, and the eyelids are waxing down: "If not, just want to find a place to hold a bucket of wine and have a good night's sleep." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger's arms bent with a cane and his hands clasped his chest and asked: "Want to drink? I know a good drive, the wine there is very good." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear this, the young man provokes his eyelids: "Do you need me to spend money?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I am all inclusive, just drink." Su Ge said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man immediately grinned: "All the friends who can ask me to drink are good friends. My name is Givens."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sug Sotos." Su Ge I don't want to hide it, just say it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The youth listened to the name and suddenly slammed his head: "Don’t be noisy, I know!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes carefully looked at Su Ge and grinned: "You have a good surname."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge has a deep answer: "You Have a good partner."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snow grass pub, is the whole shell The famous high-end tavern in Encheng, the signature of which is the use of the ice spring water of the snow mountain, with the special grain and the snow wine mixed with the snow grass juice, a sip of the stomach, first transparent and refreshing, while the wild fire upper body Finally, the blood is boiling and the body is comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the price is naturally high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One pound of wine, 60 francs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah! Shuang! It’s so cool! This is the best wine I have ever had in my life!" Drinking a full half a catty, Gwens face slightly Red, the spirit of shouting loudly, just that lazy sleep has long been thrown into the clouds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s little drink, a look of enjoyment, squinting, as if a child with candy, a happy face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. is not a local?" After a few seconds, Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gwens nodded slightly: "Well, I am a northerner."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How much North?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gwens looked up and said: "It’s very north and north."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gwens sighed and poured himself a cup: "It's a good wine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge did not continue to drink, watching Gwens ask: "This time, come to have fun?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gwens picked up a cup and asked "How do you know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It will become boring if you live too long. It happens that I know two people who have lived for a long time, sometimes they really It's very empty, especially the one who can't die if he wants to die." Su Ge said with a glass of wine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gwens took another sigh, with a sigh in his tone: "It’s not boring, I am more open-minded, mainly afraid of trouble. Feeling When it’s boring, it’s very rare to move around, just find a place to sleep. It’s good to drink and drink, sleep and wake up naturally. This is the most important thing in my life.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So every time I wake up, I feel that I am derailed from society, and it has caused a lot of trouble?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gwens Holding a bottle of wine, I feel helpless: "Well, this is very troublesome. It doesn't bother to sleep, and it is troublesome to sleep. So every few years, I feel inexplicably unhappy, so I want to come out and have fun."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge leaned on the chair: "Now it is different from before, the world is getting more and more sophisticated, and there are fewer and fewer places outside the law. People like you, It will be more and more difficult to have fun in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gwens smiled and didn't answer, and took another drink and sighed: "So it's getting bored, The more unhappy you are, the more you can rely on the wine to survive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge puts down the cup and leans forward: "The world has changed a lot, according to the truth. In fact, people like you should have a lot of things to do, not so boring?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The big things that can do things, I am a Hey, a waste, what can be done? Only the word "live"." Ge Wensi said, and made a big mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Su Ge did not continue to ask, two people quietly drinking, the atmosphere is a bit dignified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a moment, Gewens couldn’t help it: "If you run around with this surname, no one is asking you for trouble?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge spread his hand: "Maybe because I am handsome, humans really didn't bother me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who is looking for you trouble?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge raised his right finger and pointed at the sky: "Some annoying stars."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gwens Looked at the glove on Su Ge's hand and grinned: "It's beautiful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stop, he carefully looked at the Su at this time. Grid, eyes down Su Ge's arm and fell to the side of the cane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; suddenly he looked more eccentric, blinked his eyes and said: "Brother, I don't understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s face is full of innocent hands: “It’s clever, I don’t understand.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Is interested in developing in the north? We are old and fun.” Gewens made his own invitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge held his chin and closed his eyes for a moment: "I can consider it, but I have to deal with it now."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A group of small ants." Gewens immediately lost interest and squatted on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug is slightly close to whispering, "What about the Holy Grail?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gwens Eyes Slightly rising to look at Su Ge, grinning: "No interest, I am too lazy to play the lazy, it is still the best from this thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Su Ge did not speak, continue to drink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wine is a good thing. In a world without flames, you can only rely on these treasures if you want to live." Gwens seems to drink too much. I held a bottle of wine and sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is that wine good, or is it good?" Su Ge asked with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gwens heard this sitting up and meditated for a moment and answered seriously: "Well, it’s good wine. The fire has to burn something to continue. Wine doesn't need it, it will get longer and more fragrant, and it will turn into fire when necessary. How good! This is the greatest invention of all mankind!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;Su Ge took a sip, let's lick and grin, reminiscent of Yu Xiang: "Abyss under the illusion of dreams, what?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gwens brows a look, look After watching Su Ge, he said: "A group of ugly people, one is more ugly than one, and they don't know that they are scary."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is there?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am a waste, I don't know. You should ask the wolf for this kind of thing, you should not ask for waste."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Suge has a helpless spread of the spreader: "Unfortunately, I don't know the wolf, I only know this thing!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, touched Touch the two halves around you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gwenss body stood up slightly, leaned over and looked at the second haha, and the deep eyes flashed a sudden accident and shocked: "Kiru Yishra?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard the name, Sugton said: “What?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Gwenss has already sat back in his seat and blinked and said: "I am old, my eyes are not visible. I will let my friend help you after I have a chance."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge secretly remembered the name and smiled: "Come on! Continue!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people drank almost Two hours, walked out of the pub with each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have a place to live?" Su Ge asked dizzyly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gwens pointed to heaven: "Yes, the ground is not safe, I still live in the sky."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Also, live in heaven." Su Ge nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few well-dressed gentlemen heard the words of these two drunkards, they felt a bit inexplicable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stay in the sky? Who can live in the sky? moron! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
