			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain!" When the youth died, the rest of the people suddenly became very scared and shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The high priest! He is too powerful." One of the cultists shouted with a cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These believers are not the kind of mad believers, and even a few have not been taught for a long time, and there is nothing too strong faith. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Facing the terrorist power of Su Ge, I feel that my life has been threatened, and that their belief that they are not loyal has completely collapsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they hesitate...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗡嗡嗡! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A burst of harsh tweets suddenly came out of the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this voice, these cultists suddenly looked pale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are very clear about what this voice represents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the dividing line between life and death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;噗嗤! Hey! Hey! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the hammer slammed the human body into a muddy sound, and there were three more bodies on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a moment, all cultists were completely destroyed by Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug stood on the edge of the body and waved, the fog in the hall gradually dispersed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey? The fog seems to have dissipated!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People are gradually discovering this time . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The line of sight is gradually clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A person suddenly screams with excitement: "Look!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice immediately caught everyone's attention, and everyone looked in the direction of the man, just to see Su Ge standing next to the bodies of a group of cultists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My God, can he actually kill all these horrible cults?" When they saw this, people suddenly became shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as everyone was shocked, a steady voice sounded: "Are everyone okay?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp As the voice came, Macock walked over with a crew of guns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside them are Albert and Miss actor Mary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain!!" Seeing Macock, some of the people who knew him suddenly shed tears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the captain, I saw real hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he represents the strongest defensive power of the entire cruise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Macock said with apologetic sorrow: "I am sorry, our people have been kidnapped and threatened by cultists, but it is still in Drake. Mr. Dr. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Drake!?" The old man who had just been rescued hurriedly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Macock said: "Mr. Drake is fighting the monsters summoned by the cultists to protect your safety. Our goal now is to Kill all the cults on the ship."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Markock looked up and was held in the middle by a group of flesh-and-blood monsters. Channel: "Malkey, I really misread you, when did you join the cult!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marki did not answer, continue to bow down Some spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pico, who was hiding in the crowd, looked at Su Ge at this time and whispered, "This guy is too scary."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms. Iyeta faintly said: "This is nothing, his real horror is far beyond the limits of your imagination."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain, then this Who is a strong gentleman?" asked a middle-aged man with a singular character. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Macock said seriously: "He is a partner of Mr. Drake, and Mr. Drake is responsible for dealing with those monsters. This gentleman is responsible for handling the internal "Cult."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah! I know! I know!" said a certain lady. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At that time, this gentleman called Mr. Drake away and seemed to be discussing something." The lady said in a hurry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At that time, Mr. Drake knew the situation." Others suddenly became aware of this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Macock then came over with more than 30 soldiers armed with guns, faintly encircling Markey in the middle, and asked loudly: "If If you don't want to die, you will quickly get rid of it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, Marchi opened his eyes and a smirk on his face: "Dear stupid captain, you really think Have you already won the prize?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Macock whispered: "You have been surrounded by us. We are using a hunting bullet, which can be instantly You will reach a sieve."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Markihaha smiled: "Macock, I don't know if you are stupid or stupid. You really thought I was deliberate. Are the abilities leaked out false?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear this, Macock suddenly stunned and then his face changed: "Is it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Marchi turned to look at Su Ge and suddenly opened his arms: "If you can kill, you can kill everyone here." !? "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Scotland hands of the sword suddenly toss forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗖嗖嗖......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A series of swords broke out, and under the horror of everyone, they did not know what happened. The dozens of flesh-and-blood monsters in the middle of a dozen meters were suddenly crushed by a train. The flesh and blood, bones and organs of the whole body are broken and sprayed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this, everyone was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This... Is this the sword in those novels?" Many young people who have seen fantasy novels muttered at this time and were deeply The deep shock is coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although they don’t know what the principle is, they know very well that the reason why these flesh-and-blood monsters are blown out of the air is that the mysterious man has just waved the sword. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Too...strong! So handsome!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Face in such a bloody situation No one feels scared and does not feel sick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hundreds of people were all attracted to Su Ge’s sword and fell into admiration and awe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look at it! There are swords and swords in the air, it’s really a sword!" The sharp-eyed person saw the legacy of the air. Subtle traces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I also want to..." A large number of young people are completely obsessed, and they are completely attracted by Suge’s just a few swords and horrible attacks. , caught in it can not extricate themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Malki screamed in a loud voice, which made people feel extremely irritated and easily irritated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this voice, Su Ge immediately said loudly: "Throw out all the strong in your hand! Fast!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp At this time, these guards have been completely attracted by Su Ge’s sword. They have called Su Ge as an idol. They heard this order without any hesitation and directly threw their hands away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who just thrown out, just very noisy, suddenly fell into a strange death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Invisible, a burst of heavy gasping sounds constantly in the hall, like a group of hungry and furious beasts, ready to burst at any time, tearing everything in front of you Rotten, swallowed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
