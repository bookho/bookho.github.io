			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After two people slid around the park, Su Ge became more proficient in the body. Even the amount can be removed from the cane and walk like a normal person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can be said to be blessed in disguise. The effect of the lion's blood on the body's body is very obvious, even if there is only one drop, it can also make people's body get a lot of blessing. After all, the rumor is that the Griffin is a branch of the descendants of the dragon." Hank looked at Su Ge's flexible body and sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s body and his hands clenched his palm and said with a smile: “Thank you very much for Bishop Ron and Master Geros.”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"French Hank!" At this time, from the fork in the cathedral, he rushed over to a monk in a black robe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father Hank turned to ask: "What's wrong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A priest is in The gangster’s wrestling was injured, the artery was cut open, the internal organs were injured, and you need your help.” The monk gasped and said in a hurry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father Hank nodded quickly and turned and said, "Sorry, you can't continue to chat with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Suge said he didn't mind, asked: "Right, I haven't finished reading the book. Can I take it back and continue to watch it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Of course, that is for you." Father Hank said, turned and said to the monk: "I will return to the ward with the Sotos priest, and then lead him to leave."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, turn around and walk away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sotos, please!" The monk said very politely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Su Ge was led by the monk, his legs and feet were flexible back. In the ward, pack your own things, bring the "The Evening Bell of the Glen", follow the stone road of the fortune, pass through fifteen stone arches, cross four parks, and finally seven small churches. I came to the main entrance of the Basilica of the Holy Blood and saw the wide and lively square in front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, thanks to the monk's lead, Su Ge pulled his coat, pinched the book in his hand, and strode out the door with a cane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is there a feeling like a world?" Su Ge looked around, familiar and somewhat strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge did not stay here, but went straight to the home along Yujin Street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time Ada should not be at home, but he missed Lobo a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the snow-covered streets, home is still so familiar and warm, and nothing changed three days ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the living room, there is a simple coat made of worn coat and old cotton. At this time, Lobo is lying on top of it, his head is raised on the edge. On the corner, open your mouth and close your eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When someone came in, Erha suddenly opened his eyes, and a rollover jumped out of his small bed, and a pair of blue eyes with a god instantly locked in Standing on the door of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗷呜呜! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With an exclamation of excitement, the tail of Erha’s squatting suddenly rose up and stepped toward Suge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug is also happy to kneel down and open his arms and embrace this lively partner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ha! what! what! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening the mouth, while the second breathe, the tongue sticking out the pink tongue against Su Ge’s face is like a madness, just like that winter night. Just met in the wilderness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the feeling of being happy at the moment, I was thinking about the lonely expression of just two ha. Su Ge suddenly felt a little unwilling to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s really hard to keep you at home!" Sug touched his ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey? Can I take it to work with me? Although Erha is not suitable for police dogs, this guy is not an ordinary ordinary thing, at the key I should be able to give me a lot of help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Su Ge’s head suddenly became alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, there is a play. I have a connection with it, it won't run around and mess, and it seems to distinguish goodwill and malice, and can understand people. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Su Ge's eyes flashed: "The heart is not as good as action, today I will take you to the police station to try!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The management of the police station is not strict, very human, often contains small animals, and other police officers occasionally bring their pets to the atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the premise is that it will not disturb other people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Su Ge returned to the house, replaced his own clothes and put on another clean suit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wear another brand new robe, Sug took his cane and took him out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second is very happy that he can go out and stroll, and ran out in a hurry. When he stepped down, he almost slipped and rolled down the steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge thought about it when he locked the door, or picked up a pen and left a note, telling Ada to go out with him, preventing her from coming back. Worried early. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sahuan’s walking on the street, the expression of the magical character of the second Hana is extremely funny at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bypassed passerby when he saw such a big dog, the first feeling was not fear, but laughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because this dog looks like it is really stupid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug does not care, slow walking behind, a look of calm and cozy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Excuse me, sir, is this dog yours?" At this time, a well-dressed tuxedo, outside is a plush coat, holding A gold-plated sandalwood cane, asked by a young man about thirty-five years old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
