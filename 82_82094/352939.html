			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oliver took the man out of the banquet hall, and at the same time opened his book of the undead, whispered a few words, five translucent The humanoid ghost quickly spreads to fly in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the signature skill of the hunter: the soul makes the magic. These make the magic is made by the human soul, although there is no combat power, it is immune to most damage. And have an IQ of about a teenager." Julie immediately whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is really not very familiar with the ability of the soul hunters. At this moment, I saw two of the five souls flying over here, just to see they. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here!" The two souls now have a shrill scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems impossible to ambush." ​​Sug sighed and stood up, not ready to attack the two souls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since there is no fighting power, there is no need to waste too much combat resources on them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mask man at this moment with his hands in his big sleeves, his posture is very calm, watching the quickly approaching Oliver and others asked: "Oliver holding Some magic books, the book of the undead is a three-level secret treasure, the overall combat power I am not his opponent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Face the mask man who came up with this, Su Ge did not care to say: "Oliver is good to Randall. Should you have enough confidence in the two expert mysteries?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Masked man smiled and reached out and said, "This is of course."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a total of 16 people on the opposite side, five are dead, and now there are ten One. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a total of twelve mysterious people on the side of Su Ge, and all of them are masters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For this battle, Su Ge has won the game. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as that thing doesn't come, it won't be annihilated for five minutes!" Su Ge said, pinching the cane in his hand and taking a deep breath. Tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that you are planning to gossip about it today!" Oliver asked staring at the mask man and Julie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The masked male voice responded calmly: "When you deceive us, you should be able to think of this end!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shu and others here have nothing to say about them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Randall turned into a mist and plunged directly into Oliver. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oliver did not dare to care, after opening the psionic shield, he opened the book of the undead in his hand, a huge, awkward ghost shadow shrouded him. On the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghost then opened his mouth under his control, making a terrible scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This call is very harsh, and the inner voice is full of fear and confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this kind of spiritual attack, Su Ge was prepared. After a late night, Su Ge added a meditation to himself, just to see an expert. The swordsman came to himself with almost a blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge has had the means to deal with this attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the night bell to protect the first wave of attacks, the ripples around Su Ge suddenly split and turned into countless sharp edges. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The swordsman is very alert and the body recedes instantly. Although the skin is dripping with blood, but because of the subliminal protection, only the skin is cut, not hit. Injury<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While he was back, Su Ge raised his pistol and shot at the swordsman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of body-skinned swordsman is not very inspirational. He didn’t feel any problem with this firearm at the moment, propping up the psionic shield, violent Rushed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his opinion, he was so embarrassed that he was attacked by a professional-level little guy as an expert-level swordsman, which made him very Annoyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be careful!" Not far away, Oliver, who was shaking with Randall, saw the swordsman ready to fight against Suger's bullets and hurriedly reminded him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is already late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a gunshot, the expert-level swordsman, who is very confident about his body and swordsmanship, was stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the mask man reached out to the two expert mysteries, and then squeezed hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two bodies were first stiff, and then accompanied by a violent convulsion, fell to the ground, do not know whether it is dead or alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;July quickly stepped forward and grabbed the two masks and brought them on, while disposing of the two professional-level mysteries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be careful with the dead bomb!" Su Ge noticed that the mysterious man behind him suddenly took out the bright red animal heart and prepared to throw it over here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗖! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A black shadow flashed, the heads of these two mysteries are gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hills kept the heads of the two men on the sidelines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vignia and the two vampire servants did not start, but firmly guarded Vanas and the two brothers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two people of the Dragon Flame believers are very bachelor, killing two people casually, grabbing the mask, and then turning around without saying anything, a blink of an eye disappears In the night...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without three minutes, Oliver took only ten of the ten people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half of Oliver had a burst of illusion on his body, constantly using invisible claws to attack Randall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Randall doesn't seem to care about this attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The will of the undead!" Oliver saw this face sullen to the extreme. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This talent is a special gift of vampires, undead people and other long-lived species. Their long life span allows them to accumulate enough spirit, the will is very tenacious and stable, and can immune most of the mental attacks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug holds a long sword and says to the rest of the four pale mysterious people: "Okay, you can die!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment when Su Ge raised his sword, he suddenly felt a paralyzed body and could not move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horror turned around and saw that the mask man actually shot himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing!?" Su Ge asked calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mask male voice with a apology: "Sorry, I was forced."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge turned his head and looked at Julie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Julie looked up in the air and seemed to see something horrible. She was pale on the floor and couldn’t speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr! Be careful! That guy... come..." Randall’s body, which has been firmly suppressed by Oliver in the distance, seems to have been attacked by a strange attack. The chest is suddenly penetrated, and the body tissue exudes a smell of burnt smell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then his body seemed to be knocked out by the train, and with the sound of a broken bone flew out for more than 20 meters, falling heavily on the ground, losing consciousness. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "See my Lord!" At this moment, Oliver and others immediately kneel down and said with respectful face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s eyes continued to sweep, only to find that he could not see anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that the Yi people who have summoned them with high intelligence are not enough to see."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master!!" Two vampire servants saw the owner seriously injured at this moment, suddenly chaos, and rushed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge loudly: "Hills goes back and protects his majesty!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
