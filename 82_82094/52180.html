			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart seems to be a very rich businessman, he has issued a price of 1 gram per day asking Su Ge as his temporary translation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This price can be said to be very generous, because this salary is twice the salary of the Soviet detective now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And because of the daily cash settlement, this suddenly eased the extremely tense economic conditions in the Su Ge family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two walked side by side on the street, and Bart held a note in his hand and said, "I am a member of the Tuol Investment Company and I am dispatched to the headquarters. The business traveler here, do you know this address?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug took the note and looked at it and said, “This place I know, is the whole shell. The financial center of Enshi is on the edge of the Church of the Holy Blood."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart said: "Please let me go there first, there is and I am docked. You can rest assured that I just put a gift in the past and changed my clothes. You are still my guide and translator."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge naturally did not refuse The reason for saying: "Since we are here, we should change direction."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, and then turn the route to the direction of the city center. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the way, since Su Ge took the money, he couldn’t take it. He gave Mr. Barth a very enthusiastic introduction to Bain’s situation, customs, and related matters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart listened very seriously, and took out a small book with him to write down some key things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are still death sects here, it is really abhorrent!" Hearing that Suge mentioned the reasons for the strict investigation a few days ago, Bart was unhappy. Say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded and said, "The guys are so damn."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bad's hidden Looking at Su Ge's side face, he suddenly asked: "What other cult events have occurred besides the death sect?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge didn't think much. He thought about it: "There is nothing else. This is the second-tier city of the Empire. The security problem is still quite good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart listened Collapse this book and smiled and said: "If it is true, then it is best."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Su Ge’s heart is moving, he instincted in Bart Some unusual tastes were heard in the words and tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this guy also a mysterious person?" Su Ge’s heart twitched, and his palm slowly squeezed his cane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the main road, Pearl Street has been heading east. After crossing five streets, two people came to a huge square. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge circular plaza is paved with neatly flattened slate, quilted with advanced grouting technology to make the ground of this huge 300 square meter prototype square It looks like a whole, bright and beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The square is connected to the 12 streets of the city center, surrounded by neat benches, each with a towering black street lamp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a beautiful fountain in the middle of the middle. There are three beautiful and elegant white statues in the center of the fountain. That is the human form of the March goddess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The innermost side of the square near the east is a tall, solemn iron gate. Through the iron gate you can see the neat road inside, the continuous gray-black church, the clock tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The towering and majestic church is dominated by Gothic style. The square buildings are mostly made of gray rock. Most houses have a "mountain" shape and the middle is high. , both sides are low. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the top of the church, there are plenty of towering and beautiful spires that represent the symbol of theocracy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exquisite quaint embossed carvings on the eaves are lined up in a row of neatly intensive windows. At the same time, more and more, it gives a sense of solemnity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the center of the entire city, the pillar of all people's hearts - the Church of the Holy Blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have long heard that the architectural world of the Berant Empire is famous. Today, it is spectacular." Bart looked at the Church of the Holy Blood and exclaimed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looked at the church and sighed: "Yeah, the magnificence made me see it many times and it was still very shocking."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two did not stay here for too long, along the side of the Arc de Triomphe to the financial district on the south side of the church, two blocks away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the center of Bain’s financial, imperial banks, city banks, stock exchanges, gold exchanges, branches of world chain companies, gas companies, insurance Companies and so on are here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who work here account for 80% of the entire urban middle class and 90% of the rich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The financial district building has some modern feelings, it is the kind of vertical building, generally around seven or eight floors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While walking on the street and looking for a destination, Bart handed over a card with his own animal skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your erudition has made me see business opportunities. If you are serious in the future, if you seriously study it, you will be able to achieve a high level of achievement. If you encounter If you have any money problems, you can come to us." Bart said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge looked down at the business card, very delicate, with a nice flaming pattern and his name and company name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, are you investing?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bar Features said: "Yes, we are good at discovering talents and hidden gold, and then giving these gold the conditions to shine. As long as the gold shines, we can both Get a good return, isn't it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug collects the business card and says with a smile: “I think our encounter today seems to be destined.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think so too." Bart also laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five minutes later, two people came to the destination, 1241 Kaixuan Road, a tall eight-story building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
