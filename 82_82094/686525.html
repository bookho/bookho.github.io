			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With both hands holding the book, Su Ge feels that he is not holding a book, but an incomparably heavy existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of heaviness is not really heavy in quality, but a sense of spiritual oppression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very clear about the book's extraordinary, but he has no intention to open this book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the one hand, his inspiration tells himself that it takes a huge price to open this book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, it’s too dangerous today, he can’t concentrate on this book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t open the book, his fingers groped twice, and pulled the chain wrapped around the book from the cover of the book and hung it on his own Waist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Determining that it will not fall behind, Su Ge regained his gaze and carefully returned to the curved corridor to continue moving inwards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just two steps away, Su Ge’s inspiration once again felt the danger of violent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instinct in the body rolling forward, just standing on the floor, there has been a hole half a meter wide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the attack is silent, as if the attack suddenly appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s body was bursting with his hair, and his eyes wide open and looked cautiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is well aware that this attack does not come from this dimension, but from the world of vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, his eyes at this time could not see the monsters of the world of vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The worst situation has occurred." Su Ge felt the unprecedented pressure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For some special reasons, the boundaries between the real world and the world of vision have become blurred, and flashbacks are likely to fall into two worlds. Can't get out of the middle world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the case with Su Ge at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be understood that part of Su Ge is already in the world of vision, while the head and vision are in the normal world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the most dangerous situation, because monsters in the world of vision can attack you, but you can't see those beings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to common sense, this situation is impossible. Someone has made special settings here, doing some splitting of the two worlds. The trap, and the purpose, is naturally to kill everyone who comes here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s eyes sparkle with deep radiance: "Or through this special The setting is specially waiting for me to come."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, the heart of the ice began to accelerate and agitated, seemingly desperate to tell the danger is coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, Su Ge did not hesitate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacred night clock continues to emerge from the body, accompanied by a burst of blue mist, dark robes, four dark wings wrapped in Su Ge body of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the falling of black feathers, a god of death appeared in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A crisp crash came, under the dark robes, the strange white hand grasped something out of thin air, so that some invisible attacks could not get close. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, countless blue mists have turned into countless flames, spreading along the palm of the hand to an invisible body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few seconds, it seems that something has been completely lost. It symbolizes the breath of life, and the soul that symbolizes death is completely taken away by Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the dark hood, it seems to open his mouth and swallow these symbols of life and death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking down at the palm of the hand that just resisted the attack, there was a reddish mark on it, and it seemed to be attacked by something like a steel pipe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It should be an unnamed dominator of a hand-held infusion stand." Su Ge simply analyzed it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He then focused his attention on his own form of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As the mysterious source of the world has been enhanced and polluted, the rules of cleanliness and perfection have been broken. The most obvious is the form of the gods and the god of death. The connection between the two is enhanced."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, Su Ge, who evolved into a form of death, apparently felt that his control over death was significantly enhanced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not to say how Su Ge’s knowledge has been strengthened, just because the world’s perfect barriers have been broken, and the god’s faint power can penetrate from the barriers. Come over and let the power of the form of death be enhanced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this, the illusory form of death at this moment, the emergence of a real body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This change makes Suge happy, but more worried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything is relative. If your own power can be revealed, then the power of other gods can still be revealed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking, Su Ge has followed the stairs on the second floor of the innermost side to the third floor bedroom on the most hidden side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time the bedroom door was wide open, the inside of the wardrobe was incomparably messy, the bed was not completely shredded, and it was a mess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After discovering Mela here, Su Ge’s innermost illusion was shattered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked lightly in the bedroom and saw a lace letter on the desk with messy text. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the writing is messy, but with reference to the text on the case, it is still possible to confirm that this is Myra's notes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I heard his voice, the detestable man, the self-proclaimed Naia Latotip, who occupied my body, he... It has brought His coming."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well!?" Seeing this, Su Ge’s eyes tightened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naya Latotip? Seeing this sensitive name made Su Ge nervous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, in his mind, he instantly thought of the man who was pale in the clinic that day, with a cold breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In retrospect, his face is not because of the excessive color of the wine, but because there is no blood that belongs to human beings. He is a kind of non-human existence. Occasionally dozens of completely different faces, he is definitely not what Nayalatotip."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug knows Nayaratotip Several incarnations, no avatars have the appearance of this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, it seems to be a quirky mad monologue, also like a poem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am about to leave the world,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that I have fallen into the abyss,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that I have turned into an abyss,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I absorbed everything,<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw the lake that does not belong to this world,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw countless soft black tentacles,<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have accommodated countless winged monsters,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is beckoning to me,<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can’t resist,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the annihilation of humanity, I am already...become a new god! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this, Su Ge pinches the paper and feels guilty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emeria let him take good care of Myra, fearing that she would become a god of evil for some reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
