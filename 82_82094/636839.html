			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quietly leaving the vows of the manor, a black Su Ge walked back through the cover of the moonlight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mind is still sorting out the information that Emilia told her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The eccentric predictions will be analyzed using the body of the gods to see if you can get any information. What is worthy of my attention is the Expedition of the Holy Swords. Such a terrible force expedition to the abyss, did they find out from the passage that there was a certain threat in the abyss, or did they know that there was such an important thing in the abyss and wanted to take it back?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the current clues, Su Ge can't figure it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The last is this woman named Myra, who is bound by the Holy Blood Maze and the Star Heaven, and can even become a real evil spirit? What kind of character is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For this woman, Su Ge is full of curiosity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking, Su Ge moved quickly along the shadow of the streetlight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Su Ge had just passed through a cemetery, he suddenly felt a violent mysterious wave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Someone is doing something?" Su Ge thought about it, but decided to look at the situation in the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every cult who is doing things in the Camp of the Holy Blood Church is a real warrior, and Suge is prepared to pay tribute to the last legacy of these warriors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smallly walked through two streets, Sug passed through a grove, and the eyes just saw the edge of the cemetery, three people squatting on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lot of new soil around, it seems that the tomb is dug up, looking for something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes looked at it, and Su Ge’s accidental discovery found that two of the three were human beings, and the middle one was a ghoul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thing that surprised Suger is here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he found that this ghoul actually had a master psionic fluctuation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be aware that the Yi people in the normal system of vision are unable to master the knowledge of the world, and naturally cannot use normal mysterious spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where there are exceptions, ghouls are very special groups among the Yi people, and they have very strong learning abilities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even, you can turn people into ghouls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in the group of ghouls, there are many ghouls who have the power to master mysterious spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the master ghoul, he didn’t say it, I heard that I have never heard of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghoul is very powerful in his own mastery. At this time, only the head becomes the original form, and the body remains human. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time he took a look at the human hand beside him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug gaze, suddenly felt a nausea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because that is a human brain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the ghoul got the human brain, the twilight look was happy, whispered: "The squirming brain finally got it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, it opened its mouth and ate this disgusting brain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The brain of the worm? Is that brain a secret treasure?" Su Ge had some surprises. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three people who have achieved this goal turn around and leave quickly, even if the tomb is not ready to cover up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, just when the three people just got out of their way, they were discovered by the church people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are five patrolmen surrounded by them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is a pity that these five clergymen seem to be temporarily dispatched. The most powerful one here is the captain of the night watchman, and it is only the expert level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge gap between experts and masters, there is no way to make up for this amount. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The special resistant carapace of the ghoul has a strong atmosphere to hide, in the case of these clergy, completely unaware of the horror of this ghoul . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge hides in the corner and has no intention of shooting, but does not make the key Mr. consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just wants to watch a show. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s really a dog can’t buy it.” He took the lead of the night watchman’s head, revealing the pale skin that had not received sunlight for a long time, and raised his hand. The thorny iron bar, a burst of mysterious waves came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other night patrols quickly took out their weapons and tacitly directed direct shooting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this evil heresy, there is no need to persuade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along with the shooting of the bullets, there were some strange blue ghosts that rushed to the three cults. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two humans next to the ghoul immediately took out their mysterious costumes and prepared to fight, but were stopped by the ghouls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only seeing him suddenly raise his hand, the human palm is instantly mad, turning into a horrible paw with only one meter in the palm of his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This paw easily blocks the hunting bullets that have been shot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the big paws waved, and with a gust of wind directly grabbed the blue ghosts, and squeezed them hard, they were completely crushed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not good! It is a senior ghoul!" Seeing the ghoul's ability to control the body, the night patrol captain suddenly screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, five people began to retreat quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people are trained and practical and have a wealth of experience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The advanced ghoul is the kind of ghoul who can master the mystery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time as the retreat, five night patrols grabbed a large amount of silver ash from the waist and swayed forward, while a special device was directly crushed. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They are reinforcements, Bishop!" the cult whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghoul glanced at the paws, looking at the clergy behind the silver ash powder, and snorted: "just experiment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, Su Ge clearly felt that his physical psionics began to flow quickly and disappeared, seemingly absorbed by something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the gigantic head of the ghoul seems to have lost its bones and begins to creep and grow up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a full turn, a burst of unspeakable power was passed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, the five night spectators outside ten meters suddenly suddenly felt stiff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then their brains began to slowly creep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the squirming of his head, the five night-watchers suddenly made a tragic cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they rolled their heads in their hands and rolled on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can see that their bodies began to pull out violently, and the seven bleeds, like a huge squeeze on their heads, turned into various shapes, no more than a dozen The second is lying on the ground and motionless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghouls here seem to be a little tired, and after confirming the effect, take people away quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sure enough, it is a secret treasure. It should look like the secret of the same level as the blood sacrifice." Su Ge looked at the horror of the night watchman, calmly analyzing . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
