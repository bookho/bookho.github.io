			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a time, the corridors in the hospital were covered by an invisible force, and others around, including Father Hank, felt only breathing Difficulties, the whole person feels very uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of only expert-level Su Ge, as a master of Nel's chest, the bloody red light suddenly stepped forward, whispered: "Yes Let your people know that the goddess is really powerful!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, the red light in his hand did not leave any hand and suddenly slammed forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a powerful trick that can only be used by a master priest: the punishment of the goddess of bloodmoon!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Behind Neil, the four priests saw this and the expression was full of excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a waste of relationship, ready to accept the sanction of the goddess!" The four priests thought at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the cognition of these people, Su Ge, who has no qualifications and is very young, has come to this step by relationship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They think that Guinness didn’t happen at all, it’s all a play by Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug is just a flower shelf, not worth mentioning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are the old fritters in the church. Su Ge, who is a relationship-oriented person, has heard a lot and has seen a lot. It’s already strange. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge felt himself into a sea of ​​blood, surrounded by countless blood-red monsters rushing toward himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These monsters look very weird. They are like people, but they are slimmer and more embarrassing than people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their bodies seem to be a spine, the ribs around them are exposed, the head is a huge stone, and the stone is covered like a human skull. Raised, it looks very scary and disgusting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These monsters reached out and their claws caught at Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not an illusion." Su Ge was alert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These monsters are all real, and Su Ge can feel it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Su Ge is sure that once he is caught by these monsters, he will be smashed if he is not dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, a loud, sharp bell rang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bell is different from the previous bell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bell is the second special bell invented by Su Ge according to the night clock of the town, with the death knowledge that Su Ge now has. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the bells are spreading, it is also the process of spreading death. The gift of the liberation of death is the night of liberation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Invisible, the ripples of the night of the liberation and the bloody red light collided together, and suddenly the entire corridor reminded of a harsh sound of numerous glass rubbing each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes other people suddenly pale, covering their ears, and their faces are ugly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is this possible!" Seeing this, Nelton was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw his bloody seas gradually become black, and the goddess' messengers also collapsed because of these black gradual fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, 哗啦啦......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A burst of broken glass sounds, red light and The ripples of the night clock that escaped disappeared at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this, the arrogant Nealton was furious and shouted: "You traitor! Heresy! You dare to attack the goddess of the goddess!?" /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge is still calm at this moment, said indifferently: "If you still have self-knowledge, then quickly give me a roll. If you continue to provoke, I don't mind killing you." ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People's endurance is limited, and Su Ge itself is not a tolerant person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous tolerance for Nell was based on the time when Su Ge was in a good mood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sozoe is in a very bad mood now, and this guy who doesn’t know how to be a good one is a slut, a heresy, a traitor, which makes Suge very annoyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, he can’t control his own killings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Kill me!? I don't know the people who are so high, I want you to know the real difference between you and me! Let you know the true power of the stars!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nell was completely provoked at this time. He had lost his sense of reason at this time and his emotions were very low. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was held in the palm of his hand, living in the compliments and admiration of countless people, where he was subjected to such contempt and humiliation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge took a deep breath, and his tone was indifferent to the extreme: "The inferior monkey dog ​​swears two sentences, and you are now crying too much!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The great March goddess gave me a powerful knowledge of the heresy!" Nell suddenly raised his hands high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, Su Ge suddenly felt something coming out of a high-dimensional space, and came to Nell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, Nell’s body showed a faint brilliance, and a burst of whispers that couldn’t help but scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aside, Father Hank and others suddenly fell down, his face full of horror and piety, as if the three goddess came into the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Su Ge’s eyes, I saw three invisible giant objects wrapped around Nell, which gave Nell a very powerful majesty and aerobic field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like... It’s like a god that can’t be seen directly, and people can’t help but bow down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty! Ants!" Nell suddenly made a sound of dignity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this voice, Su Ge’s body trembled and he instinctively wanted to kneel down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Su Ge’s will directly changed his instinct, slowly raised his head, and his dark eyes burned with a faint blue flame. Lonely and awkwardly raised his chin slightly, and asked indifferently: "Don't just summon a breath of breath and dare to pretend to be in front of me? Who gives you the courage!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "You..." I saw that Su Ge could still maintain this in the face of his "destination", and Neer’s heart suddenly burst into a storm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of majesty, this kind of gas field, and even some masters can not resist, this guy is an apprentice, how is this possible! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hanke on the ground saw this heart secretly sigh: "I don’t know the ignorant guy, you only summon a sigh of sacredness, entangled in your own Physically. The one you are facing, but the horror that is truly ignored by the gods!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! Boom! Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three incomparably thick bells sounded and rang in the narrow corridors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge whispered: "Only the bell that rings at the funeral is a symbol, a sacred and solemn ritual. Ignorance, ignorance, self-righteous stupid monkey , now! Feel the death!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Houting...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little bit cold The cold wind blew through, and for a time, everyone felt an indescribable terrorist power coming to the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In silence, countless dark feathers are like black snowflakes, flying in the air and scattered. Like the fallen leaves in the late autumn, the fallen leaves in the sky are heavy, solemn and solemn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Monkey, how do you want to die?" Su Ge sounded with a high authority, indifferent questioning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the god of death is on the verge of a humble human being who is about to die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entanglement of the body that was wrapped around Ner was completely destroyed by the numerous feathers of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The loss of the scent of the gods, Nair's face suddenly pale, his body shivering, plopping a weak force on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time his eyes are wide, as if he saw something, muttering: "I think... I want to..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, an ethereal, clear voice suddenly sounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sound has an indescribable power that instantly empties all the psionics and all the rules of the entire corridor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the corridors filled with countless horror and psionic powers give a feeling of incomparably clean and pure, as if they were directly purified by a force, let When people feel comfortable, they also have a sense of holiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hank and others who lost their pressure slowly stood up, and the funeral that was about to begin was interrupted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Opposite, Nell, who has half a body into the coffin, survived fortunately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, he squinted and squinted, then hurriedly stood up from the ground, his face was incomparably ugly, his eyes looked at Su Ge, with anger and resentment. And there is deep fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger feels that his body is empty, the psionics are lost, the knowledge is lost, and the whole person becomes a pure person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this the power of "Pure Aries"?" Su Ge thought with amazement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This powerful and perverted purifying power makes people chill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In quiet, accompanied by calm footsteps, Emilia came with two guards, sacred, full of fairy eyes on two people I swept away and said faintly: "What? Want to take down our Cathedral of the Holy Blood?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sug does not dare." Su Ge said at this moment, calmly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nell saw Sugg’s look, with disdain in his eyes, glaring at his relationship with Emilia, not rude, hurriedly ran over and said "Sister! I suspect this guy believes in cults. His power is full of death. He also attacked the goddess' messenger and even wanted to kill me directly! I suspect this guy has betrayed the church, you are fast. Point to grab him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Emilia glanced at Nell and said faintly: "Go back now and handle your work now."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sister..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now! Immediately!" Emilia's face with chilly Said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nell opened his mouth and did not continue to speak, turning his head and turning away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four priests returned to the class to return to God, first to the ceremony of Emilia, then turned and quickly followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After waiting for the person to go, Emilia went to the still-shouldered Su Ge, and said coldly, "You have just been too rude." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug did not explain: "Sorry, the Archbishop has failed your expectations of me. Just me...somewhat not really calm."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Emilia ignored him, turned to look at Anthony and Marlene lying in bed, and immediately knew why Sug had just not calmed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are very self-blaming?" Emilia asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded: "self-blame and anger."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you care about them? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I care about all the friends around me, I don't want them to have an accident." Su Ge said truthfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emilia asks: "So I was stunned by anger and prepared to kill a bishop in the Cathedral of the Holy Blood who ruled the church." ?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
