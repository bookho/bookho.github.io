			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At 8:30 in the morning, when people came together, they knew what happened to Su Ge when he returned last night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a time, led by Vanas, a group of people rushed into Su Ge’s bedroom and asked Su Ge to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the exercise of Su Ge’s face and smile, he said that he had no problems, and everyone was relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that Su Ge also said what he got. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They are accelerating production? Damn! What should we do?" Elena's face was gloomy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas turned to ask Mill: "Grandpa, how is your trial?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "There is no effect for the time being, this guy's will is very firm, it will take some time." Mill sighed helplessly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To change the same, we can only do more to strengthen the defense of the palace." Vanas said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s reminder here: “I’m going to dinner at night, this trip can be said to be very dangerous, and there is no mistake, wait for one. We will sum up the escort work of the whole process."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understand!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Re-determine Su After the matter was gone, everyone left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous experience of Su Ge has mastered some tips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the morning, it took only two hours to get back to the body, and in the constant activity, Suge determined that the blood became bloody. There are no problems or injuries on the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He summoned Randall, Vegginia, and Hills to elaborate the escort work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire meeting lasted an hour and a half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After lunch, Su Ge found Mill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "John and Chuan still live like this?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mill nodded: "Well, be prepared to stay as a test article."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" There should be a lot of guinea pigs in the future, so let me use them first," said Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mill looked at Su Ge and didn’t ask: “Take the third room to the left on the third floor, and Marvel will take you past.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Five minutes later, under the leadership of Marvel, Sug saw two poor guys. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two people seem to have no problem on the surface, at this time tied to the cross, the face is gray and desperate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher, I haven't seen you for a long time!" Su Ge asked and smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard the sound, John looked up in a sluggish look and saw Su Ge, then his eyes burst into a burst of light: "Sug! Su Ge! Look at I will bring you to the mysterious face, beg you! I beg you to kill me! I can't stand it! I can't stand it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John burst into tears when he actually collapsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing such a rude John, Su Ge couldn’t help but marvel at Mill’s means and took out the Frost Skull from behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at John with a smile, Sug’s mouth reveals a strange smile: “Dear teacher, although I really want to be “friendly” and “friendly” with you. The old is old, but now that time is tight, I will reluctantly realize your wish!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John wants so much at this time, I heard that Su Ge promised to cry suddenly. The rogue said: "Thank you! Thank you! Su Ge!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looks like, Su Ge seems to be the angel who saved him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hula.........<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the injection of psionic energy, the frost skull burned a cold flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The process may be a little bit painful, but just stick with it!" Su Ge said softly, not waiting for John to react, the cold flame will instantly John burns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh Burning, John first made a scream of horrible screams, and then the call gradually became a suffocating snoring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be seen that a large amount of green energy on John's body is absorbed by the flame and stored in the skull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, John’s body dried up quickly, like a weathered corpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At last, not only the vitality, but even the transparent soul was sucked out, burning fiercely in the cold flame, and finally the whole spirit was integrated with the flame. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few minutes later, a human head size, human shape, burning cold flames, the invisible elf appeared on the skull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one of the special abilities of this Frost Skull, transforming the killed person into a cold flame elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This cold flame elf has some of the power of the cold flame, can carry out auxiliary attacks and defenses, just like those of Rogan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, it can also be used as the eyes of Su Ge for investigation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After being transformed into a sprite form, the soul will lose all the memories and knowledge of life, become the most ordinary and primitive soul, and this kind of soul can't grow. of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Su Ge’s current psionic power, you can control two such elves at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The order was given, and the Han Yan elves circled around Su Ge cheerfully, and then turned into a cold flame into the skull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The side of Chuant saw that this has been stupid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This... this is at least a secret of five levels!" Chuant thought greedily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, his greed was quickly covered by fear, because he found that Suge looked at himself with a dangerous smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing!?" Chuant is still somewhat sensible. He doesn't want to die. He still wants to wait for his own people to capture the palace. The Lord of the Moon will save himself. come out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s sad sigh on his face: “The teacher himself is too lonely. Since you have always been in pairs, it’s natural to pursue the same month. On the same day, but in the same year, the same day and the same day, the same day, I have two places, I am lucky."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't! Don't! Don't die! Lord of the Moon! Save me! Save me! Ah ah..." Chuan began to struggle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Five minutes later, Su Ge satisfactorily opened the door and came out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marvel standing at the door asked: "Are two of them dead?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's dead!" Su Ge spread his hand and turned away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marvel looked slightly sideways, and when they saw the two dead bodies, the green eyes flashed a strange brilliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is what I really want!" Marvel slowly squeezed his fists, as the face of the demon hunter finally showed a slight wave of expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Cold Flame Wizard is ready, find Randall, let him go to the factory there and sneak in to see the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Randall was very pleased to agree that the dark mist that had turned into a dark sky disappeared into the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The preparations are all ready, and there are still four hours from the time of the feast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge, who can't get away, is ready to go to the Royal Library of Guinness, ready to find some books. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But before going, Su Ge first found Vanas to confirm the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
