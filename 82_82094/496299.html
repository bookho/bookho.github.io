			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Little guy, you are too anxious, can't you wait for the fog to come back and find someone else?" The dark mask has a voice with infinite charm. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a soft, tempting, sexy, glamorous voice in the voice, with a temptation that is far beyond ordinary people, just hearing the sound Can make countless men obsessed with, crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge’s forehead gradually oozes a tiny amount of sweat, and when he hears the sound and looks at the body, Su Ge feels that he can’t control his own animality and desire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗷呜! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, at this time, Erha called in a timely manner, and Su Ge returned to God and hurriedly bowed his head, and struggled to run his brain, which was filled with sperm, and asked: "You are...Sheryl Byrondias?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey?" The woman’s mouth made an unexpected sound and seemed to be amazed at Su Ge Can resist your own charm, run your brain and restore your thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a little guy I’m fancy, it’s a human being with such aspirations.” There was a little praise in the voice of temptation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, many men have seen her posture, and these men are apprentices, masters, no one can resist their super charm When I met, I was completely indulged, and losing myself became her jealousy and slave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug is the only person who can not only resist her beauty, but even have a self-conscious mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You really made me feel surprised." Sherry said, walking towards Su Ge with a sexy catwalk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge listened to the footsteps that gradually approached, and in his mind couldn’t help but imagine the tight black robes, the long legs, and the twin crystals. The ankle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly shook his head, the palm of his hand instantly burned the cold flame of the sky, forming a fire wall in front of himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horrible temperature instantly condenses the surrounding fog, and countless ice particles continue to fall, like the hail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this horrible cold flame, Shirley did not go forward, giggling like a charmful goblin-like laughter, the voice said with pleasure "You succeeded in causing my interest in you. Little guy, this is not a good sign."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚咚咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night of the soul of the town sounded three times in a row, and Suge closed his eyes and ran all his energy to simulate the mind's thinking mode. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a dozen seconds, Su Ge suddenly opened his eyes, the dark erect smoldering the cold ghosts and ghosts, some of the expressions are only high, and endless Indifference and condescending contempt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is his first state of mind with the human body using the body of the god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking up to the front, when he saw Shirley’s perfect seductive body, he still couldn’t help but beating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s good that this kind of beating is just the excitement of seeing a pretty female star, and it’s a normal person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Woman, put away your posture of the dagger." Su Ge sounded uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the face of this change in Su Ge, Shirley seems to have already known, not surprising. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The more you look, the more handsome you are!" Sherry said, reaching out to the mask under the white index finger, seemingly stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the big hand waved, the cold flame dissipated, Su Ge looked at the enchanting body less than two meters away from him, and the tone was indifferent: "Woman, tell you The purpose of this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, Shirley’s momentum changed, and the enchanting charm was endless cruel and cold, and the voice was sinister and sinister. Get up, whisper: "I am here to kill you, you have destroyed my perfect plan."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gesture, like this, is like a vicious and fascinating The demon queen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge's attitude is still calm, faint answer: "There is no perfect plan in the world, at least not in your form. And if you are coming to kill me, then you have too much nonsense."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When killing, there is too much nonsense to be killed, that is the kind of stupid low-level creatures of human beings. If you are human, but the form is barely thrown into my vision, I allow you to be rude."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stop, Sugg’s voice rang with a thick bell: "Speak your purpose, woman." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to this, Shirley seems to be annoyed, the white hands are pinched into a cute fist and waved twice, with a spoiled tone: "You People are really annoying and incomprehensible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart of Su Ge once again beats uncontrollably, without speaking, waiting quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even in the mind-thinking form, Su Ge still recognizes her beauty and seductiveness, he even has a faint feeling, his true form of the gods I seem to want to take her back to the throne and be pampered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl is now able to figure out the details of Su Ge’s present, the sound line is mature, full of intellectuality and calm: “For what I made for you Trouble, feelings and feelings?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not enough." Su Ge calmly answered four words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shellyl smirked, and the white fingers curled up with the long, sleek hair on his towering chest, casually asking: "You know What is waiting for you in the city?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s just a bunch of failures." Su Ge said high above. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Failure, giggling, summed up is really accurate. However, you have to know, the failure is the most horrible and the most insane." Shirley The body leaned forward slightly, and the pair of tempting big peaches swayed slightly under the robes, and the sharp-pointed Su Ge even saw two tiny bumps under the robes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pump! thump! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart accelerates again and again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yeah, where are you looking! It's really shy." Shelly suddenly took her arms back to her chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, how can the slender arms of the white scorpion protect the pair of murders, and the gesture at the moment gives a temptation to refuse to welcome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge squinted and put all his attention on her dark mask: "As the head of the enemy, come over today to leak "Is your own information?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am not a leader, just an errand. But! I like this mess."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of her hands behind her back, her body leaned forward: "So, let's make another deal, how?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Say." Su Ge is not too malicious to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the last thing, she was much more important to give herself intelligence than to give herself trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can even be said that it is helpful to help him through some convenience and to implement his future plans more conveniently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the next few days, I will gradually kill all the people who go up the mountain, and let you fall into despair and fear." Shirley casually Said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, including yourself." Shirley added with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh!?" Su Ge browed and said, "Let's see if you have this ability."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, he said: "Conditions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure you want to know? Oh!" Shelly stepped forward again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugeton smelled a special scent during the breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This fragrance is not strong, but it is very fragrant, very smelly, like the peach blossoms in the bed, giving a pink enamel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge was secretly vigilant and said: "Of course."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, this is a bureau, a Byron Dias and a city of trouble. Bureau."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge listened to his heart and asked with vigilance: "What is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "This information can't be finished directly. I will continue to tell you when I have a chance later!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, countless dark surges stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge brows slightly wrinkled: "This is boring."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Giggle, this way It’s interesting!” Xue Lier said, and suddenly came to Su Ge in the next moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge did not move, did not dodge, did not counterattack, calmly looked at her close. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scent is stronger, the visual impact is greater, and Su Ge’s brow locks deeper, forcibly controlling the swaying heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white little hand slowly lifted up and gently smoothed Sug’s brow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white finger has an amazing touch, and the unimaginable comfort of being touched, so that he can't help but groan and want to hold her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You frown too fierce, I don't like too fierce men!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that, the body turned into a black mist, disappeared, disappeared, and the bodies of those who were mad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Su Ge was just about to relax his vigilance, he suddenly felt a warm gasping sensation in his ear, like Shirley’s ear in his ear. Blowing like a blue whispered: "Be careful of the ground and the stone, giggling..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the goblinish smile gradually drifting away, Su Geyi Ass sat on the ground and gasped, and I could see Su Ge’s face and ears red, hot and hot, like the introverted little boy who had just been tuned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
