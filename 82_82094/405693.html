At this time, more police officers rushed over and quickly pulled the cordon around. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Followed by, more clergymen rushed over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now, the mysterious defense system of Bain City is quite good." Su Ge stood up and clap his hands, and picked up the cane that was inserted aside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tang En nodded: "After the Archbishop came here, he re-adjusted the entire mysterious defense system of Bain City, and re-adjusted it. There are a lot of people, and now the mysterious defense system here is in line with the first-tier cities."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Archbishop is really a generation of sages." Su Ge from the heart of admire Road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tang En said with amazement: "Yes, it is our pleasure to dedicate our faith to the goddess under the control of the Archbishop." /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don, what's the matter!?" At this moment, a rushing voice came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twen turned and smiled and said: "Captain Anthony, it’s all right. The lost witch has been surrendered by Bishop Sotos."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Lost Control Witch!?" The voice was shocked first, then suddenly said: "Wait, who are you talking!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge turned his head at this moment and looked at Father Anthony and smiled: "How, don't you know me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than half a year, Anthony looks like Nothing changed, but the spirit and temperament are much more stable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hahaha! How can I forget it!" Anthony laughed and stepped forward and hugged Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug also hugged his broad shoulder and sighed: "There has been no return in the past six months. It is like a world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't feel like I was separated, I feel that you are not the Su Ge I know at all." Separate, Father Anthony looked at Su Ge and sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the side of Dunn whispered, "The captain, after all, is the bishop, the necessary etiquette still has to be."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony listened to the stunned, then slightly covered The finger said at the forehead: "I have seen the bishop."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge generously waved his hand: "Okay, don't see too much."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a simple greeting, everyone put their eyes on the broken, dry body on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The lost witch, this is too dangerous, but fortunately you let you meet, and then it is unimaginable." Anthony said with a gratitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge asked: "I just heard Charlie say that it is not very peaceful recently, what is going on?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is Charlie?" Father Anthony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next side of Charlie hurriedly introduced himself, and his face was nervous and expressed his existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Anthony nodded slightly: "I don’t know what happened recently, the mysterious incident has indeed increased a lot, but so far I have not found where the source is." Br /> /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time the church staff came over and picked up a stretcher witch and put it on it, covered it with a black wool blanket and carried it away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the aftercare work was handed over to Dunn and Charlie. Su Ge took the carriage under Anthony’s and went to the new holy blood of Bain City. church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How have you been in the last six months?" Su Ge asked. Father Anthony smiled and said: "All good, promotion for promotion, salary increase. Roland has now become a formal clergyman." Rogan has been promoted to the rank of the Catholic Church and is the second-in-command of Bain City. He is responsible for the command and control of the church at night."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ivan has not changed, I still study my own things every day, God is mysterious. Right, your dog seems to be enough for Ivan, and is dragged around by Lobo every morning and night. Oh, but thanks to Lobo. The running in the past six months has made Ivan's fragile physique a lot stronger, and his face and temperament are much better."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge heard the satisfaction of this face, and then tempted to ask: "Are you interested in going to Guinness?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go to Guinness?" Anthony first A glimpse, then I learned the meaning of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't care when I get there, anyway, I am a bachelor now, everywhere." Anthony said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge patted his shoulder: "I am applying to the Archbishop for a warrant, and I want to transfer those of us to the other side. How do you see it?" ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is of course good, but does the Archbishop agree?" Anthony has no objections. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge mysteriously smiled: "I have agreed. One of the things I came back this time is to complete this handover."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It would be best if you can. You may not know, now the new bishop of Bain City can’t do anything, every day, I’m researching what’s going on. Things come, mess around all day, and finally get some of the time-consuming and laborious useless work from scratch."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recalling this new bishop, Anthony is full of belly Grievance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He seems to be the little boy who just came out of the Stars of Heaven?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anonymous nod Dao: "Well, self-proclaimed, knowing a lot, thinking advanced, theoretical things a lot, no practical. Look down on this, look down on that. If this is not the archbishop here to guide him, estimate the whole shell Encheng was messed up by him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge heard a slight tilt from his mouth and said, "This is a bit interesting."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two people talked about each other for more than half a year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After fifteen minutes, the carriage returned to the Basilica of the Holy Blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no difference between the current cathedral and the cathedral half a year ago. It seems that the former cathedral has come through time and space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is there any subsequent impact on the incident?" two people walked into the door and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony sighed: "How could it have no effect? ​​Over the past six months, there have been many mysterious forces coming over to investigate the situation, and the legacy of the past has attracted a lot of The Yi people even have many Yi people we have never seen before."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Similar to this thing?" Su Ge will turn the face of the ice sculpture into the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, this thing is very annoying. Although the attack is not strong, they carry some very troublesome brainless insects."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This thing is called a face rat, a lower-level Yi, 25 points can be seen." Su Ge said his intelligence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have seen this!!" Anthony was a little surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded: "I have seen it six months ago."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people talking Already in front of the Basilica of the Holy Blood, Griffin seems to know that Su Ge has returned and is waiting at the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bishop, the Archbishop is waiting for you." Griffin said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly and turned to Anthony and said, "I will go through a process first, and I will call an acquaintance tonight, and have a meal together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good." Anthony nodded happily and left with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following Griffin into the Basilica of the Holy Blood, the internal pattern is the same as before. After entering, it is a middle hall with a rounded roof and the second floor on both sides. There are silver-gray exquisite statues on the walls, ten on each side, symbolizing the greatest 20 popes of the Church of the Holy Blood for so many years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people stepped on the steps and walked in the middle of the road. In the aisle on the left and right sides, you could see some busy figures of clergy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the Zhongtang Corridor, enter the dome of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark gold prototype has a colorful mural on the dome, surrounded by six dark gold square pillars, and a large number of solid woods in the empty hall. The chair is used by the believers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the slightly high platform in front of it, there are three statues of different colors, white, purple and red symbolizing the three goddesses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These three statues are carved with white jade as the core, and the specially treated colored ochre outside, carved in three different colors. The robes of the goddess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The look of the goddess is not clear, but people can see that there is a quiet and peaceful deep in the soul of the direct human being, instinctive calm down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the statue, two people are kneeling on the ground to pray. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle is still wearing a pale pink robes, with a silver-gray long hair Emilia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside her is a young man dressed in a bishop's costume, blond hair, gold-rimmed glasses, and very gentle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are twenty-five years old, about one meter tall and seventy-five, with a slightly fat body, fair skin, and a slightly green temperament. The feeling of the milk taro. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug turned to look at Griffin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Griffin nodded slightly, indicating that this "milk gimmick" is the younger brother of Emilia, born in the Stars of Heaven, Bishop, Nel Ulia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of two people praying seems small and big. In particular, the sacred voice of Emilia's ethereal voice, in the whisper of whispers, echoed in the vast range of the dome of the whole god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The solemnity is as if the messenger of God from the sky is proclaiming something to the people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two people waited quietly after the arrival, without any movement, listening carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Five minutes later, the voice of prayer gradually stopped, and the two stood up and turned around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emilia looked at Su Ge, his face was so sunny and awkward smile: "How about feeling after half a year?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
