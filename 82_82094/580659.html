			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have a problem, since the gods rely on faith, but those outside God are not believers." Su Ge looked at Shirley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley turned over and hugged the pillow and said: "External gods certainly do not need believers. They themselves are a kind of long-lasting thing, and the astral The stars are similar things. They need believers and believers because they want to enter the material world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Like you?"< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley snorted and agreed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug said nodded clearly, then sighed: "Outside God, the old dominator, the March goddess, the god of the ancients, and the great gods, It seems that every group has a very different purpose, and things are much more complicated than I thought."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What Shirley wants to say, but just After closing his mouth, he patted the pillow and said, "Nothing was done yesterday, make up today!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At ten o'clock in the evening, the three-story VIP area has been relatively quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elegantly decorated corridor is quiet and does not see a person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cool breeze blew, and an invisible thing that was hard to see was coming to the front of Su Ge, and then went in through the gap in the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the submersible magic that only the wind sorcerer can make. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not only is it transparent, but it can change the shape like the wind and penetrate into the gap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only downside is that the controllable range is only 30 meters and it is very consuming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room was a little dim at this time, only the bedside lamp was on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no rush to get close to the bed, but climbed up along the sofa and saw the two people on the bed hold together at this moment, whisper What is it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look closely at the two people, at this time two people lying under the quilt, from the psionic fluctuations of the breathing, should be a profession or an expert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this makes the owner of the devil feel a little peace of mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the end, the profession and the experts are somewhat inaccurate, but the vigilance of the two people is indeed a bit poor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Iyeta thought in his heart, control the slow-moving approach of the two people in the corner of the baggage, hoping to find some clues about the true identity of the two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "From an imposing point of view, women are ordinary people, there is no psionic fluctuation, and men's psionic fluctuations are relatively strong, first look at male luggage." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking, let the magic enter the box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as I entered, Ieta felt that something was slowly creeping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, she is lost and connected with the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeita in the room suddenly turned pale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What the hell is that!!" Ieta's face is very ugly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She clearly felt that she was not lost contact with her own enchantment, but that her enchantment was horrified after entering the box. The existence of it is eaten! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The man is definitely not simple!" Iyerta's spirit is not very good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of her psionics in the demon, causing the death of the devil to cause some rebellion against her spirit, causing her heart to be violently shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take a deep breath and calm down the spirit of the shock, Iyeta called Pigu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The whole journey, don't provoke these two people, I will wait for the Glory City, I will let people deal with it."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the pale face of Iyeta, Piguton was secretly scared, and then it was a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How powerful Iyeta is, he is very clear, and this man is not even sure to deal with Ieta! ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I actually provoked such a terrible mystery without knowing it! ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咕噜! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pigu swallowed his mouth, and the hand that clenched his cane was a little trembling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third floor is in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug sat by the bed and waved at the suitcase. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The suitcase then automatically opened from the inside, a large black cloak like a life, ran to the front of Su Ge, then curled into a mass of squirming, spit out a thing . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looked at the enchantment made of clear crystal in his hand, and a smile appeared on the corner of his mouth: "The cause and effect of this thing is really unavoidable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley lie lazily and ask: "Female Warlock?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, this Behind the big man there is actually a female warlock supporting the waist, no wonder that the gas is so full." Su Ge laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kill?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course, I have a feeling that this female warlock I will definitely meet in the future," Su Ge said as he looked out the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s also a trouble, it’s better to kill now.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug confident smile "I can't solve the problem. It's called a stepping stone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he finished, he hugged her from behind Shelly to the bed: "Sleep."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sleep so early?" Shirley took a moment to lean on Suge's arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger’s chin is placed on her sexy white shoulder: “The mouse’s dream is ripe and mature, are you interested?”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't go, the big octopus has something to look at."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you not like seafood?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dreck feels very, very bad at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The auditory hallucinations in his ear are getting more and more serious. I just got some sleeping pills in the boat doctor and finally got some sleep feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be hallucinations that have affected his spirit, causing him to be very uncomfortable even if he sleeps, as if something is entangled in himself and gradually infects his spirit and will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he feels that he seems to be in the boundary between waking and sleeping, his mind is very messy, he wants to sleep and can’t sleep, he wants to wake up and wake up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The uncomfortable feeling doesn't know how long it has been, he finally fell asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he made a dream, an incomparable real dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He dreams that he seems to be submerged by the sea, his body keeps falling down, and the seawater is pouring from his nose and his mouth into his lungs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just when he feels that he is suffocating immediately...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A burst of incomparable real baby crying came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, he felt himself awakened and suddenly woke up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after waking up, he found himself not in his own cage-sized room, but in a very wide area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This should be in a cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is surrounded by oddly shaped stones, full of disgusting moss and coral. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a very stinking smell in the cave, as if countless dead fish have been placed for too long and decayed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where is this?" Drake was a little shocked at the moment, and seemed to be somewhat mentally retarded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air is damp, the feet are muddy, and Drake stumbles forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, he seems to have stepped out of the cave and came to a very wide place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly looked up, he was surprised to find himself in an underwater world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a huge suffocating horror in the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to be in the sea and forms the bottom of the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to be sitting there, forming a skeleton that supports the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It also seems to be standing there, it is the sea itself! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the vague figure, Drake blinked his eyes as if all the sights were attracted by the huge figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"咕噜...咕噜......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his God, he heard it in his ear Some ugly voices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These sounds seem to come from the shackles, but they are extremely disgusting and unpleasant, like a person who has a lung disease, a strong breath when he is stuck in the scorpion. The sound, just sounds, makes people feel sick and disgusted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked down at the sound, his face gradually became frightened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he found that he did not know when he had been surrounded by a group of scary fish people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes...the fishman!" Draketon was so pale in his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the adventures that I have experienced in the past have allowed him to witness these horrible things in one accident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For years, the secret peek was his boastful talk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he never thought that this horrible monster actually found himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Auntie...scream!" These fishermen screamed and tied Drake directly with a rope woven with seaweed, at Drake Struggling and screaming, lift him to other places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No! No! Let me go! No! Don't eat me! Don't eat me!" Drake struggled desperately, but to no avail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fish people seem to be completely ignorant of his words, and perhaps these fish people simply do not bother to understand his words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Drake fell into despair, Su Ge and Sherry stood somewhere in this dream space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s really Laleille." Su Ge looked around with a little surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley raised his hand and licked his nose: "This taste is really bad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Suge raised his hand and moved: "It's not the real Laleille, but the projection of Laleille. Although my powers are subject to some restrictions and restrictions here, there is not much restriction."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley looked up and looked up: "You can really sleep."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug With the huge shadow in the ocean, he smiled and said: "After you wake up, can you really destroy the world?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl did not answer, bowed Looked at the ground and said, "Your little mouse is going to die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge looked down and found that the deep dives pressed Drake at this time. On the altar of the five-pointed star-shaped stone, two large deep dives stood next to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A deep dive holds a jagged shell knife, and another deep dive holds a dark substance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
