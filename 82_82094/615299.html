			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Son of God opened the hundreds of eyes, the cold eyes swept around, and the eyes above and below the body with a variety of looks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having a look, curious, insightful, contemplative, and eager...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All The eyes looked around and all the eyes rolled over and looked at Su Ge holding his own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A burst of illusory breath rose from his body, and then the sturdy baby flew from Su Ge, and the eyes of the whole body turned again and moved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow wow! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of a wave of waves is coming out of his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knights around him suddenly became dignified and tightened their arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They feel a deep hostility on this baby at this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg’s voice at this time: “Quiet!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, that cry The abrupt end is like the whole world being muted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, even if the wind does not dare to blow, the water does not dare to flow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The baby’s dark eyes with awe and fear, the mouth squirming but no sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the kingdom of Su Ge, where He has absolute power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Spouse the media." Su Ge’s voice said with an order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Son of God Ace listened to his open mouth and spit out a soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This soul seems to be about to be dissolved, not the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge reached out to the soul, the secretive gods launched, Drake’s soul quickly returned to normal, even in the intention of Su Ge, to him The soul has been strengthened a little, and some of the backhands that he needs in the material world have been buried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now, leave." Su Ge briefly said four words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Snowy said, God’s thinking is completely different from that of human beings. For God, there is no feeling for the child, the spouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although Ace is not the son of Su Ge, it is the creation that he personally reshaped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he still has no feelings about the monsters he created. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't say it is family and love, not even a sense of accomplishment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, there is only the indifference and command of condescending. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aesther shivered nodded, the whole body's eyes flashed with countless silver brilliance, and the body turned into a stream of light into Drake's soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drake's soul is His container, the embarrassment of His growth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all maturity, Drake’s soul will completely wither, and He will be completely born as before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The next step is to unravel the secrets of the church in March." Su Ge’s big hand, Drak’s soul disappeared instantly, I don’t know. There. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Retreat." Sug turned his head and said to the six knights, and the body became a fog disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next moment, Su Ge has sat on the throne, leaning on the throne, and Suge closed his eyes to reflect on the situation and recalled himself. Feeling human, slowly said: "The inferior existence makes me want to crush them all, but it does not have fun."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" However, That's not what I need, what I long for." The next second, the kind of curiosity and interest has disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open your eyes, Su Ge was born: "Come in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is silently opened, Vanas respectfully walked in for a routine report. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing, Vanas first told Adeline that she had said something about the female warlock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take it to the clock holder." Su Ge said faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas nodded respectfully and then said: "According to your will, I have sent your devotees, Luke began to unilaterally work with other organizations. Docking."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Geen expressed satisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The report is finished, the servant retreats." Vanas said with respectful exit from the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luke, as the former archbishop with the power of the lord, his occupation is the opposite of the bloodletter of Father Water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the Bain City incident, he seemed to be looking for something with the undead Crowson, who came to Guinness and Vanas 10 months ago. A meeting was held. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clawson also came here at the time, but after hearing the news of the storm emperor, hurriedly left, it seems that something important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Luke came, after seeing the horror of Vanas, he was very happy to join the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After entering the Kingdom of God, he was able to witness what was true and offered all his faith and piety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These days, he has been recuperating in Guinness, and he is secretly cultivating mysterious people while being familiar with the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlike the priest Watt, who is a maze guard, Luke is a graduate of the class and has studied in the Starry Heaven. All the knowledge is very systematic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now he is the owner of the Valley Court, that is, the plague apostle alternately has the same identity as Adeline and others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, because of his existence, Guinness is now running and developing very smoothly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Familiar with the style and system of the Church of the Holy Blood, as well as the insider, led the subordinates to have secretly extended their tentacles to the northeastern province of the Belland Empire, and acted Very smooth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luke is very happy with his new faith and new identity, especially for the teachings of the Church of the Late Bells, which is a savvy experience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Awaken from the dream, Su Ge opened his eyes and saw that Shirley was lying beside him, his white fingers were licking his hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Handle it?" asked Shirley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge stretched out his arms and hugged her: "Well, everything is going well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “What's next?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Nature is doing our great work.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Oh, it depends on whether you have the ability." Shelly said flatteringly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;..................<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, in the northeastern province, a city In one of the bars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two men are sitting in a corner, laughing and drinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have always envied the teachings of the Elf Order, because you can't help but drink." Luke said, shaking his bottle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sitting opposite him is Lance of the Elf Order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who can think of it, the blood-sucker who made half of the mysterious world stunned, is actually his." Lance holds a glass of wine, slightly sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luke leaned on the chair and smiled: "There is nothing impossible in this crazy world."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lance asked curiously: "Does he dare to release you as a representative of the church in the late bell, isn't he afraid of completely angering the church in March?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Luke said casually: "Reassure, they won't recognize me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But I know," said Lance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
