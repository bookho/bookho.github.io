			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the way down the mountain, Su Ge has some heart and soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, I am smart enough, or I might be a fart today." Sug recalled Luke’s powerful psionic power and looked awkward. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just two people had an hour of good talks and achieved very good results, and reached a deep consensus on the issue of the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Luke highly praised Su Ge’s mentality and prudence and expressed his approval and praise for Su Ge’s rescue of the witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge gives Luke’s powerful ability to affirm and express sympathy for his past experiences. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two exchanged opinions with each other and became a good strategic partnership. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the two separated, Luke said that he had to deal with the long hair on his body first, and then talk about the details. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The repression of the night clock lasts for forty-eight hours, during which time Luke handles personal hygiene and gains a new identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contemplative Su Ge returned to the village. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After entering the village, I saw a large group of villagers gathered in the square in the middle of the village, seemingly looking at something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug got closer and looked at it. A white-haired middle-aged man in a black priest’s robe is making a benevolent preaching, saying that the faith is shining. The benefits of the Lord and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For this missionary, Su Ge is not surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bertrand Empire is not a country, and its belief is relatively free. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as you are registered, legal religion can be believed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, this glorious church is a very old church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also many churches that will be similar to Guanghui, including the Forest Order, the Home of the Elf, the Temple of the Sun, and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as the doctrine is positive and conducive to human solidarity and peace, you can freely preach in the empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge did not stay here, directly found the village chief who was still waiting, and showed him the body of the bat, indicating that the crusade had been End. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old village chief said with a happy face: "Thank you, Mr. Sotos, thank the goddess for their shelter."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled and looked down at the time, only twelve o'clock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, yes! The church said that there seems to be a water ghost nearby, let me investigate, can you point me to the location?" said Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old village chief listened to some unnecessary words: "That, I thought you were not responsible for this matter. Just passed a few missionaries and said that they can help We solved the water ghosts at the cost of letting them preach in the village. I agreed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge heard some accidents and said: "It seems It’s not an ordinary missionary!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Nothing, tell me where I am, I’ll see it in the future, if they’re not professionals, what’s left? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old village chief listened to the gratitude of his face and sighed: "Thank you for thinking about us, you can meet a clergy like you, it is me." The greatest honor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled, and politely thanked, got the specific address from the village head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The location of the water ghost appears on the riverside about three hundred meters south of the village. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This river is a tributary of the Igo River. The river is about 20 meters wide and 30 meters deep. The flow rate is not high enough to drive small vessels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The richness of aquatic products in Hanoi is one of the main economic sources of Laihua Village. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Su Ge had just arrived at the river, he had heard the anxious voice of a farmer before he saw it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can't blow! Can't blow! Here is the irrigation canal, it will be cultivated immediately, and the field inside will be welded!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's go! A small farmland is a big threat compared to a water ghost nest. You don't know?" A clear and firm voice came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No! No! This is going to blow up, and we can't live this year!" The farmer's voice was crying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing such an anxious voice, Su Ge quickly ran over. After crossing a bridge, Su Ge saw a farmer looking at three people with a look of grief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These three people dress differently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Headed is a horsewoman wearing white heavy armor, carrying a shield and carrying a long sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knight's armor is very strict, the whole body can only see a pair of blue eyes, the other is covered in the armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has two men around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A man is burly, dressed in a quirky black robe with a triangular helmet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a knife around his waist and a big axe behind his back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second attire is very familiar, with one big and one small sword behind it, handcuffs and explosives around the waist, and a variety of medicines on the thighs. The bottle is a demon hunter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point the knight pushed the farmer away and prepared to put the bomb in his hand on the edge of a canal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop!" Seeing this, Su Ge screamed and ran over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the farmer’s anxious pleading, Su Ge’s heart was aching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parents of his earth are peasants. When he was a child, he remembered very clearly, because the road was built on the side of the ground, and he pressed a lot of cultivated land and watched it squashed. The tender seedlings were crying several times to his mother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For farmers who have no other income, cultivated land is everything for them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very aware of the results of the bombing of the canal, which means that a large area of ​​farmland after the canal is likely to be welded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The farmer over there was rescued after seeing Su Ge, and ran over and pleaded: "Father! Father! I beg you to persuade these three adults." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge took a deep breath and said softly: "Don't worry, sir. I will help you with this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you, thank you!" The farmer heard this soft comfort and couldn't help but cry out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reassure the farmer, Sug turned to look at the three hostages and asked: "Who are you? Who gave you the right to blow up the canal here?" Br /> /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The armor knight carefully looked at Su Ge and said: "We are at the invitation of the village chief to deal with the water ghosts by the river. Now the water ghost's lair is built in this Under the canal, I have to blow it up and slash the water ghost."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the strong man with a big axe snorted and asked: " We are missionaries of the Glorious Church. Who are you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge went forward and took out his identity card: "The Church of the Holy Blood, Purple The moon traveler, Su Ge Sotos."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ziyue on behalf of the walker!?" Hearing this, the three people were surprised at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to their information, the clergy of this institution is not an ordinary clergyman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge stepped forward and stopped them and said, "This canal cannot be blown up. This matter is now officially handed over to the Church of the Holy Blood, and you can leave." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demon hunter on the side stared at Su Ge with a pair of golden erects, and made a voice without any feelings: "How do I feel that you are sheltering these water ghosts?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug turned his head and stared at him tit-for-tatly: "I don't cover you, you are not qualified to judge. From your actions, you are already seriously threatened." By the security interests of the Goddess people in March, I have great doubts about your behavioral philosophy. Please leave immediately."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
