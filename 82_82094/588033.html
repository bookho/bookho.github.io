			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third day of the Saurani Ocean Cruise, the Opera House. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole hall is not big, so you can sit down more than 100 people. This is a relatively high-end place for the whole cruise ship. You can sit here and watch the opera. It is a high-ranking person with a certain background or money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug and Sherry sit at the far right of the first row and look down at the flyer in their hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because she is not willing to be close to others, Sog is on the left and the wall is on the right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leaflet is very beautiful, with a total of three pages, all using very advanced color printing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The content of the opera mainly tells the story of a deceased princess revenge on the enemy with the help of a wizard wizard, and finally the story of the genus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole opera is divided into three acts, today is the first act, tomorrow and the day after tomorrow are the second and third act. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I heard that the author of this opera is a very well-known writer who has written many scripts and novels and is very popular in the whole world." Shirley for this Something about text is more interesting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge turned over and looked at the original: Elf Dancer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it a pen name?" Su Ge was surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The days of writers in this era are very difficult, and every writer is very much looking forward to being famous, making it easier for others to find themselves, so almost all authors use their own Real name is published. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This pen name, Su Ge is still seeing for the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirle continued: "I have read this book, the story is very refreshing, the violent flip and the final domineering, the people who watch it are very happy. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sports marriage? I have already seen the sputum in this bridge." Su Gexing put down the leaflet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shelly said something unhappy: "Do you really think of yourself as omniscient? Where did you see the bridge that was married?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Amount..." Sugerton was a little dumb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bridge is what he saw in martial arts novels and online novels in high school. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shelly touched her chin and said, "I still appreciate this little bug. I can feel the darkness and violentness of his heart. I have seen it. In his few books, almost every novel has different themes. Some are stories of the rise of the illegitimate children of the aristocracy. Some of them are remarried because of the disability of the big family. They even have been betrayed by relatives and returned to their backs a few decades ago. Reborn..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait!" Suggton was surprised when he heard this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bridge is not something that the people of this world can think of during this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "These books are written by this elf dancer?" Su Ge confirmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley nodded and said calmly: "How? Was it shocked by the thinking of this bug?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is interested to say: "I am only very curious about his origins, is he still alive?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course He seems to be famous for a few years. Now he is the chairman of the League of Literary literary guilds, the honorary archbishop of the Nighthawk Church, the Imperial Knights and the like." Shirley said casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s heart said: “Don't the other traversers? These bridges are all common bridges in online novels.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this world where most people are still struggling, the spiritual entertainment of people is relatively poor, the food is not enough, and there is time to study these illusory things. ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking that the curtain on the stage has been opened, the first thing that appears is a beautiful blonde woman wearing a princess dress behind her There are two soldiers in armor and armed with swords. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole performance was very smooth, but for Su Ge, the future youth who used to watch special effects movies, it seemed very boring at first sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately this is an opera, the actress’s singing is really good, and the female lead is also eye-catching, overall, Su Ge feels It’s more comfortable than watching a sci-fi blockbuster in the cinema. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first act was a total of two hours, played the Elf male mage to help the female host to form an army, ready to counterattack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not bad." When she was in the field, Shelly commented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you all!" The actors on the stage bowed and the sweet voice of the actress kept many men's minds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge's sensitive ear can hear a lot of men's heartbeats have begun to accelerate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can foresee that for this heroine tonight's right tonight, there will be a bloody hurricane competition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Su Ge had just got up, he heard some special shocks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This vibration is not the sound of the heart, but the throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ms. Mary, I love you!" A tall, fat man was rushing to the stage from the second row, with greed and jealousy. The dynasty rushed over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This appeared very suddenly, and suddenly scared this heroine who had no preparations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the actor is beside him, stepping forward in front of the heroine and whispering: "Sir, please pay attention to your etiquette." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get out of the way!" The chubby man’s arm slammed, like a child, and launched the actor over a meter away. On the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss Mary!" The slightly fat man's expression was awkward, staring greedily at the heroine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heroine reacted at this time, and hurriedly turned to run down the stage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the gentlemen below saw this scene, suddenly furious, several middle-aged gentlemen rushed over to find this rude guy theory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, just looking at them, waiting for them to talk, the slightly fat man directly picked up his hand and pinched their neck, actually licking their neck from the ground Pick it up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then slammed, throwing them out like throwing trash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this scene, the people who are going to walk past are suddenly chilling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This power has gone far beyond normal people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss Mary!" The chubby man screamed wildly, and the body rushed up, grabbing the actress who was just about to jump off the stage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then hold her in her arms and kiss them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't! Don't! Don't!" The heroine struggled constantly and made a scream in her mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the crucial moment, a very ordinary silver-gray cane did not know to throw it from there and squatted on the head of the young man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This moment broke his forehead and a lot of blood flowed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who!?" The chubby man screamed angrily and suddenly turned his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge then stepped onto the stage and spread his hand: "Although there are some clichés, I still stand up after thinking about it. Although I have no interest in saving the United States, But your appearance is indeed too ugly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little fat youth does not care about the blood on his forehead, holding the heroine in one hand, shouting: "I want to kill You are a worm! Use my powerful power!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said, the throat made an unpleasant gasping, coming towards this side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge raised his hand and said calmly: "I think there is a psychological problem in your heart. I happen to be a psychiatrist. I have two kinds of here. The way you calm down. One is to talk calmly, the other is physical calm, which one do you want to use?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Responding to Su Ge’s A violent punch of the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s body retreats lightly, avoiding this fist and sighing and saying: “Hey, it seems that you need to be physically calm.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chubby young man looks at Su Ge like the heroine holding the rag doll, and the pale face screams, "Mr., be careful."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shut up! You are my woman!" said the little fat young man, rushing to run, like a flying car rushing toward Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger’s ear is slightly moving, and a special shock is clearly heard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This shock comes from the bones of the young body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His body is no longer able to withstand this inhuman power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a punch of power and horror, Su Ge’s body sideways to avoid, then his legs are arched, his body suddenly rushes forward, and his left hand grabs it at a very fast speed. Lived in his neck, the body suddenly followed, and the left leg mixed behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a muffled sound, under the gaze of the crowd, this man of heavy weight was pressed to the ground by Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a scream of crazy screaming in the mouth of the chubby man, his limbs began to struggle, his nose and saliva were flying, his eyes were full of bloodshot eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge was calm and calm, holding his neck in one hand, and his right hand picked up the cane and waved it at his neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man suddenly became stagnant, and then his body fainted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The farce ends here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a quiet, Su Ge looked down at the undecided, full of shocked and looked at her heroine and said: "You are safe, madam. Very Sorry, I can't help you, my fiancee is watching me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, the heroine blinked and turned a little I glanced at it and saw a very attractive and charming woman looking at herself calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you for your help, brave and elegant gentleman." The heroine stood up and said with gratitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A closer look can see that there is a disappointment in her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fear of despair, a handsome and powerful gentleman came forward to save himself, is the romance of every woman's heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guards who knew the situation finally arrived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the habitual apology, this captain was not surprised by Su Ge’s shot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before he saw it, he had already got the relevant order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Assassin, can you delay some of your time? I need you to cooperate with our investigation." The captain said respectfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly: "Okay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain sighed with relief, then Said to the heroine: "Miss Mary is okay?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing, thanks to this brave gentleman." The heroine Mary said with a lingering heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain said with apologetic apology: "I am sorry, I will compensate you for your troupe. Now please also leave with us to assist in the matter." Investigation and recording."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
