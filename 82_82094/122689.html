			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sitting on the steam locomotive of the police station, Su Ge leaned on the chair with a tired face, and his eyelids could not be opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg, who was going to run back, happened to have a steam locomotive. Because it was too far away, Suge decided to use his identity as a detective to make a credit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result is successful. According to the description of the conductor, the police can take credit for the steam locomotive, but they must register. The cost of this is usually reimbursed by the police station of the steam locomotive at the weekend of the week. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This morning, it’s really dead." Su Ge looked at the window and thought, couldn't help but want to sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can't sleep, the situation is still unclear, who knows if anyone is watching me now!" Thoughts, Su Ge stretched out his hand in his thigh Squeezed hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strong pain stimulates the spirit of wilting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The main question now is how to tell Bartle's intelligence to Master Gerlos? It is too easy to be suspicious to say it directly. But this piece It’s about the people in the whole city, and you can’t drag it down.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Su Ge was caught in a dilemma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The museum’s experience can be said until the attack. But from meeting with Bart and returning to the museum again, you can’t say that. Is intelligence inserted into these experiences?" Su Ge frowned and fell into meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sound...to the voice. I have some talent for this. I can push it all over to Joseph. Anyway, he is going crazy now. No one can be found missing, and there is no evidence of death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Su Ge’s heart settled down and decided to cut Bart’s intelligence and pick some core important things. Let them say it through the mouth of "Joseph." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am a genius!" Sug smiled and never praised himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half an hour later, Su Ge returned to the police station. When he walked into the police station with exhaustion, time has come to eleven o'clock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the entire police station was empty, except for the civilian staff responsible for the reception at the front desk, others were gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a lot of autumn!" Su Ge thought, running back to the office and drinking a large cup of high-concentration coffee, and applied for the last police station. The carriage went to the farm in the north of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The farm at this time has been completely blocked by the police. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third floor of a condominium not far away, behind a window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former curator Griman looked gloomy at the farm and whispered: "What the hell is going on!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After setting up the container, Glyman took the person back and saw the police surrounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another old man standing beside him whispered: "Jacks of the lurking polar institute was killed, stupid Morgan has no choice but to choose Reported."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grimman suddenly became a heavy face: "I said, I let them know some things, otherwise they don’t know anything. People, the easiest thing to do if they have any problems."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole circus is completely unaware of them, they only know that Grimman is a group of people. Sponsors and investors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are not believers, just a group of ordinary people who have been deceived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s time to stay with two people to monitor them." Griman looked confession. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the old man said faintly: "You should say that there are no two people to monitor them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "What do you mean? Ted?" Griman's face was unpleasant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man called Ted did not care, said faintly: "My manpower is not enough, you took four people to deal with the problem of the container. The rest The seven people are going to paint the array of sacrifices in the most secret place and time, and they also have to disguise. With such a huge workload, the seven of us are desperately trying to finish it last night, if two people are missing. It is absolutely impossible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And, for a group of people who don't touch mystery at all, do you think that leaving two people can really control the situation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Ted, Liman took a deep breath and calmed down and said, "Sorry, it was just my problem. The death of Nielsen brought me a lot of pressure."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;These twelve people are connected to each other through mystery and can sense each other's vitality at a certain distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fifty minutes ago, the vitality of the two people who stayed in the museum's aftermath completely disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don’t be impatient, this time has a huge risk in itself, but the problem is not big. Dealing with Nielsen’s two people should be the Archbishop’s coming. The man, Bart Inbas. He is like us, not afraid to appear. But don't forget, we still have the help of that one." Ted is much calmer than Griman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one mentioned, Glyman’s look flashed a little and nodded and said: “In today’s situation, I can only find the help of that one. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When talking, Glyman looked at the eyes outside the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong?" Ted asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregman raised his finger and pointed to the young man with the dog at the door of the farm. His face was dignified and said: "He has weird, huge weirdness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no stop here. Suge rushed to the farm. The first thing I saw was that Director Ossen took Jack to maintain order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong with you?" Orson was shocked when he saw Sugg's appearance and hurried over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge gasped hard and said: "I was attacked by mysterious people. The madness incident at the museum is a mysterious event. I have important information... Huh... I want to tell Master Geros."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, hearing this, Ossen was shocked and turned and said: "Jack! Helping Su Ge, let's go in. !"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
