			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas began the Pope’s journey, standing at the door of the temple and quickly issuing orders to Jean, Elena, Hills and others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Includes this investigation of the Church of the Holy Blood, including the alert of the mystery in the city, including the protection of the inhabitants and the security of the werewolf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The order was clear and orderly, and there were more than a dozen streets in Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger is not interested in standing there at this time, he is boring, he is walking in the fog with Walter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In getting the gift of Su Ge, at least in the dream, Father Water has two legs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have always been curious, what was your realm before?" The mundane and complicated things were pushed to Vanas, and Su Ge’s energy was all at this time. This world, and mysterious knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walt replied truthfully: "The lord, and has been stuck for almost twenty years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that, Father Water’s face showed a smile on his face: “Thanks to the precious power that God has given me, I feel that I have the opportunity to move on.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Can you tell me about the realm and the criteria above the master?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walter nodded with a smile: "Before speaking about the master, there are three levels that we can reach now. Lord, Dominator, Great Sage." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master is the limit of professional routine knowledge, such as the demon hunter, the master's logo is proficient in all conventional potions, the use of unconventional potions, A deep understanding of all the sects, monsters and other monsters. In simple terms, everyone in theory can become a master, because masters can continue to learn through conventional means."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"It's just that this study is very boring and uninteresting, and few people can afford it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge deeply agreed to nod: "Loneliness is the most tortured Human."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My profession is the late-time prisoner. It is the secret profession that my master has given me. I came to the expert level in the confusion, but I haven’t felt any improvement in the past six months. The master is still very far away."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walter smiled and explained: "You are well-deserved and have the gift of my Lord. It is naturally unfavorable in the early stage. You may not know for yourself, defeat the master with the body of the expert." It’s a shocking thing.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s eyes blinked, then he said awkwardly: “I’m not really sure. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before the master, it is a process of accumulation and learning. It is the process of laying a foundation for a certain knowledge path. You need to understand and integrate now. A lot of knowledge about your career should be able to enter the master class very quickly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no obvious difference in the mastery of knowledge between experts and masters, but In terms of mastery, there is a difference. For example, if you use a restraint, you have three. There are probably more than a dozen methods for the psionics to operate, and because of this, the masters have a very flexible way of fighting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Like Gerlos. He is a master. Sometimes he deals with some two-stage demon. He is easily injured and looks very weak. But he really uses all his methods. He can even kill any kind of Yi and monsters in the four stages. Because he has enough knowledge, he has mastered enough means."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge heard it all at once, suddenly and cheerfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walt reminded: "Of course, if you want to go a long way, try not to look at some of the knowledge left by others before the master, before arriving at the master." If you can comprehise your own knowledge about the profession, then after you reach the master level, it is relatively easy to enter the lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge thought: " Original things are more profound and more suitable for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walter The kindness and kindness nodded, and there was a trace of remembrance in the eyes: "I have met a man. He entered mystery at the age of 18 and became a swordsman. He abandoned all the things left by all the predecessors, all Everything is only groping by yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“He spent ten years, from the apprentice to the profession, and spent another twelve years from the profession to the expert, and then spent 18 years from the expert to the master.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Su Ge heard this very surprised, he spent more than half a year from apprentice to expert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walter said with a smile: "The second after arriving at the master On the fourth day of becoming a lord, he entered the dominator and spent three months directly entering the great sage!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;! ! ! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s incredible to hear this Sug’s eyes wide open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wall right color said: "This involves the secret of the master."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" prior to master learning and accumulation of knowledge, the knowledge accumulated after a certain point, we need to completely into their own things, so that my identity changed from looking for human use and knowledge can make knowledge activation, received human knowledge. This is the meaning of the two words of the lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Knowledge activation...Leadership knowledge..." Su Ge fell into meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walter continues: "The most intuitive sign is the self-awareness of knowledge and remote control of knowledge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "According to the Pope's intelligence, the investigator who came to Guinness called Laurie Burton. He is a lord-level shadow hunter. This profession can transform itself into the ability to capture darkness and darkness." And his iconic ability as the lord is to monitor your shadows in the palace now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Those black spots?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wo character head: "This kind of shadow allows the magic to move its position according to the environment and observe the position of the character, changing its own camouflage form. And by the master Practice, you can pass your conversations and even images to the host."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is to make the devil like a lord, to monitor the entire palace, and I can fully understand the internal situation through psionic contact."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge heard this and suddenly became clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So it’s up to you to accumulate. The knowledge that you have cultivated a little bit, driving it, is definitely better than the knowledge you receive from others. Right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, understand!" Su Ge nodded and suddenly felt another door open to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From the lord, to the dominator, is to continuously deepen and strengthen the knowledge, need more auxiliary knowledge to strengthen the core knowledge, let them from the farmer Become a soldier with great power. At this time, your knowledge is not just a connection and an order, but a domination."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dominance..." Su Ge Chew these two words carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dominance is absolute control, you can ignore the space, ignore the distance to control your knowledge, and even ignore the form and nature of knowledge, producing far beyond normal The form and change of human understanding."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For me, I can now use my knowledge to freeze the enemy's blood and kill the enemy. And enter the dominator." After that, I can change the shape of the blood in the enemy's body, even those that make the blood active, become blood monsters, or other things, as long as there is no order from me, they will continue, even if I am dead, these There is no change in things, and this is the absolute domination."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The dominator is the absolute dominance of knowledge."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge was generally clear, and then asked: "What about the great sage?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear these two Word, Walter’s eyes with a longing to say: “The Great Sage is a kind of knowledge. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s brow wrinkled and meditated: "That is, the sign of the Great Sage is based on known knowledge and advances toward the unknown." What is the unprecedented new knowledge system?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walt with a hint of praise: "It is the spokesperson of my Lord, and my ability to think is very good." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"People's knowledge is a circle, and outside the circle is an area unknown to humans. Ignorance is always horrible, so people will desperately expand their own The knowledge circle, however, as the circle increases, the circumference of the circle becomes larger and there are more unknowns."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The so-called great sage is to jump out of this circle and open up a new circle of great men in the endless unknown fear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug Contemplation: "The Great Sage can be said to be an unknown developer, just like the great Newton, Tesla, Galileo, Einstein, and the great knowledge that humans have not discovered. Only this kind of development has emerged. A person with a new knowledge system is qualified to be called a great sage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fog and the ghost are accompanied by the wandering in the Kingdom of God, and the huge wolf is on the side, The eyes opened slightly and looked at the two, so they turned over and went to sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two men walked silently for a while, and Su Ge asked, "What about the Sage?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Walt shook his head: "That has entered a new field, the new form is not something that we can understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Great God should be a level in that field?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walter indulged: "It can be understood that although the Great God is called the ultimate form of human beings, but no matter what level the Great God is in that field, no one is estimated. Know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As a mystery, it is too difficult. We strive to seek truth, but we have always been threatened by true knowledge. In the past history, we were killed by monsters and enemies. The mystery is far lower than the person who is on the road to knowing the madness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walth pauses: "I have seen a madness out of control. In an instant, the entire city was burned out, tens of thousands of people died, and the flame he left was burned in the ruins for fifty years, and it has not been extinguished yet."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s heart is a bit heavy: “You go to rest, I think about it myself.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wo features nodded, ready to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"French Walter?" Suddenly, an unexpected sound came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
