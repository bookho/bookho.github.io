			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;吱吱吱吱...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The harsh sound came from the cave, followed by a wave of wings The sound of the tapping sounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is standing calmly in the hole, his face is dull, his eyes are drooping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heavy bells don’t know where they came from, and they gradually spread in this area, and they will not be scattered for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗖嗖嗖! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a dozen small black shadows flew out of the hole like a Swift at a very fast speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of this speed, ordinary people can’t react completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Su Ge does not need to respond. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dozen blood bats that have just rushed out of the hole, exceeding the height of the Sog. The body is instantly torn by an invisible blade, or becomes two halves, or becomes four segments, with the blood falling in the air falling on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge looks as usual, and his hands are not in his pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the ability of today's professional-grade night-time prisoners to turn the sound of the late bell into a sharp-cut blade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the late bell of Su Ge has now covered the entire hole, and all the sound waves in the air have turned into sharp edges. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood bats that hit these sharp edges are naturally dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole process of flying out lasts for about a dozen seconds. After almost forty bats, a person’s fist size, full body blood red, full of clumsy blood bats slow Fly slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be because it stayed inside for too long, it has not been able to fly, and even touched the sound waves, and it fell to the ground with a bang. The body twitched a few times and died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge squatted with the wings of the big bat and looked up: "Well, it’s right after the bat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just in case, the bell is once again When it rings, the aftermath passes through the hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge closed his eyes and felt it carefully, then nodded: "Well, there is no living thing. This nest is clean."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Installing the bat with a special canvas bag as a proof of accomplishing the task, Su Ge turned his head and looked at the other direction and muttered: "So madman, you are now Where?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗷呜! Hey! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Erha screamed at the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, Suger heard a rush of wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, the long-trained body instinct rolls on the spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heavy landing sound came, Su Ge turned over and saw a whole body full of red hair, strong body, bloody eyes, dark The yellow teeth, the savage savage descended from the sky, staring at themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Old village chief! Say good offensiveness is not strong!" Su Ge said in his heart, the cane in his hand became a long sword form . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't be excited! I am not malicious!" Su Ge tried to appease. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While speaking, through the meditation of the priest, he wants to appease his violent heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The clergyman...must die!" The savage voice groaned in the mouth of the savage, and opened his arms and flew directly toward Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The savage's physical fitness is quite good, above Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the attack is very clumsy and has no rules. After a rigorous training, Suge calmly escapes his attack, turns back to a leg, trips him, and then Pounce on a pick and put him on the ground to completely subdue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The savage savage began to struggle desperately, struggling while yelling: "Kill! Kill you! Kill the clergy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The savage is very powerful, There seems to be no pain in the nerves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger through the joint technique heard a squeaky bone rubbing sound, the struggling savage disregarded his joint deformation and dislocation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This guy!" Su Ge’s heart was secretly scared, and he hurriedly grabbed his head, letting the two look at each other, then quietly whispering and using hypnosis while using I want to calm him down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, let Su Ge try his best and the two strokes are completely ineffective at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the prayers of the "Month of the Moon" in Su Gezui, the savage suddenly feels like a huge stimulus, becoming more arrogant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, the situation that shocked Su Ge appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Roll! You are a despicable running dog!" With the scream of the savage, his body burst into a very powerful psionic power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This psionic power is very strong, at least at the master level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge instantly felt his body hit by a carriage, and suddenly flew out and crashed into the trunk behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;噗! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge spit a blood, feeling a chest tightness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is my luck so back?" Su Ge was pale and ugly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A savage who has never "actively attacked others", not only attacking himself madly, but even a mysterious person who is at least a master? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What kind of luck is this his mother? Every day, the goddess can make me lucky, and I don’t use it at the end." Su Ge was very annoyed at this time. Continuously bursting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The savage here stands up, and the look is even more crazy. The horrible spirit can be brewed on his body: "Kill you! Kill you! Kill all the clergy! Kill these monsters!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the end, the savage rushed toward Su Ge with a horrible momentum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug took a deep breath, and the night clock in his mind rang three times in a row. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, the dense sound waves spread out to form the psionic edge of hundreds of cutting psionics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "First solve the problem of psionic suppression, distract him from his attention, then turn and run. The next time you are doing this, the situation is unknown, not sure , I am a dog!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure enough, with the sound of the late bell, the rushing savage body suddenly froze, as if it was shocked by something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg saw these words without saying anything, and turned around and ran away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment when Su Ge is about to rush out...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Young, sorry." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, one was full of exhaustion and apology, and some old voices came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this sound, Sugton stunned and turned my head carefully, and found that the crazy savage was quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time he was calm and peaceful, and the madness and chaos in his eyes retreated, filled with the wise wisdom of the years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the madman who had just eaten a man turned into a temperamental and wise man with a temperament. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey? Hey?" Su Ge’s eyes widened and he was completely stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The savage looked down at his hands with red hair at this moment, whispering: "Sure enough, I can't escape this curse."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, the savage looked up and carefully looked at Su Ge and smiled awkwardly: "Thank you for the bell, just suppress my animality."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
