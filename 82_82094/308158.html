			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger stood by and looked at the three people who were deadlocked, and quickly returned to God to carefully look at the costumes and looks of the three people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The woman in the red dress said that the little assassin, then there is no accident that the black youth is the Assassin League, with such a huge fire spell, the dead one The woman should be a dragon flame believer. This enchanting red woman can control the blood. In light of the current situation, she should be a twin-minded person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "The last cowboy, although the attire is very common, but the pistol is surrounded by a strong aura of death, it should be the core combatant of the death sect."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Suge's body does not have knowledge about death, but after the last experience of the gods, he has a certain ability to perceive the atmosphere of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After three people confronted each other for about ten seconds, the cowboy took the lead and attacked the hook and fired a bullet directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment of launch, Su Ge suddenly discovered that it was not an ordinary bullet, but a human finger! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red woman here crushes a bottle in an instant, and the contents of the bottle are bright red blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These bloods form a shield under her control, silently blocking the finger bullets, while her body is holding a long red dress, showing the length of the white The legs rushed toward the black youth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hand with blood red nails pinches forward, the blood of the woman’s body on the ground is controlled, and climbs up the legs of the youth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young people are not naturally vegetarian. They took a dark grenades from their waists and threw them forward, and then whistled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰砰砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three gunshots came from far away, and the precision hit the youth around the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bullet seems to have a special psionic power and runes, quickly disintegrating the imprisonment of the blood, and the youth who pulled out their feet turned and ran, while the grenade instantly detonated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge impact force with a large amount of silver ash powder formed a huge forbidden space, the scattered silver ash powder not only interfered with the woman's breathing, but even interfered with her psionic rotation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn at the moment!" The woman used her sleeves to smack her mouth and snorted quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cowboy here does not say anything, suddenly rushed to the assassin to chase. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole process, the three people regarded Su Ge as a scared ordinary person, and did not even look at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle was very fast, the pace was very fast, and the whole process did not exceed a dozen seconds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although this speed is the same as that of Bart, but..." Su Ge looked at the bullet marks and the newly exploded grenade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the end, is this group of guys unruly, or is Bart's guy too antique to keep up with the pace of the times?" Su Ge had some tangles in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first Bart was very confident and self-righteous to tell himself a whole lot about mysterious battles and rules. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result is down the road, and the pile of things that I said at the beginning did not follow a few. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the entanglement, Su Ge slightly opened the collar and looked at his own moon, Fulan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, it should be that Bart is too antique, can't keep up with the times." Su Ge came to a conclusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When necessary, Su Ge would not hesitate to pull out the gun to blow the enemy's dog's head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bypassing the banned area blocked by silver ash, Su Ge came to the dead woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman looks like she is about forty years old, but she looks much younger than her age and is estimated to be the reason for her long practice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now arrange her soul!" Su Ge is preparing to pray for this woman and purify her soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This little brother doesn't seem to be an ordinary person!" Some of the horrible voices suddenly sounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge looks as usual, slowly turns his head and looks at it. I don’t know when the woman has returned, standing two meters behind Su Ge, holding her hands The chest hits Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close up, Su Ge found that the woman did not wear the same as she imagined, her upper body is similar to the lace collar of the dress, the chest is similar to the suit Just as neat buttons, don't talk about the chest, you can't see your neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The skirt below is very large, but it can occasionally see the legs, and looks very dignified at close range. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have always believed that the Gemini Alliance is the kind of crazy believer wearing a red robe and a mask. I saw you this year, which really opened my eyes. Su Ge calmly responded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman’s eyes are not big, it belongs to the kind of Danfengyan, very god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After looking at Su Ge, the woman smiled and said suddenly: "I just let the waste look up 7 points, go crazy directly?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyebrows under Su Ge’s hat were picked up with a smile on his lips and asked: “You and I don’t seem to meet each other?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Raul said a bit about your appearance and temperament, good at Lenovo painting portrait map is the basis of the mysterious." The woman blew her blood red nails, casually said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug slightly pinched the cane, while the body stepped back, the blood away from the ground asked: "So what are your plans now?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am more curious about who you are, why the forces work." The woman looked up, and the blood-red pupil was staring at Su Ge like a pair of sharp edges. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge bluntly said: "I belong to the church of the late bell, you can call me a clockman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hearing this name, the woman’s brow wrinkles seems to be in meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh! Right! After two days, the Marquis of Raul will host a nobility party?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
