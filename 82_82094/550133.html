			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The undead Ryan is indeed very strong. Under his leadership, the entire new coalition is in a state of nowhere, and there is no suspicious institution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have already entered the inner city at this time, a total of almost 500 people, the mighty direct rush to the core of the whole problem: the palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg did not follow them at this time, he and Randall have high mobility, and the two have already arrived at the edge of the palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire palace is a small city surrounded by towering walls with lots of buildings, like the stars, the towering magnificence, the pyramids The shape of the ancient emperor is in the middle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people stood at the top of a five-story house and observed the situation in the Imperial City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interior of the entire Imperial City is still calm, but there are a large number of giant guards covered with scale armor, armed with spears, long swords, and big axes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people are very powerful, obviously after that kind of variability, there is still a horrible existence of consciousness and knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Randall looked at the thousands of monsters outside the palace, and he said with some excitement: "Adult, if all of these people are dead, do I have The opportunity is coming again?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last time, all the first members of the church witnessed the great form of the Lord in the world, but he was in the bloody Not seen in the pool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes him extremely regrettable and remorseful, like a poor man, lost a lottery worth more than one billion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge shook his head: "The conditions are not available."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Randall finished Suddenly regretted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The key to my Lord’s coming is the soul that has lost life on a large scale. Although many people have died here, these souls cannot leave the city and will be souls. The Grail absorbs instantly. Losing these souls as anchors for traction, my Lord cannot come here accurately from another world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Randall’s face was clear when he heard it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge continued: "And, my Lord and I said that the current law of the world is not suitable for the deities of God, and it is easy to cause the collapse of the world. Another core that can come is because the laws of the world inside Bain have collapsed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to these, Landerton’s spirit was shocking, obviously I feel that I know more about the real situation in the world today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the two conversations, the human allied forces have come outside the imperial city and have had fierce battles with those monsters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result of the battle is the same as that expected by Su Ge. Those monsters are terrifying and dangerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when people grasp their weaknesses and figure out their attacking methods and rhythms, these unwise mutant monsters are the lowest level of soldiers, killing It looks like a mowing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's more, the one who leads today is the undead Ryan. The knowledge he has is terrible. He seems to have a complete understanding of the Byron Dias. All the secrets, I have never seen them, but I know them all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of those monsters, the entire coalition under his wisdom is like a sharp knife piercing into the tofu, sweeping all the obstacles in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s not a helper to ask the Holy Father to come, it can be said to be a turn of the tide." Su Ge said with a satisfied face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Randall asks: "Is it so rushing in? Will it affect our plans?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looked at the palace and said: "This is just an appetizer. She hasn’t shot yet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug is completely unfeelable What level is Sherry? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His original calculation, Shirley is likely to be the embodiment of the Mori Black Goat in the human world, even the Holy Father and Ryan have put this theory on the ground. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But last night Ada’s words completely subverted the previous situation, and Ada would never lie to him. He was convinced at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since it will not lie, it means that he and the Holy Father are wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next battle is fierce, but there is no suspense, or even a unilateral massacre. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of a completely united coalition, those monsters have no ability to resist, and in less than half an hour, they are completely killed by the coalition forces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the last monster falling to the ground, the gates of the Great Emperor City slowly opened, seemingly welcoming them to enter the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can't get in?" Lao said with a respectful turn and asked the Holy Father. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Father nodded slightly: "Since you are welcome, go in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lauri After listening to it, with a big hand, the entire coalition immediately opened into the palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the perspective of Su Ge, along with the coalition process, the powerful and powerful guards in the city began to assemble quickly, under the leadership of the ten ghost figures. Waiting in the big square in front of the palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Lord is going to appear, let's go, we also enter the Imperial City."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, two people flew from above to the Imperial City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the steps of the palace hall, the four-meter-tall giant walked out with five-eyed hunters and looked at the Holy See that had entered the gate in the distance. The person asked: "When did she start?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five-eyed hunter replied: "When they are completely into the city, the darkness will cover the entire city, then, the darkness The gift of the goddess of the rich will come."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant emperor nodded slightly and suddenly asked: "I don't understand why you are doing it with her." Together?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five-eyed hunter faintly replied: "This is my Lord's command, not you and I can speculate."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant emperor flashed a sneer in his heart: "A broken god, it can really survive. When I master the soul holy grail and become a real god, then you will not be worth mentioning." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, everyone in the coalition has entered the Imperial City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two people who just flew to the wall suddenly accepted the message of Gerlos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The good play has just begun." After listening to the news of Gerlos through the seal, Su Ge's eyes flashed in the eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Randall asked curiously, "What's wrong, adult?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looked The Imperial City asked: "Do you remember those people who got the secret treasure from here and then fled?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well." Randall nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those people can be said to be one of the sources of the expansion of the entire ancient city time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug continued: "They are all back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Back? What? ?" Randall sneaked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge said faintly: "You will know soon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imperial City In this case, the two sides confronted each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Father and Ryan took the three archbishops forward and looked at the giants in the distance and said calmly: "Give up resistance, you don't know what you are." What kind of monsters are helping."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Giant Emperor calmly replied: "Accurately, you don't know how majestic plans you are blocking."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Byron Dias people have long since disappeared in the long river of history. You are the survivors of the past. In March, the church did not pay you back. You should feel grateful. The Holy Word said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant listened to the flesh-wings behind them and slowly began to look at them and said: "The glory of March has covered the world for too long, it is time Some changes should be made."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So you want to rely on the monster that tries to destroy the world to help you rule the world!?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant replied calmly: "Intellect is the shackles of the spirit, and madness is the premise of freedom. The world has been completely corrupted, and only a big shatter can be exchanged for a new life. You are not qualified to be degraded by blood. Continue to live."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ryan said at the moment: "Now is the time to clean up the garbage, let's get started!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, I don’t know where to take out a long sword about one meter long and make a big step forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant looked down at Ryan, and there was a deep disgust in his eyes: "Why are you so despicable guys still dead?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lane smiled hoarsely: "I want to die, can you help me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, The battle broke out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who wear scales, armed with weapons, and the general guards and defensive powers of the two-fourth body are more than one grade higher than the Holy Swords. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just one face-to-face, more than twenty members of the Holy Sword team were directly killed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s okay, there are so many masters here, the Holy Words directly shot, and several batches of blessings have raised the combat power of the Holy Swords to a whole new level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the tall warriors, there are ten phantoms and thirty hunters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these ten horror phantoms, people still have no way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Ryan has. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Ryan pinched his long sword and put a black thing into his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, his body suddenly appeared a lot of fiery red cracks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These cracks are like wounds that flow out of magma on the body of a lava monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crack quickly filled his body, and the next few seconds of fire whistling, he directly became a whole body burning with a hot flame, the whole body exuded horror The power of deterrence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this form, he snorted and spit out a large black smoke in his mouth, and his body appeared in front of a ghost with a string of fiery red figures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghost hasn’t felt the threat yet, and he’s grabbing Ryan’s head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, however, Ryan’s long sword has already burned a horrible flame and waved it down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a terrible scream, this ghost is burning like a lit paper in the moment of being cut by a fire sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, ten seconds, in the fierce struggle of the ghost, turned into a blackened ember. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is actually a form of fire." The Emperor of the Giants was well informed and saw that his face was a bit gloomy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why don’t the dead die, it’s always a mystery, and the giant is not clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he knows something about the undead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the important ones is the state of the undead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For some reason, every undead body contains horrible heat and strange flames. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And some undead people can grasp this heat and flame after reaching a certain level, and pull it out of the body to reach a new form. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If this morphological ability is not clear, he knows that this form of burning self counts as a kind of higher creature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Ryan can reach his son. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This form is a natural enemy of those ghosts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lyan’s body was trained in countless swift backstabs, and there’s no trace of it. It’s very fast and kills instantly. Four ghosts died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
