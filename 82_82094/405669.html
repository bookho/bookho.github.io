			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s obvious that Charlie has heard a lot of rumors about witches since he was a child. After hearing the words of Su Ge, his face is even more fearful and hurried. Say: "Sir, let's go! The monsters that the witch becomes are the incarnations of the demons. They can easily destroy the entire city and kill countless residents. We must inform the church quickly!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge gave him a glance and asked calmly: "Who told you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I...my mom." Charlie was suddenly narrowed down by Su Ge’s eyes, and he instinctively told the truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What did your mother do?" Su Ge stepped forward and stopped in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My mom is a baker..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Children, some things need themselves Witness can prove the authenticity, don't listen to the story, and pass on the rumor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge Pinghe’s voice just fell, and it sounded like a beast to scream through the block. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the screaming, it was the blood-red claw that was so distorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr.!" Charlie, standing behind, saw this hurriedly yelling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touch! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The claws that stretched out were suddenly blocked by invisible barriers when they were one meter away from Su Ge, as if they were caught in the wall, they could not move forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At this time..." Charlie saw this, his incredible eyes wide open, and he was in the same place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is taking a step forward, hehe! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the fall of this step, the invisible sound waves came from his body. Under Charlie’s gaze, the body of the terrible monster seemed to suddenly The same was cut by countless sharp edges, and the twisted body was instantly split into six or seven. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The claws fell, the extended thighs fell, and even the head was cut. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monster suddenly squats on the ground, as if he is dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We have succeeded!?" Charlie looked up and looked at the temptation of the back of Su Gewei. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sugg suddenly slammed his cane and suddenly opened it into a silver umbrella. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;噗嗤...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monster’s wound suddenly spurted a pale yellow pus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This pus is sprayed like a high-pressure water pistol, actually directly penetrated the late bell of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the material of the umbrella is special. This pus spray does not have any effect. It descends along the umbrella surface and instantly corrodes the ground to a full thirty. A deep pit with a centimeter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What a ghost thing!" Charlie shivered and his eyes widened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪嗒! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lingsight has risen a bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Close your eyes, child, if you don't want to go crazy." The Sug umbrella that went to it instantly turned into a two-meter long silver pistol. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hands licking Charlie's collar, the body lightly receded three or four meters, and opened the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Charlie was asked to return, and quickly closed his eyes and asked: "Sir, are you... mysterious?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Su Ge said shortly, stepping back and arching his body, his arms were pinched and the whole body was taut and ready to throw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, the monster body has changed again about six meters away from Su Ge, and the cut body tissue has extended countless tentacles and reconnected behind the body. Every organ actually turned into a disgusting piece of meat with a mouth full. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“This has transcended the biological form and turned into a more advanced life system. But because of the loss of the inherent rules of qualification, it has become like this. The conventional means cannot kill it at all, because human means touch There is no such thing as "death" of advanced life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But!" Su Ge flashed two flames in his eyes: "I can!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you want to finish, the arm muscles are squirming, and a long shot, like a silver streamer, shoots out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost this moment, this rifle is like ignoring the space, and instantly comes to the front of the monster, penetrating its body from an angle of about sixty degrees from the elevation angle. Then nail it directly to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horrible cold erupted along the rifle, and under the urging of Su Ge Ling, the struggling monster became a less than five seconds. Silver ice sculpture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Charlie with his eyes closed only felt a bit of chill, and then the clutter stopped and the whole world fell into silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Have you succeeded?" Charlie tempted and still dared not blink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug did not answer, staring at the ice sculpture, sure that the things here will not continue to move and split, carefully approached. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feeling the proximity of Su Ge, the monster suddenly reacted, and there are signs of breaking away from hoarfrost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge's face is dignified, his hands are directly pressed on the ice, and a lot of spirits can pour out, whispering and whispering his original Prayer words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the introduction of the mysterious and mysterious power of the prayer, this monster seems to have heard the demon of the Bible, suddenly wilting after a violent convulsion, motionless . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this Su Ge spit out, this time the monster is "dead." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Su Ge sees the figuration of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of death figuration is the basis of Su Ge's knowledge, but the figuration of seeing is indescribable. This kind of thing is invisible. But as long as there is death, he can feel it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The finger was slightly moving, and the long gun flew back into his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means of controlling the Great God's Declaration is the only legacy left by the power of the gods - greatly increasing his mastery and connection to the Great God's Declaration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are still many limitations to this control. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, he can only control the form of the big gun in the form of a long gun, the distance of the remote control is only within three meters, and relatively consumes psionic power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ice is gradually broken, and the distorted body has completely lost its activity. Like a leaky balloon, the whole body quickly dried up and swollen under the eyes of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in a dozen seconds, all the extra muscles were organized into fine dust, dissipated, leaving only a woman with a broken body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge squatted down and looked at the corpse that was no longer the same. He had all his heart and heart, and he didn’t know what to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a bullet was suddenly hit and blocked by the late bell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge turned his head and saw a uniformed scepter who led two fully armed exorcists to look at themselves This hunting demon bullet is played by the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are you!?" The sinner is a blond youth about thirty-five years old, and his face is dignified. Asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just, they rushed over when they heard the mutated monsters on their daily patrols, but when they arrived at the scene, they found that the whole body was full of mystery. The youthful look calmly looked down at the body of the broken woman on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That moment made him think that this panic was caused by this young man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called monster does not, it is likely to be the illusion used by this youth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the side, Charlie heard the voice of the sinner, opened his eyes and saw the monster disappeared and immediately explained: "Dr. Dunn! Don't misunderstand! This gentleman is a good man, and his ability to use it to stabilize the people around him, I also wiped out the distorted monster."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gods who called Dunn listened to a glimpse, first looked at the pale-character Charlie, confirmed Charlie turned to look at Su Ge at this time and asked: "I am not malicious, but please show your identity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge Take out the token that you carry with you: "The Holy Blood Church Guinness Regional Bishop, Suger Sotos."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ha!?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard Su Ge’s words, Charlie was completely stunned and could not return to God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twen is also a bit aggressive at this time, the temptation is close, carefully look at the token in Su Ge’s hand, and repeatedly confirm that this thing is true and suddenly his face is very Panic, hurriedly bowed to the ceremony: "Bishop Sotos! Sorry! I am sorry! I just got a little nervous, I..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exorcist at this time Oh, no return to God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This came out of a mysterious incident and met the bishop? What is the probability? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug collects the token and swings freely: "Nothing, you just judged it is not wrong, get up!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard the calm words of Su Ge, Dunn’s heart was slightly peace of mind, and he got up and tempted and asked: “How did you suddenly return to Bain City? I have no other meaning, just...”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twen is nervous at this time and does not know how to explain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just shot a shot at the legendary bishop of the church, but it was blocked by the bishop’s psionic shield. If it’s really hit, then I am afraid that I am not guilty of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Archbishop needs." Su Ge briefly explained, looked at three people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three people are professional, standing and posture is still capable, should be a veteran. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
