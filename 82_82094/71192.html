			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When thinking about it, Su Ge swept his eyes around the temple to find some clues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The ground is normal, the walls are normal, the clock tower is normal, etc. What is it?" At the end of the line of sight, Su Ge fell on the dome of the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dome of the entire temple is made up of twelve giant wings that extend from the throne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless exquisite reliefs on this line, including wolves, undead, warriors, war horses, and the first nameless s King. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no brilliance relief, and Su Ge could now see a little starlight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These stars are ice blue, divided into two areas, for a total of sixteen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourteen regions are located in the undead, and the light is slightly dim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining two rays are bright and are located in the wolf group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vision of God swept forward and everything was clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These stars represent the source of faith for my people and my followers, the link between them and me. The stronger the light, the power of faith. The stronger the fourteen faint stars represent Chuck, Pamela and others who have died and have been overtaken by me. Because they are dead, in the undead, not in the form of human beings, thus providing the power of faith. Slightly weak."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The remaining two represent Hills and Bernice. They are real humans, so the beliefs provided are more pure and honest. They are located in the wolves, then this disguise indicates that the wolves are my people and believers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Su Ge has thought of Ways. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood up and waved, holding the two blue stars above the dome in his hands and stepping out of the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the deck full of frost, to the front of the ship, vacated, accompanied by a cold wind, sitting in front of the giant wolf On the back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The palm of the hand stroked the windy hair of the giant Erha and looked around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, we can see that these dreams are not stable, some are constantly expanding, some are shrinking, and many are changing because of various wishes and subconsciousness. It is similar to the weird shape just. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Looking at the past!" Su Ge patted the back of the giant Erha, faintly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗷呜呜...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a wolverine, the giant wolf jumped up, Feet chill on the feet and rush in the space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Guardian!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the giant wolf's gallop, the fourteen warriors on the battleship Jumping down, sitting on other ghost wolves, then like fourteen blue meteors, holding the long ghost light behind Su Ge, roaring in this world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge slightly sideways, looking at the wolf cavalry behind him through the mask, a look of satisfaction, such a guard is really handsome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole space doesn't seem to be big. Su Ge rode the giant wolf and led the knight to fly for a while before the gray wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After all, I have to test it, just touch it." Su Ge thought, reaching out and gently touching the gray wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, countless incomparable thoughts poured into his head like a tide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intimidated him to take back his hand in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a broad vision and a high level of thinking. But the thinking is too distorted and messy. These are all the things that people see in their dreams. Countless twisted dreams are pouring into the mind of Su Ge as real. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With my current body, although I can swim in this, I can’t be a human being. Even in a dream, it’s a little out of here. A lot of information will blow up my real-world head."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Su Ge looked down at the two blue stars in his hand and closed his eyes to counter-call through his control of the dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of dreams is driven by the source of two beliefs. Su Ge quickly found the world of Hills and Bernice in this dream world. Dreamland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the dreams of the two people are very simple and simple, showing a flat and rounded oval shape, and even a little cute in Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will not enter their dreams first, let them come to this battleship through this." Su Ge thought, using his power, start to act. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the real world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hills and Bernice are huddled together and sleep peacefully, and their mouths are smashed from time to time, seemingly eating something good in their dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the two people gradually appeared some pale blue aura, gradually wrapping the bodies of two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, the two invisible souls were rolled up by the aura and disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hills and Bernice felt that they had a dream, they dreamed of riding a storm, crossing a gray world, then appearing in On an icy battleship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long and thick bells rang, and the two men blinked and slowly returned to God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at each other and gradually discovering that this does not seem to be a dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magnificent battleship, the sacred temple, the thick bells, and the guards of the fourteen gods in front of the temple, everything is incomparable Real. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When two people were stunned, fourteen escorts came out with a female warrior dressed in tight-fitting, heavy body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are Hills and Bernice?" The female soldier’s voice was low, and she spoke with a bit of chill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
