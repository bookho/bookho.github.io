			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When two people were happy to fish, a young man hurriedly ran from a distance, panting, looking at Su Ge with a worried look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man turned his head slightly and looked at the young man who stood on the side and looked anxious and dared not to rush. The temptation asked: "Come to you?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug turned his head and looked at it, just in time for Kasna’s worried eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well." Su Ge nodded and waved at Kas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cass hurried over and whispered, "Adult, it’s dangerous."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge’s expression was calm and calm, and he said slowly: “Slowly, don’t worry.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cass looked at Su Ge’s unhurried appearance. Anxiously full of sweat, I can't wait to pick up Su Ge and run. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Adult, there have been at least a dozen clerics in the vicinity, we have to leave here as soon as possible." Kass said seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man’s ear is very easy to use. When he hears this, the eyelid eyes glance at the calm and calm Su Ge and suddenly ask: “You are a cultist "?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge raised his hand to appease the anxious Cass, turned his head and smiled at the old man and asked, "I am like?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Don't want to." The old man shook his head honestly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why can you see?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If the cults are as slow as you are, It won't bother the church." The old man said something very simple and unpretentious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sughaha smiled: "It is such a truth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man aimed at Kas At a glance: "Your man is like a cultist."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then you are not afraid!?" Kas pretended to be a fierce blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man shrugged and said nothing: "I am eighty-one this year, and I am living in society. It is the goddess to live more every day." My gift is a gift for me. It is good to live, and I am not afraid to live. Anyway, I have earned a lot compared with other old men."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Su Ge re-sitting on the chair and smiled and said: "Although this mentality is very good, but you need to clear it, this extra life has nothing to do with the goddess. This is the result of your self-discipline, this is you "You should get it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man smiled and opened his mouth and said: "You really are cultists."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you mean!?" Hearing this, Kas brows his head and his face is angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this old thing dementia? Can't hear the adult, is he boasting about him? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug is very calm and looks at the fish on the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man grinned and said: "Your theory is exactly the opposite of the theory of the March church. No wonder they will pass you like a good old man."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cass listened to this, suddenly his face was reddish and awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge looked at the clerics and police officers who had increased on the other side of the river and said calmly: "You said, what is justice? It is the right thing." , or is it recognized by universal values?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This old question can't be understood by this old man. But justice should be the same as time itself. , itself is full of uncertainty." The old man said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge also heard this theory for the first time, curiously asked: "How do you say this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The old man holds the fishing rod firmly in his hands and says, "My grandfather, my father, I am a watchmaker, so we are very sensitive to time. At the beginning, I followed my father in the city during summer time and winter time. The time of all the big clocks in the city is adjusted. In the process of adjustment, I found that there is no standard in time. We adjust two points, that is, two points, three points are three points. People will not correct these, only follow This time continues to let go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The same is true of justice. This thing is relative. It is a person who has been bitten by a lion. We killed the lion and extended justice. But for the lion, it is the greatest injustice. Because of him. The bitten person walked into his territory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The same is true between humans."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The old man said, looking down at the fish in his hand and said: "My son is also a watchmaker. Because of an unintentional mistake, he misplaced the time of the watch, causing two workers in the factory to die, angry. When the people questioned my son, they missed him and pushed him down the stairs. Now he is at home. Although he still maintains his livelihood, he can no longer stand up. The two workers who lost him and were pushed down have been sentenced, and their families are broken. Losing financial support, the children went to the underground casino for a bite to eat, and when they finally hit the group, they died. His mother was mad and mad..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heard This Su Ge is silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In this chain reaction, no one is dark inside, and no one has a heart. Who is justice?" The old man said, That repaired countless clocks and steady big hands, creating a trembling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trembling through the surimi to the river, causing a circle of ripples, like the aftermath of the night before Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug can't answer this question because this series of hate cycles can't be solved at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some things are doomed not by conventional law and by what justice can solve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listening to these words, Kas was also in silence, not knowing what to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge calmly looked at the ripples on the water and said: "There is no way people can understand each other, and between people and other species. The inner barrier is The origin of the dispute. If everything is in one, if everything can understand each other and break the barriers of the heart, then you can see what is true justice at that time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp When I heard this, the old man smiled and said: "If this is the case, there is no privacy between people. Is the person at that time still a human?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge stunned and followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why people are called people is because of the existence of the wall of each person, the independent thinking individual carries his own secret, so that it will be normal. Become a person with a complex personality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s true that Su Ge just talked about the loss of barriers between people to achieve mutual understanding, perhaps it will be a disaster at that time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge understood this truth, he found that he could not refute, only silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few seconds later, the old man laughed and said: "These things are not something that my little person can solve. We naturally can't think about these things. It’s the most important thing to be happy to live your life.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge looked up at the relaxed old man and smiled: “Yes, think about these The thing itself has no meaning. The so-called human being is called a human being, and nature is the contradiction of this kind of contradiction between the advantages and the bad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They insist on themselves The justice that is done, the heart is longing for the good, but the bad things are carried out. In the mud, the heart is pure and innocent under the steadfast belief."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Speaking, Su Ge stood up and looked behind him: "I respect them rationally and understand them. Unfortunately, I am not a rational creature, so I think that they will be filthy sooner or later. Erosion, the pure heart will also rot."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When talking, Su Ge’s eyes just saw Laurie walking down the road with a priesthood and heading towards it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man who is fishing turned his head and looked at it. When he saw the exquisite archbishop’s robe in Laurie’s body, the eyes of the white flower could not help but twitch. a bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the Archbishop, the Archbishop of the Holy Blood Church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the eyelids trembled, the old man swept around and found that the old man who had been fishing around had disappeared, even the pedestrians on both sides of the street were Emptyed, replaced by dozens of heavily armed police and clergy, the total number of encirclement exceeded three digits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three people left by the big river. Even if the old man is a bachelor, his heart is a little weak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up and saw Su Ge, who had already stood up. This young man who was not old and premature was still calm at this time, but his deep eyes were not sharp, only Calm and soft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is really a big man." The old man’s fishing rod was a little trembling, and Su Ge’s influence seemed to be beyond his imagination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Laurie walked over with a few mysterious people dressed in quirky clothes, faintly forming a corner that would surround Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cass stepped forward to stop Sug. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Laurie glanced at Cass, his eyes flashing with cold eyes: "The traitors are really piles up, Kas Panko." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He naturally knows Kas, as a prisoner who was once held in the dungeon, the Church of the Holy Blood has a strict archive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of the Bain City incident, ten prisoners couldn’t see anyone, and they couldn’t see the dead. They reported that they were swallowed up by the monsters, but the ruling did not believe it, so There is no revocation of the file. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, those who can be held in the dungeons are those who are exposed to the taboos of the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cass calmly replied: "I am honored to meet you and become the Archbishop Laurie of the Shadow Hound."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Laurie chills and replies: "It is my pleasure to be a hound of the goddess."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Since it is a goddess hound, don't go 啃Those bones, what are you doing here? Is ruin a star of hope?" Kass’ strong counterattack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Our salvation is in our own hands and has nothing to do with you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Raise his hands and the people wearing the eccentric robes are raising their hands and getting closer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What Su Ge has experienced is too strange, even now, Laurie is still full of vigilance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yu Wei of the Storm Emperor, after so long time, is still deeply imprinted in the depths of his memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Adult, you are careful." Kas was full of strength, holding Su Ge behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge stepped forward and reached out to indicate that Cass had retired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cass naturally does not dare to violate the meaning of Su Ge, although he is still respectful and pushed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man looked at the respectful Kas and looked at Su Ge again. He suddenly found that he could not see the young man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge and Laurie stopped one meter apart and looked at each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no hurry on both sides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lauri is winning the prize at this time, he hopes that Su Ge can yield more docilely, so as to avoid other problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is a little scary, as if everything is not related to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The last time you looked at me, it should be in the base camp of the church coalition." Su Ge said calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no expression in the answer: "That incident was the beginning of the biggest shame in my life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "There is a humiliation, it is self-deprecating, these four words are suitable for you," Su Ge said faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We can't tolerate a child with such critical knowledge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is too lazy He made a so-called righteous sophistry. He bluntly said: "If these people are, you are not qualified to bring me back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"An ordinary person only Is it a bit too arrogant!?" The middle-aged bishop on the side heard this face unhappy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug did not go to see the bishop, looking at Laurie with deep eyes: "Mystery dissipated, knowledge collapsed, I am now just a disabled body. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laurie did not speak, Su Ge continued: "This should be my weakest time, but unfortunately, it is also my strongest time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am very clean and clean so that the gods are satisfied with it." Su Ge opened his arms and seemed to be showing everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Laurie’s eyes appeared cautious, and the body faintly retreated a small step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole process of Myra’s work is clear to him, and he understands what Su Ge means today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug continued: "Do you really think that my ultimate means is the Storm Emperor?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Speaking, Su Ge’s body suddenly has an unclear and unclear strange situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not a breath, it’s not a wave, it’s a situation, or a phenomenon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The mystery dissipates, the knowledge is over, and the vision is zero. It does not mean that the cause and effect of my body disappears."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge looked at Laurie with a condescending look: "What is this cause and effect? ​​You should be very clear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a moment, Laurie's face turned pale, and the forehead oozes a lot of fine sweat, and his looks are extremely dignified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man sitting there saw that it was completely stupid. He didn’t think that this young man who seemed to lose some could actually be like this in the future. Wolverine look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bern City, returning to the city, the ancient city, and then to the king of yellow clothes last night? Why can I be dangerous every time, laughing Finally? You really didn't study it carefully. What kind of existence is behind me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Larry heard this and felt helpless inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They haven’t studied it, but they have no clues and information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord of Storm and Death? Dream master? Death dominator? These titles have not been found in history. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
