			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two eyes and four eyes. Su Ge clearly saw the shock and excitement in Vanas’ eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary standing next to Su Ge noticed the eyes that had never been seen before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened? What happened?" Mary couldn't understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello?" Seeing Vanas swearing that God does not speak, Irina tempted a reminder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s respectful salute at this time: “Sug Sotos, seeing Her Majesty the Queen. Your style has long been heard, and today’s seeing is like a month. The silver glory makes people feel awe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas is the head of a country after all, and quickly returns to God and smiles and says: "Thank you for your praise, Mr. Toth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, Vanas turned and said to Prince Sacco: "I will seriously consider your proposal, I still have some things. I need to talk to my chief of staff, please come back!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sacco Prince looked at Elena and Su Ge’s eyes flashed a raging anger, then Stand up and smile: "I want to remind you that there is not much time for you to think. Please cherish this opportunity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, Turned around and left with a cold face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When passing by Su Ge, I still whispered: "It’s disgusting to be in this room with this low-lying scary person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sound is not small, everyone has heard it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas ignited a raging anger in his eyes, his face was gloomy and he was about to speak, but he was stopped by Su Ge’s eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas thinks that this is the Pope’s majesty, the incarnation of the human world! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have a chance to see the Pope’s opportunity to show strength?" Vanas was excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge’s eyes swept a glimpse of Prince Sacco and did not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sacco Prince sneered a sneer, ready to leave, and suddenly opened his mouth and shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Prince Sacco is like crazy, with his hands on his head, his expression twisted and uttered a harsh scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Protect Your Majesty!" In an instant, a dozen guards rushed in to vent the protection of Vanas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s hand with a cane, calmly took off the hat and said: “Looking out, the prince’s mental state is not very good, facing such a beautiful and noble Queen, how could it be so horrible!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the two servants of Prince Saku hurried forward to support their master, and hurriedly asked: "Prince! Prince! What happened to you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas turned to look at the two middle-aged people who were not very good-looking: "The two marquis, you are the Saco If the prince brought it, please take him back to heal as soon as possible, so he is really a bit ruined."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to this, Vanas is cold: "Please choose the right person when you choose the next time. Do you want your queen to marry a madman?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is disrespectful! Elena said with a deep face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, the marquis of the two old scorpions ooze a layer of fine sweat. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "!! Your Majesty sorry This is our negligence, we immediately deal with what Prince Nicolas thing." <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, the two men put on their hats and hurriedly left with the screaming prince of Saco who kept yelling in his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah...ah...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cry of fear is still not coming, Listening to the screaming, Vanas’s mouth showed a happy smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this privileged prince of private life, she has been disgusted for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Pope is really amazing! It’s a mysterious walker in the world, but it’s a look, so that the disgusting guy is so rude, ah Ah! The Pope of the powerful benevolent is the messenger that the gods sent to save me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas’s heart is already flying. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original illusory Pope’s majesty is truly incomparable and tall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Pope is not only a powerful apostle, but also a gentleman full of elegance and courtesy." Vanas has just used words and tone for Su Ge. The saluting posture is very impressive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In order to make it easier for me to step down, I will grieve my noble body and take the initiative to salute me. This kindness and magnanimity is just like the warmth of the sun."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas’s heart was completely shocked by Su Ge’s just-perpetitive means, and he was temporarily caught in a stateless fanaticism. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there are no outsiders, she can’t wait to hug Su Ge’s legs on the ground, expressing her reverence and gratitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty! Your Majesty! Your Majesty!" At this moment, Elena’s voice came from her ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the current situation, so I quickly returned to the righteous color and said: "Come, sit down and say."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illina said seriously: "You have to rest a lot, or the mental illness caused by insufficient sleep may cause hallucinations."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She still doesn't know that her cold, noble queen has become a fanatic of others, thinking that she has just been caused by lack of sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas walked down the steps and said, "Well, I will pay attention. Maria, prepare a new batch of tea." Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, Vanas dismissed all the attendants and guardians. After the three men sat down, Vanas deliberately concealed his intention to know Su Ge and asked Eli directly. Na: "You just said that this Mr. Sotos saved you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, he saved me in the crisis and healed my wounds," Elena said earnestly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Elena added: "Of course, bringing him here is not just because of this. On the way, Mr. Sotos showed The strong knowledge and knowledge, as well as the integrity of morality and quality, make me think that he is a trustworthy good partner!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are right, ask Mr. Toth is indeed our most loyal partner!” Vanas said with a serious look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illina was very happy after listening to it, turned to Su Ge proudly raised his chin and expressed his weight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Geqiang held back his smile and secretly gave her a thumbs up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hurry and talk about the experience and results of this road!" Vanas said quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, she can’t help but want to listen to the heroic deeds of the Pope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irene’s face is serious, from the fact that he has just left the palace, sneaked into the institute, killed the werewolf, investigated the reasons, etc. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas’s face is serious, but “after that?” from her mouth can be heard, for these cases she Does not care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After?" Vanas asked again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illina looked at her own Queen’s heart, although it felt weird, but did not think much, continued: “At that time I was seriously injured, when I fled When a person is attacked by a werewolf, he is saved by his initiative. This person is Su Ge. Then we are surrounded..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Detailed point And then elaborate!" Vanas was attentively focused, and he said very seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illina thought that her Majesty would like to seriously analyze the strength and means of Su Ge, so she said nothing: "I heard a thick bell at the time. , you can see that the invisible shield easily blocks those embarrassing tentacles..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
