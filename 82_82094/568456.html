			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the yellow seal in his hand, Su Ge would not be so in the hands of him, he is very clear about the power and strange connection in this yellow seal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pairing the yellow mark on the palm of his hand, Su Ge’s finger ignited the cold flame and drew a “silver” and “earth” symbol around him, then whispered Author: "From the earth, by the silver, the sealed soil is the four walls of gray."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, the two symbols suddenly extended A lot of silk threads, like two silkworms that are spinning, wrap this yellow print in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a dozen seconds, the entire yellow print surface was covered by a layer of light blue film, and all mysterious fluctuations were completely eliminated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The side of Shirley saw a sneer at the corner of his mouth: "You are a god yourself, actually praying to other gods, it is ridiculous."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger put his pocket watch in his pocket and replied in disappointment: "There is a specialization in the profession, and you and I are in what form, you are very clear. Our Theocracy and divine power are not linked in the rules of the world, only the world is recognized."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley listened and snorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people are strictly foreign gods who do not belong to this world. Although this foreign god has the qualification to exist, the theocracy does not have the rules of docking the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the power that directly leads believers to believe in you, to know your existence, but not to obtain the gods through mysterious rituals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After more than a year of deep understanding of mystery, Su Ge knows that the whole mystery is actually looking at the knowledge of the gods from a human perspective, and by offering Sacrifice to get more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the mystical gods, the gods are divided into three types. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreign gods, local gods and gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of the mysterious systems and spell systems are the absolute core of the local gods, the March goddess. They account for 60% of the total spell score. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the goddess of March, there are also gods of the deep forest, the gods of the earth, the gods of the sea, etc. Although the scale of the beliefs is small, their theocracy has already penetrated into all areas of occultism. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the local gods, the Great God accounted for 30% of the whole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great Gods are all evolved from human beings, and their powers are relatively simple and have no fixed form. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the god of death, the god of power, the god of the eye, the god of blood, and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He relies on a single pure substance and has absolute authority in this respect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last 10% are some alien gods, and the spells of these alien gods generally exist only in the summoning spells. Only the corners of the gods can be summoned, or the Yi people belonging to this god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These summons are accompanied by a very terrifying danger and are marginal things that are rejected by all mysterious systems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, Su Ge’s recent seal is to seal the seal by using the knowledge of the seal god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s good to go out and walk, I feel that I am a true mystery now." Su Ge feels very good laughter. Road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley heard this and couldn’t help but smile. She remembered that for the past year and a half, Sugna’s frowning face, holding a mysterious book scratching his head The embarrassing look made her want to laugh every time she remembered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge naturally knows what she is laughing at. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has read a lot of books over the past year and a half, and has made up a lot of knowledge that he was completely blank or lacking in foundation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Especially in a number of ancillary areas of learning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basic spells, including intensive books, Mars, noise, automatic, etc. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the Shenming processor, he can do several times or even ten times more intense learning than the ordinary mystery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the basic spells, he has studied the knowledge of his previous idioms, rituals, divination, curses, sacrifices, seals, etc. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, today, Su Ge is not like the previous ones, except for killing and fighting, other mane will not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage continued to move forward, and the stop and stop in the middle should have met the martial law to cure the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge lifted the curtains slightly and saw the priests who cured the church on both sides wearing black robes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not far away, the healing church in white robe is undergoing inspections and investigations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that the black and white battle to cure the church is getting worse and worse." Su Ge’s mouth showed a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the church is really chaotic in March, there are still many benefits for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, how is your little believer?" Sherry suddenly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jenny? It has returned to healing the church." Su Ge said freely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the ancient city, Jenny and Vanas decided to go back and act as the intelligence officer of the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then she went back so much. As for the reason, she said it was very direct. After being rescued by the church, she was treated on the mountain cliff and then showed up. Look at the scars on her body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing those scars, the words of the Holy See are particularly distressed. Because of the various kinds of churches in the evening, the Holy Words did not have much doubt, let She returned to the team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, to prevent accidents, her new looks are good, Randall still follows her, and the two have lived together for more than a year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you actually take the initiative to pay attention to others?" Su Ge was surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shelly looked out the window and said, "Her mind is very interesting. I like people who are polluted by darkness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... This standard villain line, I don't know, how many people have already ruined your poisonous hands." Su Ge sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley turned his head and said: "I am a poisonous hand, don't think."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... .........<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half an hour, the group has arrived at the dock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just off the carriage, Sug was the first to see a huge steel cruise in front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cruise ship is overall bright white, looking close to three hundred meters long, the front deck of the hull is wide, like a huge square. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle cabin is towering, with solid windows on both sides, which look very magnificent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope not to bump into the iceberg." Su Ge muttered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Sauroni Ocean Cruises, 300 meters long and weighs 50,000 tons. In today's few storm-class cruises, it is a leader." Burt explained with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley looked at the huge cruise ship, his eyes sparkling with joy: "This thing is quite interesting."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s attention is not on the cruise, but on the front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time the boarding of the cruise ship is nearing completion, and about a hundred people are waiting in line. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of these hundreds of people are accompanied by men and women, dressed in glamorous, elegant and calm, are elites above the middle class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug also saw a few people on the side who were ready to board because they were not dressed, and they were angered and unwilling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a glimpse of the gaze, after confirming that there were no suspicious people, Su Ge followed the team to board the ship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The great god of the sea, please bless us safely!" In front of a few people, a pair of goddess of the sea god, at this time, head down, Pious prayers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge licked his mouth and secretly spit out: "Don't engage in this flag before boarding!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole queuing process went smoothly, more than 100 people Boarded in less than ten minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert bought a higher ticket, which not only allowed Suger to live in the superior room of the cruise, but also to play all the facilities of the cruise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Includes not limited to casinos, pools, theaters, bars, etc. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For this performance of Albert, Su Ge expressed his satisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Standing on a wide deck like a square, Su Ge looked at the rough seas in the distance and suddenly asked: "The college alliance invited me to go, not just teaching. "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, Albert first glanced at it and looked at Sugna’s pale face and smiled: "How are you?" Look out?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I really want to teach, it should be a college, not a college alliance that leads the four colleges. After all, the college alliance It is not a place to teach." Su Ge said casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert sighs and sighs: "It’s not a legend... It’s a black mist, and Luo’s thinking ability is extraordinary.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary bishop is dead, and the name should not be said again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled: "I just like to think around, talk about it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Al Burt made a look at the attendant beside him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attendant retreats and keeps the quietness of the three. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert took a cautious look at Shirley: "The influence of the ancient city has not been expanded, but the entire process has been known by the four colleges. The aftermath of the whole shocked the whole mysterious world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The problem of ancient survivors has always existed, but no one has paid too much attention. After all, there are some minority races. But this time, the horror and cruelty of the Byron Dias people exceeded the imagination of all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge nodded slightly, motioning him to continue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The whole mysterious world is linked together, and the things caused by the Byron Dias have been spread over a large area, which has produced many people with ulterior motives. Thoughts." When it comes to this, Albert has a dignity on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do not have ulterior motives? Institute of Polar Studies? Cold Church?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert sighed: "Not just them, there are some other strengths."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"For example?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For example, the Sorcerer Sisters."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female warlock who masters the power of the element originated from the second dynasty, the Sophia dynasty, which is almost 8,000 years old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elemental spells mastered by the Sofia royal family allowed the female status and elemental spells at that time to grow at a rapid rate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Sofia dynasty has been ruined for many years, it is rumored that Sofia’s royal blood has continued and intends to reinstate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, the female warlock has mastered a large number of resources as an elite of the entire mysterious world, and its organization is extremely united. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If they really want to support the restoration of the royal family, the entire mysterious world will cause severe shocks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about the rest?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The people of the Void family have also appeared frequently in recent times. The mysterious world, and the brotherhood of the king of the Yellow Emperor, who has been annihilated for a long time, suddenly appeared and was looking around for the so-called saints."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Su Ge Suddenly in my heart, I looked at Sherry a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shirley’s eyes blinked and his face was unhappy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge nodded slightly: "In general, I know, tell your questions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert said directly: "There have been a large number of church members in the recent four. In the graduate school, the students are privately drawn down, and the students are deceived from the college to become their mad believers with rich conditions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And the results, the students are not Going crazy is a sacrifice, or a carrier of something evil. In the past six months, there have been more than a dozen accidents, and this is still superficial, and the real result has reached 40 times." Burt heard that his face was very dignified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg heard this accident: "Is there any means for your four colleges to deal with these things?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert’s face is depressed: “This group of people is very hidden and embarrassed. Although the four colleges have many masters, you know that these masters are generally very theoretical. Academic masters, investigating things and playing up the shelves are completely arranging. They don’t have much practical combat power besides teaching.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The system, already knowing when it has been infiltrated, the middle and high-level people are now heart-wrenching, and there is almost no sense of trust."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Albert is righteous: "We really need an expert like you to deal with the cult master!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear is very useful when he hears this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others dare not say that he now deals with those cults and does have a set. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are free to travel to and from the four colleges as a roving teacher of the College Alliance without any doubt, and I, the Dean, the Old Dean are very Believe," Albert said earnestly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Trust me? Have we seen it once?" Su Ge had some surprises. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert seriously answered: "It’s really one time, but the ambitions and means you have shown, as well as your own personality, indicate that you are a The bottom line, and you are on the human side."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
