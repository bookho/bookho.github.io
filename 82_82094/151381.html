			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗷呜噜噜咔咔噶...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blocked shackles are unspeakable A harsh sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg can't see what's going on here. I can only hope that Aideline will quickly inspire the spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a dozen seconds, a thump, Su Ge saw Bart's powerless fall on the ground, the voice is extremely weak and hoarse: "Hurry up, once it is Out of this array, in contact with the rules of the material world, it will form a perfect cycle with the law, and it would be useless to destroy the law."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Suge’s scalp was numb but nervous, and I couldn’t think of anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, Adelin could open his mouth at this time: "Drop it! My compatriots!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sudden process...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, Suger heard a series of sounds like throwing a javelin into the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the sound, I found that there were countless ice thorns around the perimeter of the array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ice thorns seem to have hundreds of them, each of which is about one meter away from each other, and the shape seems to be from the ground. Come out like it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be seen that the green fluorescence dissipated and collapsed near the length of a few hundred meters destroyed by the ice thorn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge stood here and could obviously feel a cold and viscous force suddenly vented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;叽叽叽叽叽叽! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the distant rush, a cockroach fell on the ground, and the green fire that was going along the cervical spine to continue to extend to the body was like being smashed by water. It is completely extinguished in the blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining power is transformed as the spotlight of countless green fireflies gradually dissipates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The harsh, non-human voice continued to spread, and the cockroach's body began to disintegrate rapidly, turning into a femur ash scattered on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge at this time his forehead is blue and violent, his hands are trying to cover his ears, and he keeps meditation and calms his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this only makes his spirit not collapse, and the vision has risen two more points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s just a god, just a glimpse of the avatar. I took a look at the magic array and heard a few screams. It has risen four points!" Su Ge's forehead sweat continued to fall, thinking hard in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, the harsh sound completely subsided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything has returned to normal, the law is destroyed, and energy is dissipated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that exists is the white hoe that falls on the ground and burns with a green flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge turned his head and glanced at it. After seeing this gimmick and making sure that his vision did not show up, he hurriedly turned to Bart. "Bat, are you okay?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart's face was sallow, his lips were chapped, and he was so weak that he seemed to be a teenager. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The problem is not big, it will be good to cultivate for a while." Bart was seated hard under the help of Su Ge, watching the burning green fire. Head, eyes flashing with the light said: "This is the remnant of our Green Flame Brotherhood call, I must recycle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aideline said faintly: "Don't rush to recycle, this thing is indeed a legacy, but from another point of view, this is also a very powerful secret treasure, we have spent so much power, so precious treasures let you alone swallow, is it a little too Excessive?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart wry smile: "I know what you mean, so I will give you a satisfactory price when I arrive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aideline nodded slightly, carrying a pair of golden-grained gloves, and walked over to prepare to close the skull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be careful! Adeline!" Suddenly, Su Ge screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adeline was also inductive at this moment, and the body suddenly retraced backwards, and the big hand was holding a thick ice wall in front of it...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like a high-explosive grenades suddenly blasting, Adeline’s ice wall is broken instantly, and the body directly flies three meters away, a few steps, almost falling inverted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who!!" Adeline licked the blood of her mouth and asked with a gloomy voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s face is extremely dignified and stands next to Adeline, whispering: “A very terrible person!”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just now, restoring some psionic Sug to turn on their voice ability to determine if there are any clergy around the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, at the moment of opening, he heard a faint gasp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Little guy, really good knowledge!" Calm, with a smile of laughter suddenly sounded in Suger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the moment of the sound, Su Ge looked at the ripples and locked it directly into a black shadow that was quickly rushing to Adeline. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He can actually feel my hidden investigation!" Su Ge was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the smoke, wearing a black robe, the tall man with a black goat mask came out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He holds a native yellow book in his left hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The books are not big, the size of the two palms, the lines have a lot of weird and disgusting lines, and in these lines, you can see some of the tiny teeth. Big mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The giant worm sings!" Seeing the book, Adeline's face was extremely dignified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black man had some accidents, and there was a chuckle under the mask: "The erudition of the female warlock is really not a name."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said, the black man shook his right hand, and in his right hand, held a skull full of green flames. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let it down! It belongs to the Green Flame Brotherhood!" Bart struggled and screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black people smiled: "Green Flame Brotherhood? Children, don't use your narrow world view to measure things far beyond imagination!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black man said, holding up the skull and looking at it carefully, while watching and saying: "Listen to this voice and see what this beautiful look and the flames are. The soul is really intoxicating!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adelin pinches his cane and whispers: "The worm is a sixth-order magic book, at least Have 60 points to see the contents, find a chance to run quickly! He is not what we can deal with!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly, body Hidden back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Would you like to go? Little guy? There are not so many people who have such rumors about the sound!" The black man’s sharp eyes are now locked directly. Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, Su Ge is like a cold cave, and his body is stiff, even if he wants to take a step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How did you find me?" asked Sug. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black people seem to be in a hurry and say, "It’s very simple, it’s natural to see."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"See!?" Su Ge snorted because he thought of a possibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black people pointed to their own eyes: "This world is so colorful and colorful. Unfortunately, human beings are too fragile to accept so beautiful. Deep things, so there is a division of the vision."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lingsight is a good thing, although it gradually takes us out of the human form, gradually approaching The abyss, but it gradually made me see the essence of the world and many truths."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black man stared sharply at Su Ge and said: "When When you have 88 points of vision, you know how I saw it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
