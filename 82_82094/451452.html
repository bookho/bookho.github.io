			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a long time, Father Water looked up at Su Ge and then raised his finger on his finger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is silent, then understands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Church of the Holy Blood has arrested him, and the cell is the library. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day the Holy Blood Library was leveled, and Suge clearly saw the huge non-human skull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the size is huge, it looks non-human. But Su Ge still sees it, it is a human skull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though Su Ge knows through the body why the skull will mutate into this appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Scope?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French Waters's eyelids are pulled down: "Bern City."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug raises his head Looking at the vast Cathedral of the Holy Blood, the invisible power on Su Ge's body seems to suppress him all the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you still dream?" Su Ge suddenly switched topics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French Water shook his head: "Dream is very dangerous for us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Looking back at the old dream of the ancient city that day, he nodded slightly and asked: "Is there any interest?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wortella's eyelids lifted slightly: "Where?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God country."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watt's turbid pupil tightened slightly, dry hands Play with a few of his dilapidated clothes: "Why leave?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Emilia has a problem, there is Nell, the stars can not accommodate me." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walt did not speak, still looked at him, he thought that this problem is not enough to become a problem for Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge smiled. Feel free to lean on the chair and say, "It's too small."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yesterday met with Ada, let Su Ge think of a lot of things, has been more confused The heart has become more determined and the direction is clearer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What he wants to accomplish, and the church in March will be completely left, and it will not be conducive to his development. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How old are you?" asked Walter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug is like laughing and laughing, holding up his hands and gestures: "So big."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I really can't let go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, the two people are silent for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not afraid of telling you?" Walter asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge looked at him calmly, without answering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walter smiled: "Also, the hatred of the Church of the Holy Blood, I am far more than you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't want to be your servant, like the female warlock and the vampire," Walter added. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug did not answer and said: "He likes your sickle very much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" In some places, the sickle symbolizes death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walter looks at Su Ge: "So?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Are you interested in becoming a death?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walter listened to the heart and slammed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you have such a right to speak?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled: "Of course. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Walter has been silent for a longer time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do I need to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s just a dream." Su Ge stood up and relaxed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French raises his head and looks at the pleasing eye of Su Ge: "Good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge sighed with a sigh of relief and smiled and turned away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh! Right."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg seems to think of something, curiously asked: "What is Kiruyishla?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walter is silent, as if thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the old saying, it means the monster hidden behind the door."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Others? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walter’s deep eyes glanced at him and said blankly: “There was a monster called Kiruyishra, but with the old saying Lost, changed the name."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The key to the door. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled, smiled a little happy, and laughed a little relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pace of walking out of the Holy Blood Library, Su Ge looked up at the sky and found that today's sun is completely different from yesterday. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s still so warm, still so bright, but it’s extraordinarily transparent and beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He reached out and touched his heart, something he had figured out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cathedral prayer room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jerouss is here today, I will leave tomorrow." Emilia looked at Su Ge and had some surprises in her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She feels that today's Su Ge, and yesterday's Su Ge seem to have changed someone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The momentum, the gas field, the eyes are completely different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge didn’t ask much, he said seriously: “Please remember that Guinness is your solid shield.”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Su Ge’s eyes, Emilia remembered the return of Griffin’s own self, and the rare joy in her calm eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of happiness is not the kind of happiness that gets power, but the happiness of being cared for. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I can't come back, don't come back." Emilia looked at him seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a bit awkward, but Su Ge can understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why are you going back?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emilia turned her head and looked at the colorful light in the multicolored window: "Because there is still fantasy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looked at her back and suddenly felt that she was a little pitiful: "If you have an accident, I will save you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Why?" Emilia asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question is very weird. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled: "This way I have an excuse to snatch the Holy Grail."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Emilia's mouth tilted slightly: "Good ambition, the world must have changed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One point I am very curious." Su Asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are so many twenty-five babies in the church, the church really Don't know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Emilia squinted at her lips but didn't want to laugh: "Every church is like this. The roots of each other must go deeper." The other's field, the second and fifth... spies is not nothing, as long as it is properly mastered, the spies are also undercover."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge knew: "Like Griffin?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s like you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Ha ha ha!" Su Ge couldn't help but laugh out loud. After <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, Su Ge did not ask much, and Emilia did not say much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people are relatively reserved for a lot of things, keeping enough distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still the pub of yesterday. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the corner table, Su Ge and Govins sit opposite each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two people drink relatively elegant today, with a small mouth and a slow taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it cold in the sky?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gwens nodded: "Of course it's cold, otherwise it won't drink."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Unknown old king, do you know?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gwens is silent: "Is that old thing still dead?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone Are you not dead, can you die in your own heart?" Su Ge laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gwens raised his head and drank a glass of wine, slightly swearing: "Also."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp During the conversation, Su Ge felt a mysterious wave of volatility that seemed to spread towards this side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gwens is somewhat unhappy: "It’s a bunch of annoying bugs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug He: "Photographed to death?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Shooting dead!" Gwens put down the glass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The alley in the back street of the pub. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't kill me! Don't kill me!" A young man pleads with a tear in his arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug stood aside and looked at the other two bodies with interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not the body that is interested in Su Ge, but the death of the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are ribs inserted in the back of the body, passing through the heart and nailing them to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood spread silently on the filthy floor, and Su Ge curiously asked, "How did you do it?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When two people came out, they walked side by side, followed by three mysterious people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not know when, Su Ge found that Govins disappeared, of course, when he returned to God, he had already circled behind three people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get used to it!" said Graces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge stood up: "What is the habit of letting the undead people like the backstab?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp He remembers the last undead, Clausen, who also used the backstab when fighting Luke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gwens arbitrarily explained: "There are a lot of monsters in the night, and it is easy to be killed by a single-handedly going out. Gradually we are used to using this method." Silently kill all the monsters around, leaving a simple heads-up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The night is long, unconsciously, The backstab has already raised the cost."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gwens said that this is somewhat helpless: "Now I want to go up and give it a knife, because this situation has already It caused a lot of trouble."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug recalled that just after Gwens had been stabbing, his face had a long-lost excitement and enjoyment. Lived and laughed: "You are really interesting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't kill me! Don't kill me! I have intelligence! I have intelligence." The young man on the ground said in a panic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gwens's dark eyebrows pick one: "Say!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face is pale He said: "This evening, a group of students will hold a student meeting. The information says that people who hold blood sacrifices will also participate. Are you looking for this thing? We can..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the man didn't finish it, he was pierced by Ge Wensi's chest: "Who is interested in that kind of thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Gwens is not interested, but Su Ge has come to interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because this person is talking about the party he wants to attend this evening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, let these three people disturb the interest. What are your plans for the next?" Ge Wensi asked for a lack of hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am going." Su Ge said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gwens spread his hand: "Well, then I went to sleep."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he finished, he threw a slap in the slap of Sug. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this?" Su Ge played with the horn and touched it like a horn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will blow it when I am in trouble, I will arrive soon." After that, the body disappeared into the alley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge looked down at the bodies of three people and then contacted the clergy to wash the land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At three o'clock in the afternoon, Gerlos arrived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a set of processes, the two of them saw each other more than a year later, and Su Ge felt a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerousus is still the time to go, white hair, white beard, strong body, full of years of vicissitudes and maturity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only difference is that when he walks, he wears a costume of a hunter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
