			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug does not know how long he has slept, and he can’t enter the dream as a god in the darkness of sleep. He seems to be trapped in consciousness by countless messy thoughts. In the space, surrounded by scattered and chaotic thoughts, he is extremely irritated while looking for constant source. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, he made a first dream to come to this world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dream he became a strange fog, this mist is constantly reorganizing, turning into steam, steam turns into bubbles, and reciprocates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can’t tell if he’s the fog, or a bubble in the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He feels that his thoughts have been extended indefinitely, as if he can reach the end of the world, and even climb every world and every corner of the universe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened to me? What am I doing?" Su Ge was full of confusion at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;噗噗噗...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, all the bubbles suddenly burst, and countless fogs are infinite The collapse has formed an indescribable singularity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My Lord, we have conquered the end of the abyss, and White Frost has frozen all the disgusting guys." The voice didn't know where it came from. I don't know where to pass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My Lord! Go! Go! This is a trap! This world... This world is... ah ah!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hide up! Hide! The world has no hope of redemption, even no disqualification..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lord! Go! Find the call to our existence, find %%##¥%, we still...can..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Array, swear!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The warriors who rise up in the hard, frozen wasteland, raise your swords and offer us everything to our great hoarfrost!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The knights born in the eternal storm of desperation, pinch your reins and offer us everything to our great storm god!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The twisted nightmare warlocks, wielding your scepter and offering us everything to our great dream master!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no mess, it’s fierce, Unbeatable, extremely fierce, incomparably crazy, extremely bloody...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the feeling that Su Ge heard these sounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I...who is it!? Why should I come to this world!?" Su Ge thought hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, the long and thick bells sounded, all the mess, all the anxiety, all the irritations were calmed down, even the incomprehensible thoughts were stunned by this clock. The sound gradually became smooth, from a mess of clutter to a neat line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am...Sug Sotos." Su Ge said, slowly opening his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank God, you are finally awake, the Pope."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment of opening your eyes Su Ge first saw the face that Hills was filled with happiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge slowly sat up and said calmly: "How long have I been dizzy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Twenty hours." On the side, Luke’s voice came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge entered a state of incomparable calmness at this moment, nodded and stood up and asked: "How is the situation?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four people are silent and say: "The end is already coming."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug brows slightly wrinkled: "What do you mean? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aideline ugly let her body open, and some glaring red bloody sunsets came in through the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's see for yourself!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug squinted to the window and looked through the window, a burst of suffocation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes are uncontrollable, as if they are falling out of the eyelids, and the indescribable fear lingers in Su Ge’s mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪嗒! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spiritually increased by five points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking around, the entire city of Bain has been a mess, and the surrounding area has been completely covered by the mountain-like fleshy body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sky, the huge darkness of the array has been fully formed, covering the entire city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless stars on the top, not included. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the ground, dozens of individual models are extremely large, with huge worms like squid heads lying on the ground, completely encircling the entire city from the outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These bugs have strange lines on their bodies, just like magical arrays. Their distorted horror can't be described, each body has a length of hundreds of meters, giving people a suffocating oppression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the ground, the ordinary citizens who have witnessed such indescribable fears have been completely mad, and their faces are lingering in the streets of the city, and they are tens of thousands. Like a zombie in a movie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge saw the honest baker Mr. Parker among them and saw the kind and serious forensic doctor, Mr. Adam, who saw the neighbours of the past, see I went to a colleague who had laughed together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The streets are already in a mess, the streets are full of big pits, the ground is falling, the pipes that transport gas are broken and burning, and many places have been covered by the skylight . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As just four people said, the end has come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sufficient silence for ten seconds, Su Ge closed his eyes and lowered his head, wiped the blood and tears from the corner of his eyes and asked: "Is this a giant worm?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, adult." Luke confirmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s voice was a little hoarse. “These bugs should have been parasitic in people’s bodies. Did you drill it last night?”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you know?" Adelion asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge simply said his previous analysis, Luke was very surprised to hear, because the analysis of Su Ge and what they saw yesterday not bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How are these worms fighting?" Su Ge’s calm and scary, faint question. Luke touched his chin and said: "The attacking power is definitely nothing to say. It’s almost like a broken bone. But they are very bulky, and they don’t seem to be attacking, just It is to make people in the city unable to go out and wait for what is coming."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge took off his robe and put on his own relatively loose preparation, suitable for battle. Suit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is things ready?" Su Ge asked Adeline. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adeline nodded and turned to take out a parcel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Includes some silver-gray badges and masks<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The badge is made of sterling silver and its shape is A big clock with a long gun full of lightning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This badge is the badge that represents the church of the late bell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The badge is in the dream, Adeline according to the requirements of Su Ge, the church badge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mask is pure white, barely able to see that it is a ghostly god full of majesty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put the badge on your chest and wear a mask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s cane, calmly said: “Although the fate is so, the personnel is not exhausted. It’s time to start the name of our late church.” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
