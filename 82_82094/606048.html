			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looked at Marchi and smiled and asked, "How? Is it wonderful? Is it shocking my technology?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marqui’s face stared at Su Ge in a gloomy voice, asking, “Who are you, the average master swordsman can’t reach this level.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge sorted out the sleeves of the suit, and some puzzled asked: "I am a bit strange. How do you all these cultists like to use their own impressions to evaluate other people? You are also "Your death is also the opposite."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you mean?" Marchie heard this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who told you that I am a swordsman?" Su Ge asked with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;! ! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, Marchie’s heart trembled, and I thought of a possibility in my mind: “The secret profession!”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yeah, this thing is not a rare thing, I have a secret profession is very rare?" Su Ge said casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there are other mysterious people on the side who hear this, I can’t wait to swear, and my temper is even easy to be stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole mysterious world, the secret profession is more rare and precious than the secret treasure, how is it as common in the mouth of Su Ge as a potato? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Markey faintly stepped back, secretly prepared for the psionic shield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugna's swift speed, fierce sniper, horrible swordsmanship, she has all seen it, rushing to fight with him, she has no advantage . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweeping around the eyes, there are hundreds of deep dive as their helpers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then she shouted: "The servants of the great God, killing the sorcerer who prevented the birth of the Son of God."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon hearing this order, a large number of deep dive on the ship immediately turned to the ugly head that was abhorrent, and burst into a real hostility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, these deep dive people did not rush like the Kraken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deep-slugglers are first and orderly leaning around the image of the Cthulhu, and it seems that the statue has been protected as the highest priority. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A kind of green scale, the deep dive of the white belly slightly forward, stretched out the meat, and caught the rain falling from the sky. Then suddenly slammed forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a burst of fierce sound came. The raindrops that were held in their hands turned into bullet-like attacks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge's look is a little unexpected, with a wave of his hand, the evening bells appear in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰砰砰...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the sound of bullets hitting the steel plate in the rain It sounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After seeing Sug, the deep-slung of these white bellyes did not have any other movements, and the body took a step back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind them is a group of deep-slendered gray belly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These deep-dives are larger and have these thin scales on the belly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This deep dive is not empty, holding a long black thing in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge looked at it carefully, and he was shocked because he found that the group of deep dive people was actually holding a model that he didn’t know. Automatic rifle! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this?" Shelley was very curious when she saw these things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge squinted at these things, and the inspiration suddenly felt a faint crisis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, these deep dive people have raised their guns and fired at Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哒哒哒...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a burst of sound, the dozens of muzzles It flashed a strange blue light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge suddenly propped up the night bell to protect, the whole body tightly clasped Shirley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哗啦啦......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next second, dozens of hairs pop up in front of Su Ge, He easily crushed his late bell to protect his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, Su Ge had already felt strange and prepared, and the body suddenly rushed to the side, barely avoiding most of the bullets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark red blood splashed in the air, and there were few stray bullets that didn’t have time to dodge, breaking the skin of Su Ge’s shoulders, arms and thighs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;噗嗤...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood is low on the ground, corroding the smooth floor Dent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge looked down at his wound, and the skin around him had turned into emerald green, which seemed to be poisoned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, these toxins did not continue to spread and seemed to have no effect on the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger is a little dignified at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know these things?" The curiosity on Sherry's face was even more serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded: "This is an automatic rifle that can continuously produce a large number of bullets, which is much more powerful than a pistol."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking down at the wound, Su Ge continued: "The bullet has been specially treated, not only has the effect of breaking the magic, but also has a deadly toxin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp After all, the deep dive on the side was not in a hurry. After seeing Su Ge being hit, it was like a hunter who hit the prey, with a playful and calm eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Their wisdom is no worse than humans." Su Ge said in a low voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley is casual: "This group of people is the core of the Cthulhu family. They don't die naturally and have a very long life. For example, you humans are no different from those that can only live a summer. It is natural to have a way to deal with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge At a glance, the cane became an umbrella and said: "But because of their physical problems, they do not have any powerful ability, and those who are not many moons are relying on external technology."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley is still very casual, watching the rifles in these deep dive ask: "These things... are the same products as the previous phones, which belong to that era?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s face nodded solemnly: “Yes, this group of guys actually had the technology of the last era before the era of great destruction, and mass production, In other words, Ksulu really is related to the destruction of the last era."< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley laughed and said: "The stupid big octopus can really destroy the whole world? The world is really fragile."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug did not speak, pinch the iron umbrella in his hand and said seriously: "You will take care of yourself for yourself. In the face of this kind of attack, if you take the initiative, I may not be able to take care of you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassure, I will not die if you die." Shirley's tone is still as cold and stinging. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled and walked with an iron umbrella to the deep dive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This group of guys is a mysterious killer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, after a year and a half, Su Ge set his own attitude for the first time and went all out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your toxin, is it okay?" Sherry suddenly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge replied: "Nothing, my blood is not white."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
