			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Quiet down?" I don't know how long it took, Duke and Stephen heard the calm voice of Sugna. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke looked up and looked at Su Ge’s smiling face and asked, "Is this the way you let my uncle calm down?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Step by side said, "I remembered, I heard this sacred and distant bell. At that time, I was completely into trouble." In the description of fear and frenzy, it seems to be drowned in the dark earth, and when my will is about to dissipate, this sacred bell calms down my spirit with unspeakable great power, and falls into peace. Sleeping."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Duke was shocked when he heard it, and looked more shocked at Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge True Color explained: "This is the night of the soul of the town, the gift that my Lord has given me. Anyone who hears the bell will get The sanctuary of my Lord, away from fear and confusion, falls into peace and peace."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear this, Duke immediately asks about the existence of Su Ge’s beliefs. However, Su Ge interrupted: "This thing has passed, now the two should have some understanding of what kind of existence is the real god?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Two people converge in the heart, thinking back to the four principles that Su Ge said, and suddenly filled with fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there really a god in the world?" Duke asked incomparably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge seriously answered: "Yes, I saw it with my own eyes. You should also feel something, the strange feelings and experiences on board. That is The influence of the gods on the world after the coming of the gods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke heard this, his face was extremely pale, the sense of sinking, twisting, fear at that time Let him not forget it so far. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait, that's not to say god..." Duketon was even more astonished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled and said: "Reassured, that evil god has been swayed by my master and taken away from the world. You really think that those fogs are ordinary. Is it foggy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon hearing this, Duke suddenly recalled that he was surrounded by fog when he was about to collapse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that feeling seems to be the most sturdy protection, and the most kindly appeasement, allowing yourself to maintain yourself in that distortion and fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It turned out that I have been sheltered by the gods." Duke suddenly resigned his heart and even felt faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug continued: "The shadow that your uncle saw was the messenger of the gods. It follows the guidelines of the imprint and takes this sacrifice away. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"!!!" The two people suddenly became nervous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"However, I replaced your uncle with my special flame as a sacrifice, and let the messenger of the god be satisfied. So, in a short time, you Uncle is still safe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing this, Duketon breathed a sigh of relief, and Steven asked: "What should we do next? Master Wright The family is very important."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke followed and nodded: "Uncle Wright is my father's younger brother, very important to our family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge then picked up the cup and glanced at the crystal clear liquid in the cup and said: "Two methods, the first one, find out the female ghoul, let it lift this A sacrifice, but this is almost impossible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why? I can give her a lot of money!" Duke said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge said plainly: "It’s not a question of money. Any sacrifice to the gods is extremely dangerous. A little carelessness will involve the whole family. And even the whole blood."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So serious?" Duke's eyes widened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge stretched his fingers and said: "Give an example, my personal experience. In my hometown, one of my friends was misled by someone who blamed him. Cursed with blood, causing him to become a sacrifice. I have spent a great deal of power to free him from this curse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The man who scolded him was a rich man. After he was unwilling to curse my friend through cursing, his sacrifice failed under the protection of my Lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Do you know what the result is?" Su Ge asked with a cold face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke two people shook their heads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The sacred wrath, his messenger instantly ate all the direct blood of the family. In the morning, everyone else for this family The memory has completely disappeared."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pump! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear this, Duke’s heart slams, his face pale, and the six gods have no ownership. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stephen said with a trembling voice: "This matter... this matter should be reported to the master."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The bell rang again and the two gradually returned to normal. Duke took a deep breath: "I am sorry, I am dying."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug Calmly waved his hand: "Tear away, let's talk about the situation at hand. I only said that it is impossible, because any method of changing the sacrifice is accompanied by a huge price. Just like the situation, if she is allowed to cancel The sacrifice represents the wrath of the gods, then after your uncle has survived, it is her own."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, the two people suddenly became clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, people are dead, and there is no place for money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about the second method?" asked Stephen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge said: "Have a sacrifice ceremony to replace your uncle's life from the ceremony with a hundredfold sacrifice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hundreds of sacrifices? That's not..." Duke's face is not very good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge sneered: "If mediocrity and cultists are expected to make such devastating anti-human behavior, don't forget who I am." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
