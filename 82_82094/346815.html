			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After about five or six minutes, a large group of people led the attendants to the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This team looks like sixteen, taking the lead with Oliver and a handsome, but relatively sluggish youth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Prince Jean!?" Many nobles suddenly screamed after seeing this sluggish youth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the talking on the inside, Vanas heard this, and the gamble suddenly turned back. When I saw the familiar face with a dull face, my eyes were faintly red. The heart is full of distress and grief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, this sluggish youth is the prince who has been a werewolf before, missing for two months, Jean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jean!?" Vanas wanted to step forward, but was stopped by Vegginia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Calm down, kneel. This jean should be alone with your brother. He has a very strong mysterious wave in his body. He is not ordinary. Man."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas heard this moment calm down and thought of the embarrassment of the Pope, she took a deep breath and slowly returned to calm. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Randall whispered: "Your Majesty, for whatever reason, keep a certain distance from them. These people are very dangerous."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas looked at the jealous face of Jean, and he nodded in his heart and said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rhythm that has just been controlled by Vanas is suddenly oscillated by the sudden appearance of Prince Jean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge hides in the crowd, his eyes carefully look at the group of people who come in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people are wearing uniform black dresses, and there seem to be two relatively noble aristocrats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the sixteen people, there are fourteen mysteries in Jean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oliver is a master, others look at the subtle psionic fluctuations, there should be four experts, and the rest are professional."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "As for the profession, I can't see it. According to the eloquence of Master Gerald, Oliver is a master of the soul-hunter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hunter... ...It’s a troublesome career.” Su Ge had some headaches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hunter is a relatively special profession, it does not belong to the regular profession, but it does not reach the height of the secret profession. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hunter is a variant of the Necromancer, and the game language is a special transfer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Necromancer is a mysterious occupation of the body based on the knowledge of human death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul hunter is above this, is a profession dedicated to the soul. This kind of profession has a very powerful mental attack, and many means can directly affect the human soul. Even serious, causing permanent damage to the human soul, the light is always mad, the serious soul is taken away, and the fart is on the spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, many nobles who were there knew that Oliver was the red man next to the Duke of the Mountain Range, and quickly said hello to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg retracted his gaze to determine the state of Vanas at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just looking back, I saw Randall doing two consecutive identical gestures to myself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gesture represents a certainty, two consecutive servants have already responded, and at the same time identified Su Ge’s conjecture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the edge of the central ring near the outer city has become chaotic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After dinner, or after a taste of quirky taste, the consciousness began to faint, and there was a sense of arrogance in the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This arrogant feeling is getting more and more intense, and finally, with a scream, these people completely lose their sense of self. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you can see from the sky, there are already dozens of dressed wore clothes on the street, black hairs all over the body, strong and powerful, and fangs and claws of the werewolves walking aimlessly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰砰砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the room on both sides of the building, suddenly rushed out one after another black shadow, then steadily landed on the ground, violent scarlet eyes staring around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They seem to be not hostile to the same type of werewolf, and are extremely aggressive against any strange creature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stray dogs, stray cats, etc., did not escape the palms of these werewolves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a relatively hidden room, Lance looked at the werewolf on the street through the curtains, his face was not very good, said: "I still haven’t caught up? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Knight, what should we do?" Behind him are twelve people who have men and women, although they are dressed in clergy. But each body is strong and strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that even if it is not a mysterious person, it is not the kind of ordinary person who can't help but feel the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, there are no physical means to preach outside this year. Why do you let people listen to you quietly? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lance nodded: "The plague that Mr. Zhong Ren said has already begun. Although you can protect the plague with the help of the Lake Elf, but face So many werewolves will only die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people are in a dilemma after listening to their ugly faces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are waiting here with peace of mind, I will protect the entire room with the elves and protect the whole room from the werewolf. I will go outside and see if I can find it." The method of breaking the game."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lance said to go to the inner room of the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, when Lance stepped out, he brought a pure purple, covered metal knight helmet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a pure purple sword in the hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sword is about one meter two, about the width of the palm of the hand, and the beautifully embossed on the hilt. The sword is a butterfly with open wings, which is very wide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blade is not thin and looks slightly thicker than the normal sword, but the purple blade is very sharp, flashing cold cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is..." When they saw the sword, these missionaries were very excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the "no regrets determination" of one of the legendary three lake swords?" The missionary excitedly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lance nodded, pinching the hilt and explaining: "This is the treasure that the Lord has given me. It can't be used when it is absolutely necessary. But now, I I think it is time to use it. At this moment, I will fulfill my creed and code as a knight, and carry out the will and determination. Just like this sword, no regrets."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a scream, the plague was released, and the three polar institutes who had not had time to evacuate were torn by a group of werewolves, and the blood and internal organs were scattered. One place is extremely miserable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't worry about them, go to the next place, our time is very urgent!" The rest of the people quickly got into the carriage and went to the next escort of the mysterious person. A key location. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Salo floated in midair on a quirky metal disc, watching the sky quickly become more and more, the wolverine, the face Happy and gratified, with his arms wide open: "Our ideals, our wish has finally come true!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the ground, the number of werewolves increased rapidly, It may be that these changes are too quiet and rapid, without any panic, and cruel killing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the family, more and more werewolves jumped out of the window and joined the wandering team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
