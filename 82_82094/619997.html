			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge said here: "I have been paying attention to the witch hunting, and the church has no doubts about you now?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the Yagu Castle incident, Su Ge applied for Gerlos and his own actions, and was approved by Emilia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no emergence of Jellos throughout the ancient city. The reason for the explanation was that Jerouss went to follow the crowds of the cold church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This reason is very convincing, because when Gerlos appeared again, he was carrying the attacking bishop of the church camp, the head of the cold-binding person went back. At the same time, the body still has a lot of wounds and frostbite, and the acting is perfect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to the Imperial Capital, Gerlos was still on the verge of the right of the Holy See for the reason of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after Gerlos entered the lord class, the status of the whole person has changed dramatically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Archbishop has finally mastered some practical rights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss replied: "There is still some doubt, they have not let me touch the core things. My main task now is to be responsible for docking with Adeline. And the management of the demon hunters in the Xicheng District of the Imperial City, for mysterious investigations and pursuits."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Determining the situation of Gerlos, Vanas turned to ask Ai Delin: "What is the need for Archbishop Adeline?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adeline said: "I need to help me solve the problem of the reincarnation." Warlock's problem, my current identity is very sensitive, I can't directly shoot. At the same time, Admiral has been investigating me through Bernice, I don't want them to know my identity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas listened to Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly: "This is no problem, Admiral Green, Admiral Kos, the female warlocks are handed over to me, you are the peacekeeper to be your female Marquis. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the matter of Hui Yaocheng was dealt with, Randall, who was in the lion empire, reported: "Cure the black and white battle inside the church is very serious. The state of water and fire is not allowed, even now someone has invited the Assassin League to assassinate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas nodded with satisfaction: "This is a good opportunity for us to let Jenny seize the opportunity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge followed and asked: "That How about the ghosts that came out of the tomb?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Randall replied: "The giant demon spirits have all been disposed of, but the core The guy seems to have escaped in a special way. The guy seems to have been sheltered by a certain god. He has acquired the body with his soul. At present, it is no different from normal human beings. According to the report of the astrologer, he seems to be looking for What is it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge instantly thought of the yellow seal and Shirley in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's best not to bother me." Su Ge said coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the brief meeting, everyone walked out of the worship hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerousus and Su Ge walked side by side with a weird smile on his face and asked, "Is the method I gave you is not good?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger smiled bitterly: "He is tired, you are still preparing for marriage with Ms. Aideline. People are married for eight years of love and long-distance running. You both love eight." Ten years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerousus patted Sug's shoulder: "I have some experience recently, I have time to talk."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, Sug got up and stretched out to open the curtains, bright The sun shines through the window, giving a warmth of peace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening the window and taking a breath of fresh air, Sug stepped on the ground: "It’s still land."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After breakfast, the already packed up, Bernice said: "I want to participate in a picnic with a tribe in the aristocratic circle today. What are your plans?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge said: "Let's just stroll around and see if you can trigger sometime events."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Trigger random events?" Shelly brows a pick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge touched his chest and said: "I don’t know how many mysterious and mysterious things are hanging on my body. My inspiration tells me, even if I am stable, some The guy who is doing things will still find me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After holding the Holy Grail of Soul, Su Ge’s feelings in this area are becoming clearer and clearer. The more accurate it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Betty said with a smile: "I will be optimistic about the family, do you both come back to eat at noon?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not waiting for Sug to speak, Shirley said: "Come back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl is very satisfied with Betty's cooking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Great, I will buy some ingredients to come back later." Betty finished, bounced and turned into the kitchen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley waved a hand, a dark thing into the shadow of Betty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dressing up, two people walked out of the door at 8:30 in the morning, and Sug’s shaking cane said, “You seem to like this little girl very much.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl took a light purple umbrella and nodded slightly: "She has an aura that I like."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Aura?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl did not continue to talk, and opened the topic: "What do you think of blood and wine?" 〔 /> /> </ br> <br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shelly’s mouth reveals a sinister smile, with a tone of approval saying: “The person who invented the blood wine is a somewhat intelligent person.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh! It's really super-high evaluation!" Su Ge knows more about the unit of measure in her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person who is said to be wise by her can be said to be a great sage who can open up a new system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You didn't seem to have any interest in blood wine before?" Su Ge looked at her sinister smile with interest and asked unexpectedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people have been exposed to a lot of blood and wine in a year and a half, but the overall feeling is not very good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shelly lifted her white chin slightly, and said with a loner: "These were all inferior imitations of civil organizations, you didn't smell this. Is there a special bloody fragrance in the city? This is the unique blood wine of the church in March."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge moved his nose and shook Shaking his head: "I didn't smell it, I am not a dog."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You said that I am a dog!?" Shirley heard this and suddenly browed. The apricot is big. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Cough, it doesn't mean this." Su Ge immediately reached out and hugged her body to prevent her from suddenly exploding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a good tolerance for Sherry, who was comforted by the service, and said: "There is time to taste."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem." Listening to her saying this also evokes Su Ge's curiosity about blood and wine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people go out from the east side of Beth Street and follow the north-south direction of Blade Street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal of the two people today is very clear, that is to go to the empire's most honorable Ten Wins Gate to see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, that is the backbone of the entire Berant Empire for many years, the pride of every empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley is not a cold there, but she heard that there is a nice flower bed there, especially the very rare black flowers that let her looking forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the blade street, it took about five minutes to go north. Su Ge’s mouth showed a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he saw an acquaintance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the right side of the wide slate road, there is a very stylish store. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entrance to the store is carved from special white rock, with beautiful reliefs on both sides of the door frame and on the sill, and a spire on the top of the store. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire store has a strong theological style, sophisticated, complex and cumbersome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the door of the store, the two women dressed in plain, sly faces are preparing to walk in, it is Ms. Mary and Ms. Angie who have not slept overnight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four people just took a face-to-face. After seeing the refreshing Su Ge, Miss Mary suddenly had a bright eyes and a happy face. Said: "I am very glad to meet you, Mr. Assassin, Mrs. Assassin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The side of Anji saw some dodging, after all, before each other There are some unhappiness and even conflicts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug said with a smile: "It’s a coincidence that the mighty city of Hui Yao can still meet each other. It must be a good fate." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl did not speak, eyes looked at this full of theological shop, his face was interested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The look of the two ladies seems to be a little bit too good." Su Ge said earnestly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary sighed and said: "You also know that the situation, especially the special rituals, let us have a lot of things." The shadow of my heart, yesterday we two people have been doing nightmares, sleeping very bad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge sighed: "Yes! I slept last night. Not very good, now I feel that my body is still very tired."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary has seen some of Su Ge’s means, knowing that Su Ge is only expressing sympathy for his own situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no way today, we are both going to buy two bottles of blood wine that helps sleep, improve our sleep, hope that this nightmare will come early ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
