			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Virginia yelled, wiped the blood on his face, turned to look at Su Ge, grinned: "We met again, Su Ge "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at her appearance at this time, Su Ge did not feel gloomy and horrible, but felt very cool and cute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not the kind of sacred white lotus, he has a set of his own value system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The damn person should kill in the most cruel way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When wielding a big sword, Vegginia smiled and walked over here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hills instantly puts his front in front of Su Ge and is alert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Women?" Vegginia saw a look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a burst of indescribable sultry in her eyes, and she said, "Suge, I really didn’t misread you! You and Like me, I have values ​​that are very different from those of ignorant people, and at the same time hold the justice that belongs to us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge listened, but some reactions Come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t expect that Vigny, who had only seen one side, could see himself so thoroughly! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hills is close to Su Ge and whispers: "The Pope, I can feel, she... she seems to have a strong affection for you." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey? Love at first sight?" Su Ge's careful liver suddenly became a little nervous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vignia gradually approached and smiled: "Looking out, your identity should be similar to me, and it is the last hope in these corrupt churches." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What last hope?" Su Ge felt that he couldn't keep up with Vigania's thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Virginia asked with a look: "Are you not persecuted by the church, lurking in this church to secretly develop your own strength, prepare this? The decaying and erroneous church is completely destroyed, and the endless anger that has been turned into a dragon is vented on the bodies of these sinful people, and then a new order is established on their bodies?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge listened to the second burst of the table, and shook his head again and again: "No, I don't, I am not."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vignia suddenly grabbed Su Ge’s hand said in a serious manner: “It seems that you have not yet awakened your talent. You have not seen the truth of this world. Don’t resist your inspiration, the son of heaven. I can see that the goddess’ light is full. Your body, the real awakening is only a matter of time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then she turned her head and said, "Do you feel it? The goddess is because of our encounter. Feeling happy, the inexpressible energy is filling my body, the revenge dragon rises up, and the burning black dragon has absolute deity..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge looked at the god of the Virginia with a strange look, at this time he has completely confirmed, this is a standard second-level knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the problems of the world view, she is somewhat confused about reality and fantasy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The ultimate justice will be fully implemented in my hands, and the light that runs through the heavens and the earth will dispel all the haze in the world, and sprinkle radiance and purity on the earth." Finally, Vegniya’s eyes were shining, and her face was red and swallowing, as if she had just climaxed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough, although it is not very good to interrupt you, but I still have other things to deal with." Su Ge said, turned and said to Ada: "Do you want to go back?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ada shook his head: "There is nothing to remember here. I have felt enough pleasure here. In good faith, I plan to go somewhere else."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge listened to silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But I really can't bear you." Ada raised his hand and stroked Su Ge's face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear did not feel any touch when he heard this, because he could not see the concerns and warmth of the past in Ada’s eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ida’s mouth tilted slightly and said: “Because you are the first person who can lie to me in the past five years! You know when you came back in the middle of the night. How shocked, how happy I was when I lie to me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge heard a shock in his heart and whispered: "You know what I am and the sect of death..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ada laughs even more brilliantly: "I know But I didn't stop it at the time. To be honest, during the past two years, I have experienced enough pleasure and good thoughts in your body. I was planning to leave you and find the next person. But suddenly Come back, you let me see that since there is a different existence, because you, let me see that my law is still flawed, I have been trying to make up for it for a few months, but because of your lying again and again, let me myself I am lost in confusion. But I just wanted to open it. Today's world does not allow perfect existence. Then I need to present my method and I need a weakness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "So the kind little guy, you will become my weakness to hide here!" Speaking of this, Ada held Sug's neck and lifted his foot and kissed him on his forehead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Getting a kiss from a saint, but a blessing!" Ada said, and the body turned into an endless light, like a myriad of stars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪嗒! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of such a scene, everyone present, including Luke, all rose three points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is she?!" Adeline was pale and caught in a huge self-contradictory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After touching Su Ge, she found that she encountered something more and more beyond her imagination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hills reached out to the glory and muttered, "I can't feel her heart."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The devil from the abyss, you feel not wrong." Vegniya’s voice suddenly came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Devil from the Abyss!!" Hills looked at her with her eyes open, and her head was not able to return to God for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vignia is the only person in the world at this time, she looked around and said: "She told me a lot along the way, I felt her Glorious, then determined my determination and belief, and she also briefly told her about her existence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ada, who is it?" Sug turned to stare at her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vignia does not sell off, directly said: "I can't say much, some things can only be heard by my current vision, can't Say. There is only one that can tell you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Say!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is a Sage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sage?" Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Luke on the side suddenly said: "That's what it says."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" You know?" Adeline hurriedly asked. Luke touched his chin and said: "There are many mysterious occupations in the world. There are certain special occupations in this diverse and diverse profession. This profession represents Some people, or someone else's inheritance alone. There is usually only one person in this profession."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know, this is a secret profession." Lin said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luke continues: "And above these professions, there are some very special professions. We all know that the so-called profession is actually exploring knowledge. The roads and methods, in the final analysis, count as our tools for exploring knowledge, just like the difference machine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But there is a profession that is not used to explore knowledge. !! When it comes to this, Luke’s voice suddenly increases. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spirit of Su Ge was immediately attracted to the past and asked: "What occupation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luke shake Shake his head: "There is no fixed title for that position, because the number is very small. You ask me what kind of occupation, I can't tell."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Then tell me, what kind of career is used for!" Su Ge immediately asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luke took a deep breath and looked up at the moon in the sky and said, "The profession is used to make great achievements or legends."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
