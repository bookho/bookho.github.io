			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know Yugo Sotos?" Su Ge sorted out his thoughts and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big eyed nodded: "I certainly know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Where is He now? What does He look like?" Su Ge breathed quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relationship between one's own name and that one has always been a mystery, but the omnipresent omnipotent god is too hidden and mysterious. The names of Satos and Mori's black goats have appeared one after another, but the name of Yog Sotos has still not been heard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time I heard the name here, Su Ge must catch it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of two questions raised at the same time, the big eyes were silent for one second, and then answered: "Yug Sotos is not dead."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug has some helplessness and asks: "Sug Sotos and You What is the relationship between Ge Sotos?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Big eyes heard this and carefully looked at Su Ge and replied: "Yug Sotos did not Death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge heard that there was a sign of vomiting blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big eyeball turns around and says, "I will continue to sleep, otherwise Byron will rise from the abyss."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, there is no farewell, or even a chance to speak to Su Ge, the whole dream is scattered like a tide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s own power is rapidly disappearing, and he knows that he is about to wake up from this dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a pity that I hope there will be opportunities in the future." Su Ge’s heart burst into tears and woke up from the dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened?" The giant sitting on the throne of the giant sacrum suddenly frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the bottom of the hall full of moss and bacteria blankets, standing some people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the left side stood ten people who were imaginary and could not see the figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the right side stood almost twenty people, all of them were hunters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leading is a hunter with five eyes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Father, what happened?" asked one of them like a ghost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant stood up and said, "He wakes up early and finds that we put those people in the city of Byron, spit them out of Byron, and both Spitting in the palace."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He plans to be perfect, in the face of these people, do not need to show too much strength, because they are Prepare to deal with more powerful enemies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the sacred relics, they link to the abyss and connect the ancient Byron city that has been sunk in the abyss dream to the inner side of the inner city. Below the entire city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After seduce those people into the inner world, they will be driven into the cursed ancient city through Shugus, not only to completely fight the coalition’s lineup. Disperse and separate, while killing them when they are asleep, to save more combat power to deal with outside reinforcements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the skull link, the giant has repeatedly confirmed that the presence of the caretaker Byron City has fallen into deep sleep, that level of sleep, as long as no one Come and snatch the control of Byron City, and you will not let the one wake up if you do anything inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are not saying that He is sleeping at the deepest level, and will not wake up in the next few hundred years!?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking is the five-eyed hunter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He spoke very clearly, and even clearly felt his anger at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because there, six teams were recruited to collect the "inner eye" they needed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But with which one wakes up, the whole plan is completely ruined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hunter’s advantage is the way in which they fit together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when the one was awake, it made everyone undisturbed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the configurations of those hunters are split. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is no overall cooperation, there will be no spells, and the hunters with low IQ will be weaker than the average mystery of the same level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has no advantage at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four faces of the giant are calm and plain, saying: "The emperor has entered a new existence, but there is still a certain distance from the real god." How the gods are not what we can speculate, the only thing the emperor can do is to estimate the possibility."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people are big people, five The eye hunter knows that it is meaningless to argue now and add responsibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he said indifferently: "All of them must be killed as soon as possible, and one cannot stay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The giant slightly decapitated, said high above: "Children, help our allies, kill all the enemies, it is time for these people to see the true power of our Byron Dias."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear this, the ghostly presences standing below are cheering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have long planned to kill all the foreigners, but the father is not allowed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now hearing this order, they immediately excited them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"More sacrifices are needed, children, start our feast."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After saying that the ten erratic figures disappeared instantly, just like moving in an instant, you can't see any traces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open your eyes, Sug found himself sitting in a dilapidated box On the side, there are many dead bodies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you awake?" A familiar voice came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge listened to a glimpse, turned his head and looked at it, and found that he was standing next to him, it was a wolf-blood warrior, Andrew. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How are you here?" Su Ge looked awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrew listened to a big sword and asked, "How are you here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where is this?" Su Ge looked around and found himself not inside the outer city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrew said: "This is the inner city, the periphery of the palace."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge listened Hey, suddenly looked up and found that Andrew was no longer on the bell tower, and was standing in a very dirty and narrow alley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can I appear here?" Su Ge asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andr shakes his head: "Where do I know, when I was just preparing to go to the palace from that passage, I suddenly saw you lying here, there are two variations around me. The residents want to eat you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge sorts out his thoughts and turns to find that Erha is not by his side, it seems that he has been thoroughly from the dream Wake up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How did you leave the clock tower?" Su Ge asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andu squeezed the hilt, and the tone was full of indifference: "The ceremony has begun. Six hours ago, the most sensible in the city. People are already crazy. Since they have become monsters, there is no need to continue to guard them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge listened and patted him on the shoulder: "Don't be too self-blaming, this is not your problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrew smiled freely: "I am used to it." I am just a warrior, I will not do anything but kill the enemy. I am not a doctor, not a priest, not a hero. For these people, guarding them to the end has already represented my will and mentality. After all, all I can do is Two things, the first thing is to watch them go crazy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stop, his eyes with a quirky expression: "Second Just kill them after they become monsters."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After hearing this, Su Ge couldn’t help but tremble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at Andrew's free and easy look, through his clear eyes, Su Ge could see some softness and helplessness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn’t know how much despair and helpless Andrew has experienced in tempering such a mentality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he knows that the experience must be accompanied by the pain of heartbreaking and the great struggle and mental torture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, Andrew turned and looked forward along the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the distance you can see towering walls and tall buildings behind the walls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the royal palace of Byron Dias. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am going to the palace to take the skull back and end the farce," Andrew said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge seriously said: "Are you sure you can complete this mission? The enemies there are beyond your imagination."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Andrew calmly replied: "This is my mission. This is my responsibility to bear the blood of the wolf."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Whether Do you know the dead road ahead?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andu nodded: "All those who join the Wolf Blood Legion are destined to die. I told you, I don't care when I die, how to die. I Just care what I am doing when I die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
