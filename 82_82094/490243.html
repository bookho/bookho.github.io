			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opening of the sound wave allowed Su Ge to discover a whole new world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resonance and conduction, these two keywords perfectly summarize the characteristics of the late bells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it is the spiritual power of the soul, the psionic sound that is transmitted through the psionic energy, the characteristic of this sound is strong resonance and conductivity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug recalls the battle he has come all the way through, and he finds that his late bell sound can almost resonate with any matter, and has almost no 100% penetration without any loss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most substances do not prevent the spread of the bells of the late bells, and due to the ripples of the psionic energy, such vibrations are not lost and destroyed by conduction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As long as Su Ge has enough powerful psionic power and continues to provide it, this heavy bell can even be passed to every corner of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the premise is that Su Ge has unlimited psionic power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It turns out!" Su Ge suddenly remembered the mysterious man mentioned in "The Evening Clock of Glen". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bell of the night bell declares the coming of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then his bell must be able to spread anywhere in the world, so that He can easily reach that level. The words of the Great God, then he is the bell itself, so that wherever the bell is, He can appear instantly from the bell!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Su Ge I remembered the record of Him in The Evening Clock of Glen:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the filthy things flooded the world, the bells would come out of the valley. Its long ripples will pass to the world, and all those who hear the sound of the late bell will meet the death on the third day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not resist, release your soul, this is your glory. The death of 汝 is the gospel of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has been with the night clock for countless years, and there is nothing to learn, and there is nothing to understand. The bell is his body, the ripple is his blade, and death is his armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The original is the case! The essence of the bell is actually hidden in the first few pages of the book." Turned and ran into the carriage, Su Ge Take the book out and touch the two pages of the hand. (Look, I write books so rigorously!)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rough hand is passed over, giving a special feel and bulge, like a bell The ripples are the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Resonance...penetration, ripples, bells, sharp edges." Su Ge’s head began to spin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking for a long time, Su Ge walked out of the camp alone, and even Luobo did not take the hillside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? He went up the mountain himself!? No one took it!?" Sapir heard this look shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deputy bishop, Childe nodded, "Yes, on his own, none of his dogs."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sapir silenced, clenched his fist and said: "Hold him! There are only two kinds of situations in this kind of person. One is a waste. Since it is not waste, it is very difficult to exist. This time. The Holy Grail documents in the ancient city are inevitable!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understand!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cure the church at the same time Horace also had the same idea, and he sent directly to Jenny, who is also a bishop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the back of Jenny’s departure, Horace’s eyes were filled with haze and indifference, and the little girl of the Soro family grew too fast, now Threatened his status. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, one of his purposes is to let this little girl die in an accident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sug Sotos is a killer in itself, and she is sure that she will be irritated by Su Ge, the most ideal one. The situation is that Su Ge killed her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he said, his bishop showed a hint of sarcasm: "She is also stupid, let her go, it is really obedient, after all, it is still too young."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge alone One person walked silently on the hillside, and took a fist-sized stone as he passed by. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stone is held in the hand and the bell is heard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately, the whole stone began to tremble quickly, but after a few seconds, it became a lime and was scattered around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black cloak automatically lifts the corner to cover the mouth and nose of Su Ge, very dedicated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After watching the dust flying in the distance, Su Ge’s bell spread again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The invisible bell immediately resonated with the air and fly ash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fly ash suddenly formed a fuzzy ripple like a dragonfly in the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dissipating the bell, Su Ge nodded with satisfaction and went on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After about a hundred meters, I walked into the woods full of conifers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge casually found an adult thigh thick pine tree to go over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking out on the trunk, the bells are passed in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, the whole tree began to tremble violently, making people look as if the eyes were blurred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The massive leaves fell, and the black cloak soared up, forming a square curtain that blocked the Su Ge head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge seems to be looking for something with his eyes closed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After five or six seconds, hey!咔嚓......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a burst of crisp sound, the trunk of the pine tree is suddenly broken and blasted, as if the rotten trunk was blown out from the middle, crumbs , fiber, fried everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sonic blasting seems to have some feelings." Su Ge’s mouth showed a smile and was very happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time he is testing the possibility of a late bell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stone and the tree he just passed the bell into it, but the control did not pass it out, but the kinetic energy was gradually stored and accumulated to a certain level. Exploded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time was a failure, because there was no control, and the violent vibration shook the structure of the stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second time, barely counted as success. Su Ge actually intended to carry out precise control, let it blast from the middle of the trunk, instead of letting the entire tree explode. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How come you?" At this moment, Su Ge asked. Not far away, Jenny walked out carefully, respectfully said: "The bishop sent me to follow you, just as the Nighthawk Church is also tracking, I It was solved smoothly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge heard a slight nod: "You master?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Well, adults are very important to my opening. I actually have enough before, but I can't get out of my heart, so I can't go any further." Jenny came to look more respectful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded with satisfaction: "That's good, perform well. Bishop, Archbishop, even the apostle, you have a chance. The Lord treats any people." Absolutely equal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jenny nodded hard: "Yes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It still needs to be installed. You will continue to follow it. By the way, help me deal with the situation around me. I am too lazy to pay attention."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge said, black Like a close-knit maid, the cloak quickly smashed the wood chips and fibers from Su Ge's body and then returned to a normal cloak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The side of Jenny looked at the heart bursting, she already felt that this cloak is at least a five-level secret treasure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the cloak has a sense of self, this is the hallmark of the five-level secret treasure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, what shocked her was not only the secret treasure, but the attitude of this secret treasure to Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five-level secret treasure has so far been tamed, most of them are as delicious as the uncle, and you need to look at the secret treasure when you need it. How is the mood? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the sacrifice of blood that was stolen some time ago, not only the blood of the host, but also the blood consumption of the supplement more than ten times each time. blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't mean the existence of my main consciousness!" Jenny was more awesome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While Jenny meditated, Su Ge, who was walking ahead, exploded two more trees. However, it can be seen that under the control of Su Ge, the scope of the irregular explosion is getting smaller and smaller, and the explosion is getting more and more accurate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At dusk, Su Ge’s face came down slightly from the hillside . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the afternoon, his vast amount of psionic power has been consumed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As soon as he passed, Su Ge tapped a stone with his cane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, these stones either blast directly, either directly, or directly into lime. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just this afternoon, Su Ge’s progress is very obvious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound wave pointed out the direction is very correct, now his knowledge is like a bare trunk, Su Ge has completely grasped the trunk, the rest It is to let the trunk grow out of branches, branches and leaves, extending from the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In just one afternoon, he put all his energy into the two aspects of the penetration and accumulation of vibration, the core of which is control and transformation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because already has a good foundation, the experimental results of Su Ge's road are very good and very obvious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back at the camp, Jenny quietly returned to the church's camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nighthawk Church spy, after being knocked out by Jenny, was brought back at dusk, and has not yet woken up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The campsite in the northeast corner has been built. There are four square tents, four of which are the same size, and the beds and bedding are ready. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The campfire in the middle camp, as well as the associated seats, barbecues, and tables were also placed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dinner is ready, and nine people are waiting for Su Ge around the campfire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let everyone wait, start!" Su Ge smiled and sat down, first throwing Lobo a long bone bone that had already been prepared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic ate ​​a barbecue and whispered, "What about the matter, what are you going to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The sound wave is very suffocating, the location of the frost is only 20 meters away from her, even her faint can feel the familiar psionic fluctuations, but she is sitting very stable, her expression is very light, no slightest impatience . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge wiped his mouth and said casually: "First determine the position, then look at her cage and her personal circumstances."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The curtains around them are specially treated, and my sound detection is completely useless," said the sound wave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug did not do it: "Since it is made of mysterious insulation, my ability is even more in vain. Wait, I will let people handle this at night. Things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic looked at Su Ge and did not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dinner ended in a calm atmosphere, and the two churches did not come to Suge to discuss anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After dispatching a good patrol, Su Ge was lying in a tent and entering a dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
