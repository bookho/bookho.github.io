			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Ron screamed with open arms, a large number of priests from the Church of the Holy Blood appeared in the shadows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lot of clerics whom Su Ge knows, including the Gaelic sergeant who has broken his arm, the deputy bishop Laurin, the nun who manages the warehouse, and even Instructors who teach Su Ge training and firearms training, etc., clergy and ordinary church personnel, together with more than fifty people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are smiles in the past, and my kindly colleagues are now madly raising their hands around the Basilica of the Holy Blood, full of strange fanaticism. Open your mouth and scream insanely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the distance, Clausen and Luke played evenly and hardly, and Adeline’s battle with the obese man was in a difficult battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mysterious power of this man is electric current, and at this time he actually holds the secret treasure of Bishop Ron: Lei Zhi, very difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the water is insulated, it is not insulated after being summoned to become contaminated with impurities, which makes Aideline very passive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Adeline is not in a hurry. She knows her task is to drag the small fish and shrimps, waiting for the Pope’s decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your Pope has been pinched to death by Ron? Do you have any expectations for him?" Obese middle-aged people think they win. In the grip, asked with a smirk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adeline responded in a quiet voice: "The fat pig on your brain is estimated to think about two minutes later, two points zero. I don’t understand things after a second, and naturally I don’t understand my foresight.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “It’s really like a rumor, it’s really a tip of the mouth, for a while I will tear your mouth, I hope that you can still be so embarrassed at that time!" Middle-aged people know that they said that Adeline, silently began to attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Adeline was in a tough fight, the second-ever metamorphosis knight, Vegginia, took the game with Hills and Bonice, and now The ghouls around are almost annihilated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you need our help to master the waters of the nightmare?" Vegginia gasped and asked Adeline. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hills and Bernice both licked their mouths and rushed straight to attack obese men without speaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey! We are all overlord in the future, we must communicate more!" Vegginia rushed up with a big sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not far away, Luke looked at his wounds and sighed helplessly: "Since we can't solve each other, can we rest for a while?" What's the look like? Your task is to drag me down? Big deal, I won't shoot, OK?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This proposal just cuts the heart of Clausen, I nodded in agreement and said, "I think so. I have time to hide in the kitchen to make a la carte, cook a cup of coffee, and how good it is to swim. I have to kill him here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luke swears: "I am not interested in these two things. I prefer women, especially those who have been married for several years and are single-handed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the interests are different, but the two people have surprisingly reached an agreement, and at the same time began to fish in the water, it is to look like, but to talk about the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why are you helping the kid? The kid is a little special, but it doesn't help you!" Clawson asked casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luke thought about it and replied: "Have you heard his bell?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "The bell?" Clawson looked at him and said, "I don't like the bell. It reminds me of some bad things in ancient times."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there an extinction about "Wang"?" Luke’s eyes flashed with brilliance, and he asked temptedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauson’s attitude suddenly cooled down, like a change of one person: “Little guy, your curiosity is too heavy.”<br /><br </ </ /> </ /> </ /> ;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard the fish, Clausen returned to normal, and he continued to smile...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咕噜噜噜...<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden and indescribable voice in the black mud of the squad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, a dark crack appeared in the sky above the Cathedral of the Holy Blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crack is like a crack in the sky, through the crack, people can see countless twisted stars and nebulae, and an indescribable The horror of the atmosphere whistled from it and swept the entire array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first of them is the general communicators under Ron’s men. When they feel the breath, they instantly twist their eyes, and they bleed and the body twists into A scary angle, huddled on the ground and died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This breath is very scary, the moment when the people fighting here are swept away, everyone is scared to the ground, and his heart is pale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking up, just to see the deep chilling fear of the gradual enlargement, and finally occupied the entire city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The great Mori Black Goat!" Ron on the ground has a big eyes and a sultry fanaticism. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The great Mori Black Goat!" Others followed, as if they had lost their shackles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the crack has grown to its limit, countless black things have fallen from the sky into the black mud on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like a lake that flows into the ground like a black waterfall flowing down the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these black things flowing in, the giant worms around them suddenly swayed, as if they felt something, summoning them, and soothing them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black things flow for about ten seconds, and disappear suddenly as the red in the sky fades back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the portal loses energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this ten seconds is enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the injection of black matter, the black mud on the ground gradually solidified, as if it had changed from a liquid to a solid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the volume gradually shrinks, revealing a myriad of disgusting black tentacles and awkward mouths. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mucus that looks like a goat's mouth is so low that it falls down the corner of the mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge body gradually shrinks and becomes a disgusting, full-mouth, tentacle disgusting monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to be a disgusting monster piled up by the tentacles of countless octopuses and the mouth of a goat. It is seen that there is an indescribable fear that haunts the heart. Destroy people's reason and wisdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at this time the original system of the entire space seems to have completely collapsed, and everyone only feels fear while looking directly at this horrible existence, and there is no There are signs of a sharp rise and madness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is...this is!" Adeline stared at the things with her eyes wide open, and all the knowledge in her head was constantly tumbling, but she could not find any trace of energy. Corresponding to something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luke and Clausen, who have more strength, are now shocked and their faces are dignified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because they gradually felt that the mystery of them was disappearing quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not that someone has absorbed their power, but that the power rules of this space have been completely rewritten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the source, because of His coming! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their knowledge is not suitable for this new space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咩咩喵嗷嗷...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weird calls resound throughout the space, yet due to the world The rewriting of the rules, the people heard the strange cry but did not have much feeling, only felt a slight dizziness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
