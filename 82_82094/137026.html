			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at these six wolf knights with terrorist pressure, Adeline endured the inner shock and the faint fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because from the appearance of these six wolf knights, her control of this dream world began to be infinitely suppressed, just as this dream world does not belong to her. same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My Lord... These six wolf knights are just messengers! Only the messenger has such a terrible power, then the one behind..." think of this Adeline swallowed a hard mouth, but she was gradually excited when she was in fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because, if that one is really as Suge said, it means that he has the power to restore Jerome's feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The side of Griman pinched his old palm, continually recited the prayers of his own beliefs and found that he could not stop his soul from shaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn! Why didn't you say that there was such a terrible existence here when the invitation was invited?? Isn't this pulling us into the abyss?" Glyman couldn't help but have a strong complaint and even resentment against the invitee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hulala...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A shrill chain suddenly sounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they returned to God, they found that six wolf cavalry handcuffs tied their bodies with heavy chains, and then they took prisoners of war. Just take off and take off to the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adeline looked at her body as a prisoner, with a slight complaint: "Is this the invitation that Soge said? Unique."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a dizzying gray world, six people found themselves standing on the deck of an ancient battleship after a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This warship has been incomparable for a long time, and there are traces of the years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battleship is surrounded by a horrible blizzard (note!!), so that they can not see the situation outside the warship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where is this?" The crowd looked at this huge ice warship, and the spirit had not returned to God, instinct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thick, distant bells slowly spread. The bells just like the morning bells and drums suddenly knocked on their chaos, and the mind gradually recovered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up in the bell and they saw themselves standing in front of a huge dark temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the temple door was open, and there were two rows of armor on the side of the gate, and the bodyguards were full of terror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These guards are dressed like wolf cavalry, but they are not riding a wolf at this time, but standing like a statue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it here..." The stars of the Institute of Polar Studies suddenly thought of something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Quiet!" Just as the six people whispered, a stern and heavy voice suddenly came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sound has tremendous power, allowing six people to breathe at the same time, and the whole spirit is blank, as if the whole mind was cut off by this voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, everyone only heard one voice, like the sound of two porcelains gently hitting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sound is coming from their mouths, the chin trembles, the sound of teeth striking, this is the voice that represents fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound came again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pump! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without any hesitation, there was no resistance, and six people, including Adeline and Earl, instantly fell down, as if the voice could not resist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tall and tall female warrior came out, the golden eyes under the mask with indifference, and the same voice as just: "People, your faith, no What kind of posture should you teach you when you face the true God?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;! ! ! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having heard this, the brains of six people were instantly blank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"True God? What is God? What is the true God...God! God!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In two After a second, Gryman and other four expert mysteries were overwhelmed by fear and overwhelming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Master Adeline barely keeps his mind, and his heart is filled with excitement while the soul is shaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl's eyes are filled with an indescribable brilliance, and he is respectfully kneeling on the ground, his posture and appearance are the most devout. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A heavy voice came out of the temple, it seemed that the heavy scepter hit the ground, and the thick voice was coming out A strong echo, not long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The oppressed by this voice, the six people completely collapsed and squatted directly on the ground, their faces were full of horror and fear, and the body could not help but scream trembling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"¥#%##&amp;&amp;##%" magnificent, long, solemn, sacred, horrible... the moment of hearing this sound, six people There are countless description vocabulary in my mind, but these words cannot describe the attributes of this sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not that these words are not precise enough, but that they are not qualified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The human language can no longer describe this voice, and human thinking can no longer understand this voice! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In this world, is there really a true God that can be revealed on its own!?" Hearing this voice, Glyman felt that he was taught from an early age. The knowledge is completely subverted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because they were educated from an early age, the real gods will not appear in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are all false gods and those who artificially create monsters from the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, the characteristics of this gas field, this kind of pressure, this indescribable sound, etc., confirm all the conditions and memories of the gods in their memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All gods are high-level beings that we humans cannot understand. We must be superfluous and grateful for our gods' fears and fears. Remember to treat gods. Four Principles: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His name cannot be remembered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice cannot be imitated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His form cannot be seen directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His existence is indescribable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪嗒! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unable to understand the sound, Adeline found that his vision rose seven points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The count found his own vision to rise three points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the weaker Grimman four people, the vision of the sky suddenly rose 20 points! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The insane and screaming screams came from the mouths of four people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can see that these four strengths are only expert-level mystery. At this moment, the eyes are extremely turbid, the mouth is drooling, the expression is distorted, like a crazy madman. same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they are mad and yelling at this time, the instinct is still on the ground, afraid to have irregular actions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the bark, the four knights stepped forward, grabbed four people, turned and threw them directly out of the ship, drowning in the blizzard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is unexpectedly listening to his new language. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
