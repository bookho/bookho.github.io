			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For this book, Su Ge did not continue to read. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see these things today, his heart has been greatly shocked, and even the spirit feels tired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you continue to read it, it is easy to cause some mental problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More critically, Su Ge believes that there must be a more horrific existence behind it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of the strange planet or the reminder of the blood of Byron’s great son, it is faintly letting Sog know that their way forward is waiting for them. Unspeakable terror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be careful to put away the book, Su Ge took a deep breath and let his heart completely calm down through the night of the soul of the town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, it's time to deal with the second thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, Su Ge turned and walked into the villa to find Duke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the separate living room, the big room is only Su Ge, Duke, and Steven. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can I really join the religion of the Great Lord?" Duke asked excitedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly: "The Lord of Great agrees with your will, but you still need to pay enough sincerity."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You please say!" Duke looked at Su Ge with his eyes in his eyes, his face full of hopes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge calmly asked: "Do you know the female warlock?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course, yes The church is chasing the heresy. But, in my opinion, these intellectually beautiful women are not heresy, but a group of social elites full of knowledge and wisdom." Duke expressed his views. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly: "I saved four female warlocks from the Church of the Holy Blood last night."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Four female warlocks!? From the Church of the Holy Blood?" Hearing this, the two people were full of horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, now the four female warlocks are in my cousin's home. This is inconvenient and unsafe. I need you to help me settle and hide. These four female warlocks." Su Ge said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Duke did not answer immediately, feeling chin in his thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not a fool, he is very aware of the dangers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Blood Church is very aware of the heresy and the means of sheltering heresy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you agree to Su Ge, it means that Duke completely tied himself to Su Ge, and then it was a grasshopper on a rope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Stephen’s temptation said: “Mr. Black Mist, this...the risk seems to be a bit big. We are all ordinary people, if those female warlocks suddenly go crazy, we There is no room for resilience."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke nodded slightly and looked at Su Ge and said, "Mr. Black Mist, you need to give me a safe guarantee. As you have mentioned before, the self-discipline and self-discipline will protect other people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge heard this look happy and opened his mouth: "Duke, you can be so skilled in understanding our teachings and make me very happy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke smiled: "Because I like your church very much." The doctrine of these two days has been elusive for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug is nodded with satisfaction: "Very good, I know your worry very well. If you are like this If I rush to agree, I will doubt your motives and thoughts. Now, you can really win the favor of my master."<br /><br />& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke hurriedly thanked: "Thank you for your affirmation and approval."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Step by step carefully asked: "That Mr. Black Mist, what other methods do you have?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge leaned on the sofa and lifted his legs, said: "Of course, I can give You are a safe guarantee, and you can even give your absolute peace of mind to contact with the female warlocks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You please say." Duke respectfully said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge sat up straight and solemnly said: "Tonight, I will let the people of our church send four female nurses and stay to protect you." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke did not speak, this method did not give him peace of mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge looked directly into his eyes and said with deep eyes like an abyss: "Then, your master and servant will be qualified to enter the kingdom of my Lord. Seeing the gods of my Lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;! ! ! ! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, the two people shuddered and shook. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shenguo, Shenwei! Hearing these two words has already made them indescribable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke is so hard to swallow his mouth and ask: "You mean...we can enter the kingdom of the great Lord? Close contact with a god ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, this evening, after the two of you enter the dream, my Lord’s knight will cross the world of dreams and bring you both to my god. Country."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pump! thump! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two people suddenly felt the heartbeat speeding, dry mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The older Stephen was relatively mature, and at this time he respectfully asked: "The young master and I still don't know the priesthood and title of the great pillar."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge took a deep breath and said solemnly: "That's good, my Lord is the Lord of Storm and Death, the only true God of the Valley and the Abyss, the rule of dreams." The dominator of death, the master of the fog."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this series of names, listening to it is death, it’s a storm, it’s The key words of dreams, two people instantly feel the brain short circuit, some reactions are not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, Duke recalls the reassuring fog of the past, the bells of inner peace, and the power to shelter himself in a nightmare. In his heart, he believed in the great god, seven points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
