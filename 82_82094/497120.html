			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to the camp, Su Ge’s potion effect faded, watching the sullen, pale-faced Su Ge, Sapir and Horace brows locked . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The side of Hills has simply said the experience of two people just now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The monster has a strong mysterious resistance and can pollute the human spirit and can carry out a medium-range jet attack."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about the body?" Sapir asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge said: "There are other people, I was exhausted and I didn't have time to study the body."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting up under the help of Hills, Su Ge went outside the camp: "The intelligence has been brought, the two conductors will be well equipped!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The present is not what Su Ge looks like. After the potion effect has passed, the spirit is dry and exhausted. He wants to sleep well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s hard." Jenny and Childe came over and said seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded and walked out of the camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This information is very important, we must pay attention to it." Horace said seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sapier nodded: "So get ready now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rest in Suger At the same time, a battle is taking place between the distant cliffs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touch! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a tight-fitting suit, Randall with a mask, the fist in his hand punched the glaring lightsaber. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This punch has broken the light on the lightsaber by half, and Joel holding the lightsaber has stepped back several times, his face is gloomy. Like water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside him, the eight followers have already died five, leaving only three. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These five people died very badly, some fell into the trap and the whole body was pierced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of them were broken by the filaments, some were frozen half of the body, and then broken...<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up slightly into the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a man on the stone who is dressed in a hunter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a silver-white wolf head mask and couldn’t see it, only a pair of eyes burning with wildfires revealed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Behind this blazing sword, sitting calmly at this moment, holding an ice crystal longbow in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man did not shoot, but the distance still made him feel a bitter cold, like a very sharp ice thorn, hanging on him The top of the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"High vampire! Why do you want to help the female warlock!?" Joel asked gloomyly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just found a few female warlocks in the vicinity, and there seems to be the female warlock who was rescued by the bishop of the Holy Blood Church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately rushed over to try to catch it back, but he encountered these two killings when he was about to succeed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On combat effectiveness, he is not afraid of high vampires. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the high vampires are powerful, their promotion is very slow and has many weaknesses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This vampire is also a master. He uses his own lightsaber to match his knowledge and can easily surrender him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, what he did not expect was that this higher vampire had undergone tremendous variation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not only are there many weaknesses, but they are far beyond the limits of the master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Randall did not answer, bent over and reached for the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be careful!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joer yelled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it is still late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I only felt a strange shadow flashing past, and then the huge ghost wolf suddenly rushed out from under the ground, biting a waiter's waist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Glory Binding!" Joel immediately screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A white silk thread appeared instantly, entangled in this giant wolf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, at the moment of being entangled, the giant wolf directly turned into a mist, and disappeared in the blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the wolf is gone, but the bloody mouth has left a huge trauma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mystery who is blood is looking to die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other mysterious person flashed a soft glow in his hands at the crucial moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When these radiances landed on the injured mystery, the scary wounds healed at a speed visible to the naked eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, although not completely healed, at least he recovered some of his mobility and saved his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The expert priest is indeed annoying." Randall said, a lot of dark bats appeared behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joel pinches his arms and takes a deep breath: "If you want to break out the war between the Hearst family and the Glorious Church, you can continue to do it now." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are threatening me?" Randall's eyes flashed red and his voice was low and scary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joel swallowed his mouth and nervously said: "This is a fact."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rand After listening to it, it seems to have fallen into meditation. For a moment, he said: "Give up the tracking of the female warlock and roll back to your camp. I will spare you a life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Although Joel was very reluctant, but his life was tight, he immediately nodded: "Well, I swear by the god of glory, not to follow those female warlocks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;兰Del faintly said: "Go it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then Joel fled with only the remaining three people turned around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss came over and asked, "How did you kill?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our purpose is In order to protect the female warlock from leaving, it doesn't matter if my family can't open the war, mainly because adults need their lives," Randall said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss thought of the results of the two men’s investigations these days, nodded slightly: “Really, letting them die in the city is more valuable than dying here.” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Today, discuss with the adults about rescue measures," Randall said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss looked up at the fog on the mountain: "I can think of some plans for the clock people. We just need to wait." Brd/><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Randall nodded and looked at Jellos and asked, "Do you really want to go up and see?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerlos smiled: "Not too late, when Su Ge needs me, I will go up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug Go to the camp and the sound wave to sleep two sentences, then enter the dream to summarize the results of the experiment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After deep learning, Su Ge felt that he had touched the ceiling and only needed an opportunity, an opportunity to integrate everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he analyzed the form of Shirley and what she said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This woman is not a human being. Her body includes something that makes me feel familiar. It is unclear and unclear. The key is under the mask. Or in her body. If there is a chance for the body to be in close contact with her, then she will know what is in her body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can make the body of the body impulsive, which has exceeded the normal non-human level and entered a new form. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The bureau she said should be the sacrifice with the soul of the Holy Grail as the core, and the score of my analysis is not bad. The so-called eye god is just a waste. It has to appear in front of me, I can pinch it with one hand. The core problem of arresting so many people is that the so-called god of the eye does not enter the realm of the god, but is stuck in a very embarrassing situation. The position of the hunter is based on the eye as the level, and those who are taken away should all have special eyes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And these eyes, It is the so-called big god who wants to further nourish the nutrients, or the key to glimpse more knowledge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Sugnar’s divergent connected thinking suddenly I thought that he had seen an ancient book: "The Sea of ​​Knowledge - Kabatos." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The book records that people there can see more knowledge by getting more eyes. It seems that the so-called city of disasters and the three churches Out of the same door, they all got away from Kabatos College."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Su Ge’s mouth showed a sneer: "The messenger of the Lord in the city of trouble is in In the city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later, Randall entered the dream and Su Ge said something about the Glorious Church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This kid is really not dead, the female warlocks are already safe?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After helping the two men, Jelos was safe for them, and let Pete take them out quickly with them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a encounter with Joel when he left, and there was a daytime battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's already safe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tomorrow cold church to come to camp, Sapir should With the back hand, you can look away from it. If they succeed, grab the frost back. If it fails, don't shoot it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the command, Su Ge was a little tired, and then withdrew from the dream into deep sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge slept for twenty hours. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning at seven o'clock, he woke up in a noisy night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because, the fog finally dissipated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The washed Su Ge walked out of the tent and could clearly see the majestic city between the three peaks next to each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city is at least 800 meters above the ground, and the main body of the city is built on the ridges and slopes between the three peaks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire building looks unusually large and can be seen around the generous gray walls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire city wall encircles the entire top of the mountain, and through the walls you can see many towering buildings, including buildings, clock towers, churches, etc. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These buildings have a distinct retro Gothic style, and each building has a very slender spire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These spires come and go, and from here they look like hundreds of spires standing in the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the top of the three peaks, each has a towering dark blue castle, the style of the castle is consistent with the city, looks thick, magnificent, and has a high Towering spires. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My God, how was the city built?" The people standing at the foot of the mountain saw this scene and suddenly felt incredible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be aware that the ancient city of Yagu was first appeared about three hundred years ago, and finally died eighty years ago because of the landslide. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, there were no airships and spaceships that were so developed nowadays, so it was a god to build such a magnificent and exquisite building in such a high and so steep place. trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s strange that no soldiers can be seen on the observatory of the three castles in the city, and even a figure can’t be seen. Like a ghost town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
