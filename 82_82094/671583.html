			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dream of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eyeta and Duke are standing outside the shrine, looking at the magnificent buildings in front, the slow-moving battleship in the sky, feeling themselves The brain capacity is unable to handle everything that is seen at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contemplation, several people suddenly felt that the people beside them seemed to be getting more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turned around and found that a large number of well-dressed, elegant people appeared in the Kingdom of God, and then whispered to each other from the main entrance into the shrine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They can’t see the look of these people, but from that kind of manners and temperament, it can be seen that these people are all above the middle class, belonging to the whole The elite of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They just walked into the shrine, without the kind of pilgrimage they had imagined, and did not bow their heads, and they looked like they’re I went back to my home outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "These are the believers of my Lord." Cass's voice came from the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The six people heard this time, and squinted for a long time to return to God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This huge shrine is the lord of my Lord, the soul that has been redeemed in the fog in the distance, and the soul that has been redeemed. The battleship you just saw It’s just one of the many warships of my master...”” Kas is happy, and his tone is full of pride and pride. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several people nodded dullly, and destined to turn their brains to remember and digest this dreamy scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it’s all incredible and unimaginable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the mess, six people felt their heads open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a sacred, solemn, distant, and magnificent bell came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bell has a great power that cannot be described. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing the bell, the thoughts of the six people quickly calmed down, and the will and thoughts processed all the incredible messages accurately and effectively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I heard this bell." Duke said with excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iyeta also nodded: "On the boat, I heard this bell. It is He who redeemed us who fell into fear."<br />< Cas />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cass raised his hand and said, "That is the symbol of my Lord, the late bell. It is the boundary between life and death, the guide of the soul, the beacon of the abyss. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Kas's arm, several people looked up and saw that there was a dark bell on the tallest hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the moment of seeing the big clock, all the thoughts of the six people were attracted to him, and the whole person entered an absolute state of calm, like a precision. Calm robots in general. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜呜呜...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A burst of screams sounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke and others who entered absolute calmness looked up and saw that the majestic wolf knights had returned to the kingdom of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first ten of them, each with a chain of ice in their hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The end of the chain is tied to the female warlocks who have just been. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way to swing back and forth is very funny, like a fish that has been hoisted, and it seems to be a dead prey that comes back from hunting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wolf cavalry descended from the sky and laid down the four panicked female warlocks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These female warlocks suddenly showed the same appearance as Ieta and others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, knights, give them to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mature sounds It sounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone's gaze turned to look at the past, just to see a mature sexy woman wearing a blue flame robes, holding a long squat, can not see the appearance suddenly appeared in front of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Archbishop." Kas and the Cavaliers nodded slightly and did not salute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adeline nodded and said, "Cass, let's go first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Card Responseed to a huge temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a time, everyone’s eyes were attracted to Adeline. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cass is just an associate bishop, and in front of them is an archbishop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the archbishop seems to make them completely incomprehensible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Women Warlocks, you should feel honored."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white hair knight is high Said the voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This Archbishop of the Storm is a female warlock, remembering all the teachings of the Archbishop, is the first step in your redemption." , led the other knights turned into a group of fog disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When everyone heard this dream, the captured female warlock headed by Granger took the lead and squatted on the ground to express his obedience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iyeta and others followed and were stopped by Adeline. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You six can go straight in, the Pope is waiting for you." Adeline said, let the Bernie ribbon next to her lead six people Walk into the shrine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Pope’s majesty, six people were flattered and spirited and followed Bernice into the shrine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After they left, Adeline looked at the fourteen warlocks lying on the ground and said calmly: "I know Ms. Mei, she knows her well." Who is it, and know what kind of torture you have suffered. I explained this to my master, and my lord said that your actions can be forgiven."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon hearing this, the fourteen female warlocks trembled and slowly lowered their heads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The late bell church was founded to protect us from the few people who were suppressed by the worldly. Female warlocks, witches, vampires, undead people, etc. The world is called heresy, and those who are chased by the church can be sheltered in the church at night, and they can be peaceful in this country."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adeline said With open arms, the voice said softly: "So now, don't suppress your own suffering, don't be afraid of the torture you have suffered. In the future, here is your destination, the sacred place for your peace and redemption. You are the safest and warmest harbor. In the name of my lord, you can get redemption, and you can get a new life in this country."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Now release your heart and let everything be the past!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to these words, these female warlocks tremble more intensely, then they lie On the ground, the cries and sobbing faintly tried to suppress , A large number of tears fell on the dark land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These female warlocks, almost all of them have a hard time to look back, have suffered from Ms. Mei’s infernal training. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, when they heard these words, it seemed that the bullied girl returned home and returned to her father’s strong arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kind of grievance, the kind of pain, the kind of happiness, the sense of security knead together, letting these numb people crush the sluggish shackles , liberated the original true self. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No need to be patient, no fear, here is your destination, here is your home." Adeline's voice with a kind of let The irresentful love and kindness that man can't resist, like a gentle and kind mother comforting his children. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜呜呜...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing these words, these female warlocks can no longer control themselves The body is lying on the ground, crying and screaming, and people feel extremely distressed when they look at it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can’t imagine those female warlocks who are expressionless and murderous and blind, will cry like a child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boom! Boom! Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the sacred night bell sounded again, and the sky suddenly changed, and a burst of storm accompanied by thunder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This suddenly shook the body of these female warlocks, and the crying stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adelin softly appeased: "Don't be afraid, my wrath is not for you, but for those who make you painful."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, the female warlocks’ bodies shook and then looked up, and the cried red eyes looked at Adeline incredulously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adeline’s expression with admiration and piety, she said to the sky: “Look, unlike those false gods, my Lord is real, And my Lord will feel anger because of the encounter between His people and servants, and will manifest miracles because of our encounters, and ruin all the sinners."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; along Aideline's line of sight, everyone continues to look into the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;! ! ! ! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With thunder and storm, an unspeakable majestic figure stood in the sky overlooking the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment the female warlocks saw the figure, all the thoughts, the whole soul was filled with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are very aware of the invisible characteristics of the gods, but at this moment their instinct tells themselves that what they see now is a god! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hunting flying cloak, silver-gray armor, meteor-like rifle, mastering the storm and thundering posture, everything that declares this existence Identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is the ruler of this world, He is the true God of omnipotence! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adeline’s voice is full of ambiguity, happiness, pride, and worship: “Unlike other false gods, my Lord likes to get involved in the world. He is our God. Father, is our destination, and shelters the glory of our way forward."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the female warlocks squatted on the ground and put their hands together on their chests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the indescribable existence of the gods, they did not feel the fear at the moment, but felt a peace and calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because all of them have been completely conquered by that existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure occupies everything about them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, they only want to admire at His feet, become His people, and devote all their faith and piety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the rest, it has nothing to lose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time doesn't know how long it has been, the figure in the sky doesn't know when it has disappeared with thunder and storms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the female warlocks returned to God, they found that they had come to the temple, in a magnificent and large hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front, Iyeta, Duke and other six people face devout, standing respectfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a beautiful queen in front of them, wearing a crown and wearing a long skirt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment they swear, this is the most beautiful person they have ever seen in their lives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms. Mei is a shit compared to her! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Welcome to the church of the late bell!" Vanas was so proud, the cold voice rang in the empty hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the late bell rang and rang through the whole country of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourteen warlocks are pious and calm in their hearts, and they are like a person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are neatly kneeling on the ground, respectfully saying: "I am waiting for the female warlock, willing to dedicate everything to the great Lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
