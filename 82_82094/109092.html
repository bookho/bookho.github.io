			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frost battleship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge walked out of the temple and watched a total of twenty-nine golden souls outside, quietly here, respectful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s big hand waved, countless cold winds and frosts emerged, wrapping their souls, making them soldiers wearing heavy armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This way, my army will come more and more." Su Ge looked at the row of neat soldiers today, and his heart was full of satisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new warriors have been popularized by the old birds on the battleship when Su Ge was asleep, and seemed to be deeply brainwashed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if Su Ge doesn’t say a word, this group of undead is full of fanaticism. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg overlooked everyone and said: "Very good, my soldiers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The sound of a storm like the sound, accompanied by the sound of the bell, gives an indescribable supreme majesty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers armed with rifles slammed the chest armor of the steel armor, straighten the body, and looked solemn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A patrol, Su Ge’s eyes fell into the distant grey world of dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Forget it, wait a minute!" Su Ge is still very curious about the world, but he thinks he is not ready yet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At least wait for me to leave the apprenticeship and become a professional priest after researching and researching." Su Ge temporarily set himself a goal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back on the throne, Su Ge raised his hand slightly and hooked his finger at the invisible void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the storm to seal each other's connections, Su Ge can use their own theocracy to pull their consciousness directly into this space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the theocracy was launched, the two cold winds slowly condensed on the deck outside the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few seconds later, with a cold fog, two figures appeared on the deck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two men can still be seen as two people, Hills and Bernice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no big change between the two people at this time. Except for the ice-blue wolf head mark on the chest, only their faces were slightly changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This change is very strange, it looks like that, but because of some weird changes, the two people are like a person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hills’ eyes were a little smaller, and there were some ice-blue lines on the cheeks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corners of the lips are more prominent, and the face is slightly thinner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bennis’s Danfeng eyes are slightly larger, the bridge of the nose is slightly lower, and the corners of the lips are slightly raised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The combination of these subtle changes did not make two people look good, but it changed the overall look and temperament of the two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time the souls of the two men wore metal armor similar to the undead warriors, and the whole body was surrounded by biting cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second time I came here, the two people were obviously calmed down a lot. At this time, their demeanor is still pious, but there is a lot of fear on the face, and more calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come in!" Su Ge’s magnificent voice came from the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people sang and walked into the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After entering the door, he still squats in the last position, respectful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger sat on the high throne overlooking two people and found subtle changes in the appearance of two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not a change of appearance, but a change of will. There is a heart, a will determines the shape of the soul, and the soul determines the appearance of the body. Although the storm has been accepted, the character and will seem to be affected." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The line of sight swept over them and then fell on the sarcoma of their chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sarcoma has changed at this time. After being merged with the fog of the valley, their surfaces are covered with cold frost and become like ice cubes. The same organization. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This organization extends a large number of nerves and omentum that link the body of two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that my power is above these mysterious sarcoma levels, at least at this time these sarcomas have been covered by storm hunting."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the simple analysis, Su Ge said: "Very good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hills replied immediately after listening "Returning to my lord, thank you for your endless gift to us. I waited for the servant to be dull. After three days, I was barely able to withstand the boundless power that you gave."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge said faintly: "Continue to keep your piety."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes!" The two witches are filled with gratitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go!" Su Ge waved his hand after determining the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, the two witches turned into fog and disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I will confirm the physical condition of the two people tomorrow morning." Su Ge thought of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Green Flame Brotherhood is constantly lurking here, ready to do things. Su Ge needs a certain guarantee in the security of reality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the two witches can get into the crowd as soon as possible, it is a huge protection for Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, Su Ge got up very early. The sky was still bright, and it rose at half past five. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, I put on my clothes quietly and took two haha ​​out to prepare for the morning run. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;朦胧Bern City, the morning mist of the winter enveloped the entire city, plus the dim light, visibility is only about ten meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, this city is not too developed. Although there are a lot of soot, the air quality is still decent."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge said in his heart, with two hahas along the memory to the west to start trot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the Xiangguo Street, Su Ge ran with the second Harbin towards the edge of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one is very quiet on the street today, and Su Ge did not meet the three patrolmen of Rogan and ran straight into the wilderness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the winter continues, the snow in the wilderness is getting thicker and thicker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the caravan has compacted the snow on the road, although it is very slippery, it can still run normally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge runs while controlling his breathing and looking for rhythm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More than a thousand meters of road, Su Ge ran with two haha ​​all the way, only slightly breathing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a huge difference from the last time you came over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Suddenly I feel that my physique has changed from a normal person to a long-distance runner." Su Ge thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The factory today has been completely blocked by heavy snow, but there are still many human footprints. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the wealthy people who are idle and okay come out to hunt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge took the second step and found the ditch in the footsteps. After the ditch had advanced for about a dozen meters, Su Ge once again came to the familiar iron gate. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time the iron gate was full of snow, it seems that the people inside have not come out for two or three days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
