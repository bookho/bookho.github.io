			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mill's slight eyes, looking at the embarrassed Su Ge smiled: "Don't be nervous, I have nothing malicious. Yesterday I heard that you are the Church of the Holy Blood. People, I feel that you should know Jackos."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge indulged and nodded and said: "Master Gerlos is the guide who brought me into the church. I am very grateful to him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sure enough." Mill put his hands behind his back and looked at it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge calmly asks: "Are you derived from the point that I used the potion?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, because in the Berant Empire, only Jerouss can accurately grasp the amount, let the ordinary people live after using the potion."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug recalled that Gerlos made himself and the potion confident and indifferent, and his heart was admired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you think ordinary people are likely to use potions?" Mill asked suddenly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is silent, combined with his own experience: "If there is enough improvement, should it be okay?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mill did not answer, quietly moving forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When speaking, Su Ge has followed Mill to the stairs to the separate area of ​​yesterday's corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is my mysterious workshop, your main place to work in the future." Mill said as he pushed the door open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge indulged, or followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a very pungent drug in the house, with an area of ​​about 100 square meters, with neat display cabinets around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These cabinets are made of glass with a variety of black vials inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These vials are adorned with delicate labels that are neatly arranged and look at at least a few hundred bottles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are four apprentices on the side holding linen, carefully wiping the glass of these showcases. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s calmness followed him without much wait and see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This arrangement is within the expectations of Su Ge, there is no need to see more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mill did not take Su Ge upstairs, standing in the south facing window, just to see the beautiful flower bed statue in front of the castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A younger time can come to the position of the deputy bishop, presumably you are a smart person, know why you came here?" Mil looked faint outside the window ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s face nodded calmly: “Call me in the past is to test the reaction of those ministers to me. If the reaction is too intense, you will come out and take me. Come here to accept your monitoring and deployment, so as to appease people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty has already talked to me about the conditions you have proposed, then I have problems, do this church What is the purpose?" Mir asked not to return. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s calm and calm answer: “For the stability of the northeastern province, there are now many cults who want to use this as a springboard to enter the Berrant Empire. For the sake of security, the Kingdom of Guinness must be secure."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mill continues to ask: "Do you know the grievances of our Guinness Kingdom and the Church?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Slightly know one or two."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you dare to step into our kingdom and mark it Your identity?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Su Ge slowly straightened his waist, looked confident, and said with enthusiasm: "Because I have sincerity, there are Means, there are benefits."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mirs turned his head, a pair of golden cockles staring at Su Ge and said: "Then first show enough sincerity, enough means And enough benefits."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nature is no problem!" Su Ge sighed slightly, and there was an unspeakable style on his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the way, the cautious, cautious Su Ge has grown enough, and now he has the courage and confidence to straighten his waist in front of this hunter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mir body followed, and sharp as the two sharp knives slowly cut on Su Ge, and after a few seconds the mouth slightly raised: "And me." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge followed him up the stairs to the second floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the second floor, Su Ge faintly heard a heartbreaking roar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This squeak has no mysterious elements, but it is very fierce and horrible, listening to Su Ge’s heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this sound is not on the second floor, it seems to be from the top of the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The sound insulation system here doesn't seem to be very good." Sug said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mill sighed: "Maybe he is too loud, the best soundproofing material has been used here. It was previously used as a execution room for capital punishment." Later, I was transformed into a laboratory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s heart beat and his eyes looked around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The space on the second floor is much larger than the first floor. Just came in is a living room of about 60 square meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The north side of the living room is a corridor leading to both sides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, there are quite a few apprentices walking around, holding herbs in their hands, or transporting clean distilled bottles, beakers and other experimental containers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two did not stay on the second floor and went directly to the third floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three floors are already at the top of the building. The layout of the entire three floors is similar to that of the second floor. There is a lobby in the middle, but it is obvious that the wall on the left side of the corridor is It is much thicker than the right side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Master, the experiment begins right away." A woman in her thirties came over and said steadily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is one of my best assistants, called Marvel." Mill said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded: "Hello."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marvel took the lead and looked cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then three people walked to the second door on the left side of the corridor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a metal iron gate that is very tightly closed, just like a space capsule door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The hydraulic pump technology should be used." Suger saw a similar door in the basement of the Macock Clinic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you using the inferior shark potions that have been blended?" asked Mil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug shook his head: "I don't know, when the battle was just over, the master of Gerlos suddenly gave me, it should not be deployed."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mill looked at Sug and put his hand on the door. With the input of the psionic power, a complicated rune appeared on the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;噗嗤! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a second, with a burst of steam, the door actually opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fingerprint lock!?" Su Ge was shocked to see this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This thing is very similar to the fingerprint doors of the researchers in science fiction movies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the door, Su Ge saw the Tes still in a coma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marvel took out a bottle of black medicine bottle and slammed it down to open the mouth of Tes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After taking out your notebook and starting to record. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The 12th trial of the inferior lion potion begins. It is expected that the target will die after fifteen seconds, but the muscle strength will increase by three times." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mill explained: "This is the lion's potion that I have deployed. I try to reduce the toxicity when it is guaranteed. The poison of the shark potion you take is 15 and the lion potion is only 10." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next time the lion's potion was drunk, the comatose Tes suddenly opened his eyes, then his hands covered his neck and suddenly screamed at the incomparable bullying. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge brows slightly wrinkled, and gives himself a quiet rumor, quietly watching, not moving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, it can be seen that the blood vessels of Tes's body have turned into lacquer black, and the pupils are shrinking and can not be seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark blood vessels are raised, the muscles of the limbs are as vigorous and creeping as the living, and the heart beats like a drum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Kill...Qi...kill...I am!" Tes said hard, then the muscles began to swell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the blink of an eye, his body has risen three times and suddenly changed from an ordinary person to a muscular giant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pump! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But ten seconds, the beating drum sounds abruptly stopped, and Tes suddenly spits out a big black blood, and the huge body falls to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marvel calmly recorded: "The heart can't bear the load, the explosion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;噗嗤! Hey! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the raised black blood vessels suddenly burst like a firecracker, and the black blood like ink splattered everywhere in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, this is not finished. When Su Ge thought he was dead, Tes suddenly opened his eyes and once again issued the horrible scream: "kill I am begging you to kill me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When struggling, the crisp broken sound came out, and Su Ge knew that this was his bones could not withstand strong The consequences of the muscles being torn off by the muscles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
