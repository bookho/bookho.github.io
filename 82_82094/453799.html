			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the gloomy Mike, Evan did not answer, turned and prepared to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug can help him now, but he can't help him for a lifetime. Su Ge is not the bishop here, and will one day leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he does not intend to further expand the contradiction now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge turned slightly and glanced at Evan, and he was very satisfied with his heart. Evan was fully mature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When this Evan is silent, Mike naturally does not intend to give up, here is his home, he wants to humiliate the bottom people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he was just stepping forward to get up, a silver cane suddenly appeared, very rude to the belly of his white suit, suddenly A dirty black spot appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are looking for death!" Mike saw the eyes wide open and looked up in anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge lifted his hat slightly, his dark eyes with a high indifference, and did not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the moment of seeing this eye, Mike’s angry face suddenly became pale, and when he reached his throat, he was stuck in the eyes of the blind man, but his mouth was too big to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two steps of the physical instinct, Su Ge gave him a look, did not say a word, turned and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This guy... is this guy still that Suger Sotos?" Mike looked at Su Ge's back, his eyes full of fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not in the same class as Su Ge, but in the same session, but he still saw the farce of the prom, as a funny clown, He has some impressions of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought that even if Su Ge became a bishop, the change should not be great. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But today, this scared him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Young master, what should I do?" asked the brave bodyguard on the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mike is now returning to God, biting his teeth: "To inform Uncle Burke."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the crowd, Evan’s mood is somewhat depressed, and it seems that there is something wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge patted him on the shoulder: "Don't worry, it's okay to give me these things. When you grow up, it's up to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan looked up at Su Ge and nodded slightly: "This can only be done."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Hey! Evan, I haven't seen you for a long time." A familiar voice sounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan turned to look at it, just to see a lady wearing a blue tube top dress with a blond hair and a young man came over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman's skin is fair and slim, and the exposed clavicle is matched with a silver-white necklace. The match is very reasonable and beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey! Judy." Evan sorted out his thoughts, covering up his disgust and smiling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the female student who changed Su Ge’s life track, Judy Palmer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The male partner next to her is not the rich second generation in college. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Judy smiled at Evan: "I’m sorry, I didn’t contact any other students after the contact, so I only came five or six. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan smiled back: "Nothing, you can invite me, I am already very happy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is my fiance, Marlow Mario, the heir to the Mario family." Speaking of this, Judy looked proud and happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan looked at Mr. Marlow, who looked like he was in his thirties, but his face was slightly longer and he was somewhat bald. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to mention ugly, but really does not stand with handsome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Malo looked at Evan, his expression was cold, and his expression was high: "There are a lot of celebrities and big people you can't afford today, don't make anything." Indecent behavior."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan opened his mouth and didn't know how to answer it for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maluo’s face showed a sneer, and the people were the untouchables, and they would not say anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A lot of celebrities come today? Why didn't I see it?" At this moment, Su Ge, who had been looking around for four weeks, asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marlow glanced at Su Ge: "The people in your inferior society are naturally inaccessible to the upper class."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing this, Evan couldn’t help but laugh out loud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you laughing at?" Marlow brows slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is laughing at you ignorance." Su Ge said this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marlow looked at Su Ge and immediately felt that this person’s temperament was extraordinary, not to mention the elegant temperament of the gesture, the tone of this oppressive feeling made him feel very Not comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he feels that he has been suppressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next side of Judy sees suddenly stunned, his eyes wide and slightly, carefully looked, then tempted to ask: "Sug Sotos?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge took off his hat, raised his hand and licked his slightly longer hair, and the dark and slender eyebrows rose slightly, with a hint of accident: "Oh? You Remember me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sug Sotos!?" When he heard the name, Marlow was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This legendary bishop is a household name in Bain City. In the past year, there have been ears about his deeds and rumors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan screamed at the side: "Mr. Mario, the bishop of the Church of the Holy Blood is the words of the inferior in your mouth. I really can't imagine whether you are talking about the upper class or the society."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Marlow’s eyes twitched slightly, his face was slightly red, and he could not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Judy looked at Su Ge’s heart at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The immediate Su Ge has been completely different from Su Ge a year and a half ago. The black hair and pupils with white skin make him more handsome and mysterious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elegant temperament, calm look and look down on the eyes of the upper-level person, let her talk for a long time, the palms slowly squeezed, bowed I dare not go to see Su Ge again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge knows that they are no longer a person of the world, and they don’t want to engage in vulgar counterattacks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Mario, I hope that you respect some of my friends. He is now a mechanical genius nominated by the Steam Association. It is best to pay attention to your words when you speak. Tone and posture."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stop, Su Ge’s eyes with a look of indifference: "Otherwise, when the family suddenly decays, you don't know if you are offended." Who is it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pump! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, Marlow’s long face was even more ugly, but her heart was angry but she did not dare to show it. She only respectfully said: “Yes, thank you for the bishop. Instigation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug did not respond, with Evan turned and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Just really deflated!" Evan clenched his fists and smirked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge has no feeling that his current state of mind does not need to be satisfied in this way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; patted him on the shoulder and whispered in his ear: "I will accidentally run, don't run around, follow me closely, don't leave me two The range of meters."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon hearing this Evan, I nodded and said, "Okay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just after a lap, Su Ge found at least 20 mysterious people present, accounting for A third of the entire banquet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people are keeping a wait-and-see attitude, very low-key, seemingly looking for something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When picking up a glass of wine, Su Ge walked in the crowd and talked and laughed very naturally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey?" Hearing, Su Ge heard a familiar voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turning around, wearing a handsome suit and long skirt, Moore and Serena stood on the side of the path and looked at themselves unexpectedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know that I am handsome, but there is no need to look at me like this." Su Ge raised his chin slightly and said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is absolutely embarrassing to say such things before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But today is not the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moore looked at Su Ge carefully and walked over and sighed: "Don't say, it's really handsome."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serena also feels that Su Ge has obvious changes, more self-confidence, more firm, more... evil? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selina is a bit sloppy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You got the news too?" Moore came over and whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge shook his head slightly: "I came to the class meeting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only And?" Serena did not believe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge laughed: "It’s natural to stop and watch."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it right?" Moore drank a drink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge shook his head: "The Lord should have not appeared."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the other people in the church also here? If it really fights, someone needs to maintain order." Serena asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no need to maintain order."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you mean?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Just grab him before everyone." Su Ge turned his cane and replied at random. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selina is somewhat dissatisfied: "It’s easy to say, the guy is an expert thief, how do you catch him?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looks at the dark night sky: "Find him, kill him, get something, the event subsides."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are Insult me?" Serena clenched her fists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge did not respond, patted Moore: "The training is still not in place."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp After that, I left with Evan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selina grinds her teeth: "This guy is more arrogant than a few days ago."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Moore touched his chin and pondered the words of Su Ge: "Actually, what he said is quite reasonable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are also stupid !!" Serena's eyes sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mur's smile, not to say a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very purposeful object for Su Ge with Evan going straight out of the manor’s hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge turned slightly and smiled: "I am "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Identified Su Ge, is a sexy woman wearing a red dress. It is Julie of the Twins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
