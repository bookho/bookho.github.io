			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert looked at Su Ge’s calm face, and there was an indescribable shock inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even, his 30-year mysterious career, the understanding of certain things has been completely refreshed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sug Sotos, isn’t their church in the late night really the dawn of the entire desperate world?” Albert thought of it now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hall, people still don’t know what happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They just feel just a little embarrassed, it seems to have made a terrible nightmare, in the dream there are countless beasts chasing themselves, and finally they suddenly got huge When the power was ready to kill all the monsters, they suddenly woke up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke hidden in the crowd is very clever, hidden behind the crowd to the edge of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, he has deeply believed in the promise that Suge made to him before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Markey 回 returned from the sluggish species, gloomy out of the crowd, hands slowly on the chest, staring at Su The grid does not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug does not attack with a long sword, and seems to be waiting for something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The side of Albert can't restrain his curiosity that is about to explode, and asks: "How did you just do it?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge casually said: "Is it a rare slogan of the sacred official?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert listens At this point, I almost screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This tm is a meditation? If this is a meditation, then all the priests in the church should die!" Albert screamed violently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, these words did not dare to speak out directly, and some embarrassed said: "The meditation can achieve this effect? ​​It is incredible."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge is a confused master, laughing and saying: "You are not the priest of the church, do not know the true power of meditation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert is not talking, He knew that he couldn't ask anything useful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malkey’s voice hoarsely said: "I don't know what method you used, and I don't know who you are praying for. You are sure to go far It was my expectation and caused great trouble to my plan."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded casually: "And then?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marchy's demeanor: "Now, I want to come up with my real card and come up with my strongest means. I want to kill you all!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she finished, her hands on her chest seemed to be crushing something, and then, like magic, she took out a bone knife and pierced it directly. Your own chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a flesh and blood sacrifice!" Seeing this, Ieta, who was hiding, could no longer calm down, and suddenly stood up and lost his voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge turned his head and saw that Yeta was terrified at this moment, as if he had seen the most horrible sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert's body rushed up instantly: "Block her!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's late!" At this time, Marchi's whole body was blood, a vicious smile, and an indescribable ray of light appeared instantly, completely covering the entire ship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, her own body turned into a disgusting pus and disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's over! It's over! This is completely over." Iyer, who has always been mature and calm, is sitting on the ground like a child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The side of Pigu saw such a disappointment in Ms. Iyeta’s heart: "A woman is a woman after all, what is the use of knowing more? It’s a big deal, there’s nothing at all, it’s not a big deal.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the first time in many years, Pigu felt that his male temperament and charm were revealed. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge did not move, looking at the calm and said: "I admire your determination, your determination and courage remind me of an enemy I used to."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Flesh and blood sacrifice, not all sacrifices made of flesh and blood as sacrifices are called flesh and blood sacrifices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called flesh and blood sacrifice is the most horrible sacrifice method in the entire sacrifice system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because this sacrifice has only one effect, it is to summon the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sacrifice has several very critical points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First: The sacrificer must hold items related to the summoning of the gods, that is, relics that have been in contact with the gods or have been influenced by divine power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relics of this god are originally very rare, and all discovered are hidden, or enshrined, as a treasure of the town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second: The sacrificial ceremonies must have been linked and communicated with the gods, that is, they have a certain understanding and contact with the divine power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third: All the ceremonies of the ceremonies will be swallowed up by the gods because of the wrath of the gods, and they themselves are sacrifices for this sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first two of them are just more demanding, but this third is a choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All those who hold the ceremony want to gain knowledge and benefits from the ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important thing about these knowledge and benefits is that you must be alive to be useful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this sacrifice ceremony belongs to the same kind of method. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sacrificing others is easy, sacrificing yourself, it is very difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ritual summons the power of the real gods, the power that smashes the existence of all the existence of the world, and even the rules of the world, and human beings cannot resist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
