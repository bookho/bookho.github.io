			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a sumptuous dinner, two people sat on the sofa in front of the fireplace and chatted with hot black tea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After becoming a formal nun, I am qualified to live in a monastery. And after becoming an official nun, things and rituals need to be done a lot more. So I will live in the monastery often, and I will come back one week," Ada said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug is not surprised, he knows something about the nuns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is that work very busy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ada smiled: "For I am all the same. As long as I can make others feel good, revealing a heartfelt smile, I can do more work. Because for me, seeing their sincere smile is my greatest happiness. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge heard a little envy after listening to his face, just as he envied the classmates who liked to learn when he was a child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because no matter how hard and boring things are, just enjoy it and you can have a lot of fun and achieve great achievements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, what do the tramps do?" Su Ge thought and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Ada said with a heavy face: "The police said that the tramp is dead, and the body has been cremation and burial because it is too scary. We They can only pray for them in the church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge listened and sighed: "I certainly can’t let you see, that weird thing, let you Ordinary people see that the estimated vision will skyrocket."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afterwards, two people chatted about the experience of the day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ada knows that Su Ge has an independent studio and smiles proudly: "If other nuns know that my younger brother is already in the Church of the Holy Blood." If you are a clergyman, you will be very envious of me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this Su Ge is also a little proud, outstanding and superior, everyone likes this sense of accomplishment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Exactly, I guess I will rarely come back in the future. I will study intensively for some time in the future, so I may often live in the church. Let's choose a time, then have a meal together and chat." Ada Without coming back, Su Ge had plenty of reasons to live in his "little house." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ida accepted it with pleasure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two people chatted for a while and then went back to sleep in the bedroom every Saturday. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is not much movement in the dream of sitting on the battleship. I have all the lines related to the map of the Church of the Holy Blood and the landmark buildings. After living, I went to sleep completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, Su Ge got up early, put his daily necessities in a box, and after saying goodbye to Ada, who was also packing things, Erha went to the Church of the Holy Blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the route of the chest, Su Ge came to his own mysterious workshop, opened the door and saw that the inside had been cleaned up, the curtain They were all withdrawn, and two sets of new tables and chairs were placed intimately around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Follow the stairs to the living room on the second floor, not only the windows are covered with dark red curtains, but also the large bedding is laid out on the large and soft beds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Putting things down and watching this bedroom with a size of 40 meters square meters, Su Ge mouth mad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a good place, it will belong to me in the future!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simplify the daily necessities Let go, Su Ge rushed to the library with his second husband. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He now, wants to expand his knowledge, has been crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I came to the library in the morning, there are not many people here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are the new Ziyue traveler Su Ge Sotos?" Just walked in, a little old voice came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug turned to see an old priest wearing a black robe and a wheelchair, looking at himself with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man looked seven or eighty, with a black hat, white hair and a wrinkled face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has only one leg, and the other leg has shrunk and cannot support his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge respectfully said, "Yes, respected priest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old one Face kindly: "My name is Mason Water, just call me Father Father Water. I am the administrator of this library. If you want to borrow a book, you need to come to me to register."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg listened and nodded: "Okay, thank you, Father Water."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The entire library The catalogue of books is engraved on the pillars, and there are also book-like engravings over there. If there is anything you can't find, come over and ask me.” Father Water said enthusiastically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug said with a smile: "Good, passionate Father Water, the goddess is with you."<br /><br />&nbsp; Father Waterer returned to the ceremony and then looked at Erha and said, "This is really a good dog. Marx must be very happy after seeing it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, turn away in a wheelchair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug did not waste any time, turned to the column and looked at the catalogue above. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I lack a lot of common sense things, including mystery, science, the basics of related religions, etc."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking in my heart, Su Ge first found a religious class, the coordinates are W12H2. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After recording the coordinates, Su Ge found the mysterious class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the mystery includes too much, Su Ge has found four categories in the following sections: Intelligence, Monster, Faction, and Materials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coordinates are W3H1,3,5,6,9. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that, Su Ge found a category related to steam science with coordinates W5H3. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After determining the coordinates, Su Ge began his book-seeking journey on the stairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Religious class he found two thick books. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A book introducing all the books of today's large and medium-sized religions, entitled "Large and Medium Religious Encyclopedias"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The second is to introduce the history and development of the three major churches and some cults with long-term inheritance, called "Dispute across the Years." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take these two books away, and Su Ge came to the mysterious class, and Ken quickly found the books he needed in the similar categories. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A total of four books, introducing the common sense of the mysterious world and the traditional "mystery history". Introducing the mysterious monster's "Legend Monster". Introduce the introduction to the introduction of the mysterious law matrix. Finally, the "last drop of dragon blood" that introduces mysterious materials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The six heavy books are already one meter high and thirty pounds heavy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Su Ge did not stop, went to the steam science category, found the "gear art" that introduced the history of steam technology, and included some recent "Outstanding Inventions" constructed by all the principles of invention technology in the past years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Su Ge carried the eight books and went down, Father Waterer stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You all borrowed?" He picked up the reading glasses and took a closer look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled and said: "My basic knowledge is relatively weak, so I have to learn from the basics."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;French Waterman agreed very smoothly and agreed not to say anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A younger person can become a purple moon substitute, and his ability has not been able to say anything more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these eight books with thousands of pages, Su Gemei returned to his mysterious workshop, and when everything was ready, Suge sat down. First, open the mysterious history and take a deep breath and say: "Well, Su Ge beast is now evolving and digesting these books, hoping to turn me into a learned Su Ge beast, and later evolve into a bullish Su Ge beast. !"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
