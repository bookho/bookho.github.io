Su Ge asked after reaching a consensus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He does not believe that Albert is purposeful to find himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert sighed: "I came here to find a candidate. I just came back from the lion city of the empire, and lived here for a day." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Looking for a candidate? To cure the church dignitaries?" Su Ge asked unexpectedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alber features nod: "The four colleges help the church to stabilize the mysterious world and provide them with some excellent talents. Now they have troubles and naturally ask for help." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the result?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a serious internal struggle, no one cares about me." At this point, Albert’s old face was a little wronged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is too real. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about the Nighthawk and the Holy Blood Church?" Su Ge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert said: "There are two other messengers that have passed, but we talked to each other last night and they all hit the wall."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The purpose of these two churches is obvious, intervening in the management system of the college, hoping to see the information of the relevant cult members."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Su Ge certainly won't say this stupidity directly to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the one hand, not all so-called cults want to do something big. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, as a neutral organization between the mysterious world and the church, we must ensure an absolute neutral attitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once this is opened, the credibility of the four colleges will be gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Albert was very happy and relaxed. "The Master of Weiss is very happy. I met you when I came back. You may not know, I saw you in the darkness, I almost cried."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It can be seen that your tears have already turned around in your eyes." Shelly suddenly inserted a knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"............"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At one time, the scene was very embarrassing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After talking about this, the general situation has been understood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three then left the deck and entered the cabin along the corridor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interior of the cabin is very luxurious, with the golden glow of the top of the ceiling shining through the dark yellow walls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire main hall is divided into three floors, with a duplex structure, the three stairs in front are linked together and extend to the inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time there are already a lot of passengers in the hall to put their luggage, talking in twos and threes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This seven-day journey is the best time for these elites to expand their network and hook up their lover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three people walked in and did not attract anyone’s attention, passing through the crowd and preparing to go to the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole hall is large, but the night clock of Su Ge is bigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Invisible night clocks spread out with minimal psionic power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, in the sphere of the radius of 100 meters centered on Su Ge, everyone, the hull structure is instantly transmitted to Su Ge’s mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嘶嘶...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge took a breath on his forehead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong?" asked Albert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge shook his head: "It's okay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl, standing on the side, looked at Sug, and the three black hairs turned white at a speed visible to the naked eye. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is very clear that Su Ge’s human head is somewhat overloaded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the advancement of psionics and knowledge, the range and accuracy of the night clock have been greatly improved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consequence of this increase is that it will collect terror messages at this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These messages were sent back in the mind of Su Ge through the psionic vibrations in a second, and the huge load often caused a headache. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the hall, along the corridor on the third floor, about 50 meters, two people took the card from the hands of the attendant and walked into the bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because on the boat, the size of the bedroom is not large, about 40 square meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bedroom is beautifully decorated, separated by a translucent glass between the bedroom and the washroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foot on the soft carpet, Su Ge nodded with satisfaction, holding his forehead on the leather sofa facing the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley sat lightly beside the bed, facing Sug Road: "You continue this way, the body will have problems sooner or later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know, it’s been the habit of using the night clock for the past two years." Sug said, leaning against the chair and sighing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley gave his own advice: "Don’t rely too much on this for some time to come."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge indulged, then accidentally looked at Shirley: "I didn't expect you to start thinking about the world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snow Lill screamed: "Do you need to think about this thing? You know all the toes. If you want to be free to move on the mainland, you must abandon your previous identity, then the night bell of the Soge Sotos sign is natural. Can't continue to use it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge nodded: "Mysterious people are always pulling the eggs of the church in March, but no one dares to beat the face of the church in March."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If For a while, Su Ge was still using the night clock, which means he will play the face of the church in March. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, I have other means now." Su Ge's current knowledge is relatively broad, not the power of relying too much on the night clock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the future, you will reach a lot of people, you have to give yourself a perfect identity. Your knowledge, your profession, even yours Look and so on." Sherry continued. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg heard these moments and fell into meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When two people talked, Su Ge suddenly frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you still having a headache?" Sherry said, throwing a can of espresso that Sug often drank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug shook his head and looked slightly at the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheryl knows what he means, not to say more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge adjusted the aftermath of the night clock to keep it within 20 meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the door, he saw a man about one meter seven drawing something on his door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's wind and iron." Su Ge recognized that he had drawn two Keynes runes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, the person has drawn almost the same, accompanied by a very subtle psionic wave, the two runes form a simple array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s mouth tilted slightly, and the heart said: “Albert is right, there are so many ghosts in the four colleges. It’s estimated that they are asking for help.” The process has long been stared at."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the person finished painting, he hurried away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge opened the coffee and took a sip, and got up and walked toward the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it so broken? In your habit, not all of them are weak, pretend that nothing has been found, waiting for the opposite?" Lil asked unexpectedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is talking about the method that Suge used when he was monitoring Laurie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge put his hand on the door handle and said confidently: "At that time it was because I was too weak."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not strong now." Shirley likes to lift the bar with Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge has long been used to: "Strong is not strong, no matter how strong ants are ants for humans, but at the level of ants, it It’s already strong enough, that’s enough. After all, it’s mainly dealing with ants in this life, not humans.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Your reason is endless.” Snow Lil looked unhappy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This conversation with Su Ge, she has never won. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug has opened the door and looked at nothing outside: "Using chameleon ink, the middle is doped with some sheep blood, the main The role is to monitor and eavesdrop."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He’s mouth slightly tilted and said: “Children, you don’t know that you are better than your own existence, leaving your own Is the law and psionic link a very dangerous thing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said, he raised his finger and burned a tiny cold flame between his fingers. A circle was drawn around the two runes, and then a rune was repainted on the rune with the cold flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a Keynes rune symbolizing sulphur. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the core foundation of occultism and alchemy, sulphur represents energy and the sun, also known as the perfect red king, similar in nature to Chinese yin and yang Yang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The role of this rune in all Keynes runes is co-ordinated and driven, generally as the most important cornerstone of the entire array and the culmination of the closing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the perfect red king also has the meaning of lighting and searching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Based on sulphur, the three spires are the culmination of perfection, which is controlled by this to burn."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the spell's reading, the triangle's runes suddenly flashed a burst of brilliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, numerous invisible lines of the naked eye appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These threads link to the runes on the wall, and the other side links to a certain place on the ship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The place is the owner of this rune. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s mouth reveals a vicious smile: “If you want to be an uninvited guest, you have to pay some price.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, his hands clasped together, and a burst of black mist appeared from his palm, giving off a burst of mood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the knowledge of death he has. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These black gas gradually changed into a mini pistol in his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This mini rifle pierced the basic array like a nail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the invisible silk was instantly blackened, and the next moment was passed to the other side of the thread. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good luck." Su Ge waved his hand at the silk and walked into the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the innermost room on the third floor, the young man just sat down and prepared to eavesdrop on the voices of the two mysterious people through meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He belongs to the Brotherhood of the Yellow Emperor, this time the task is to track the dean of the college to determine what help he found. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After I was on board, I was sure that Su Ge was the helper I was looking for in the college. He quietly tapped the squad with his own covert hand, in less than a minute. The time was imprinted on the doors of the two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a little proud to sit on the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because even in expert detectives, there are not a few speeds that can be drawn beyond him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important thing is that his drawing speed has exceeded his original record. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reduce from 63 seconds to 53 seconds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this speed, plus the secretive means that he is proud of, he believes he can get himself from those who don’t look strong. The information needed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he was just ready to eavesdrop, his inspiration was like a power-up, letting him burst into his body, and his body faintly trembled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be discovered!? This is impossible!" Young people are very confident in their means. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has repeatedly tracked the master mystery, and has not revealed any horses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he thought about it, he felt a sharp pain in his palm, as if he had been pierced by a needle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嘶嘶! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sucked a cold air and suddenly bowed his head and found that he had just drawn the right hand of the circle and didn’t know why it had turned black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under his intimidating gaze, the skin on his right hand began to swollen rapidly, festering, and purulent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the horror and pain together, there is a stench of sour smell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is... what a ghost thing!" The young man hugged his arm and lay on the ground, screaming and groaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, things are not over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the palm of his hand completely festered, he felt a chill in his back, as if something horrible was watching himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he was lying on the ground at this time, he knew that there was nothing but a soft carpet behind him.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that’s the way, the horrible gaze made him The scalp is numb, the heart can't help but accelerate, and the fierce fear makes him unable to control his head and look around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Slowly turning back, he saw a few green eyes, staring at himself with a non-human eye, and the masters of these eyes Not a monster, but a dark substance like a mud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What a horrible thing!!?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪嗒! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lingsight has risen by 5 points! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he was frightened, the horrible thing had stretched out two tentacles to grab his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the crucial moment, he reflects his qualities and means as an expert mystery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He almost instantly tore his clothes, revealing his naked upper body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his chest, there is a huge shadow, the shadow is composed of sand, and the blur can be seen as a huge existence, draped in a sand The composition of the robe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment when the tattoo appeared, the young man took out the high-level mysterious materials such as Deer King, Ghost Grass and other grasses from the waist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whistling...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A breeze blew through and can see his muscles begin Severe squirming, and then the materials of the deer horns, ghost grass and other materials in the palm gradually disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the phantom of his chest is like alive, gently squirming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哗! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just wriggle, the phantom of the black mud disappears completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
