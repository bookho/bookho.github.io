			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Soviets who left the wooden chapel did not take a few steps and met outside Anthony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge looked at them with a smile: "Are you praising me with me? How do you feel that the Archbishop has high expectations for me."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are just telling the truth." Ms. Marlene smiled and spread her hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Father Anthony patted Suger’s shoulder and said: “This is a good opportunity. If you can get this thing done perfectly, then becoming a bishop is a sure thing. The opportunity and the risk are directly proportional. And this time the task is not as dangerous as it seems."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded, and the group walked side by side In the rescue area, Ivan’s eyes sparkled: “There are still three days to go, I will apply for some materials to the Archbishop and make a few more used equipment for you!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Su Ge heard this eye lit up and hugged Ivan and smiled: "It’s my good brother! Just do it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Whenever there is any need for help, let us call us, the group of sturdy sacred swords will look down on us, and then Su Ge will become a bishop, and they will dare to look down on us!" Father Harden said with an angry look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After mentioning this matter, Su Ge’s eyes flashed a glimmer of cold, and his head glanced back and said calmly: “Reliably, I am very good at dealing with these self-righteous guys. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the separation of the people, continue their work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, Bain City is not a waste of time, but it also requires a lot of work to deal with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge had to prepare for the next task, and did not follow the murder of Ms. Marlene, but first followed Ivan to his temporary workshop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These days require a lot of civil work and measurement work to be dealt with. Ivan, who has many inventions, has become the focus of everyone, and he built it for the first time. A temporary mysterious workshop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this workshop, Ivan has produced four robots that can automatically move bricks, and the level and length measuring instruments that form light by current. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These things have greatly helped the church staff who are recalculating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, all this can't be done by himself, and now he has two assistants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One is Roland, an Evan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland, who has just become a clergyman, has no fighting power and lacks a lot of mystery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Rogan assigned her here as an apprentice to Ivan. When I was studying, I was also mixed with Ivan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Su Ge’s good buddy Evan was here at Su Ge’s recommendation as an official assistant to Ivan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a high-level student in mechanical engineering, Evan has received the attention of the church through the last improved steam engine, and this time Ivan needs a lot of mechanical design and At the time of manufacture, it was recommended by Su Ge, and it came to work here smoothly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, Evan does not intend to join the Church of the Holy Blood. His goal is the Steam Guild, a high-level guild that only mechanical engineering experts can join, and the whole world. 60% of the patented inventions on steam machinery are the only organizations on the mainland that ignore borders and ignore religion and can eat in any country or region. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the two came back, Su Ge was seeing Roland holding a charcoal pencil and carefully drawing a circle of circles on the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Avon sat on the chair, wearing a head-mounted magnifying glass, and observed a precision machine that was only the size of a human thumb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people are very serious, Su Ge did not bother them, followed Ivan to the second floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second floor is a place dedicated to mysterious experiments and inventions. Because it is built on a temporary basis, there is no partition. It looks like a factory building of about two hundred square meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A variety of instruments and materials have been placed in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You didn't destroy the moon?" After I came up, Ivan whispered a mysterious look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly, untied the robe, revealing his left revolver. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gun is now Su Ge’s most threatening killer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's good, that's good. This time the gun can protect you very well. I was going to make some bullets for you. But three days is not enough, let's start from other aspects!" Ivan said, taking Sug to the front of the counter on the left side of the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The main weapon is now unconditional, I will help you with some auxiliary things." Ivan said to take out a tape measure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this?" Su Ge looked at Ivan carefully measuring the thickness of his wrist, the length of his arms, his wingspan, his back width, etc. It is a fine tailor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivan smiled: "This is something I designed very early on, I have been prepared to make it but there is no time."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I call it the ultimate assisted assassination system."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey? Have you been infected by Vegginia?" Su Ge heard the name suddenly a sore liver. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivan’s face was reddish, and some embarrassed said: “This is a temporary name, I haven’t thought about the official name yet.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug knows his character, smiles and opens the topic and asks: "Let’s talk about the effect!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "You wait." Ivan said as he ran to the side of the cupboard and rummaged, then took out a large piece of paper that looked like some time, full of dust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, there are backups in the library, otherwise I have completely retired so many inventions before." Ivan looked awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second day after the Church of the Holy Blood was leveled, Ivan, who had recovered from the unsettled sorrow, discovered that his mysterious workshop and all the previous inventions disappeared, and suddenly his eyes were red, squinting to hide in a corner of no one. Crying silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Suge found him, the two big eyes crying were not swollen, as if they were red-eye mice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge spent a long time to get him ok, these days have passed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blowing the dust off, Ivan spread the drawing and said, "Look, this thing is like a close-fitting dress, can be stored behind the back Some small tools and weapons can eject the daggers in the two cuffs, and can also eject small claws. The lines of the claws are made of thin steel wire. The effective ejection distance is 20 meters and can withstand the weight of 300 kilograms. There are some bullets, pharmacy, and materials in the waist. The two underarms can be placed on the side of the moon, and the side can store the auxiliary weapon to prevent accidents."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have a layer of leather made of black wool and iron fibers on the back of my chest and on the outside of my arms. Not only can I effectively block mysterious penetration, but I can also defend against swords and bullets." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge was surprised after reading it, and then the finger neckline said: "You add a hood here, I not only open the unparalleled assassination mode, but also believe Leap."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;"What do you mean?" Ivan listened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg coughed: "Nothing, this dress is very similar to the one I know."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Aigio Auditore."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "I don't know." Ivan scratched his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger didn’t say much if he tweeted at random, and asked: “Can such a precise thing be made in three days?”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Only from mechanical physics, of course, but we still have mystery!" Ivan said, playfully blinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
