			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge did not speak after listening, thinking about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Betty carefully tested the question: "Can you ask the priest of the church to cover my brother for help? Recently we have wanted to take him to check it. As a result, he did not agree with life and death, and we have no way. He is now very weak in spirit. If forced by rash, parents are afraid that his spirit will collapse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the young man in front of her is a small playmate, she is now a bishop and governs a church and believer in a country. In her identity and status, she has no longer a level with herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge looked up and smiled: "Don’t be too cautious, call me Su Ge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Said that he stood up and walked straight to Evan's bedroom door and said, "Don't worry, Betty. Just give it to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;End, reach out and knock Knocked on the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no sound inside the knockdown, so Su Ge increased his strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annoying knocking on the door sounded more than a dozen times, there was a irritating voice inside: "I said Betty! I don't eat lunch!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug did not speak and continued to knock on the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very clear about Evan’s character. If he now says that he is Su Ge, combined with the current situation of two people, Evan will not only see long-lost The friend’s sense of happiness, but there will be a feeling of inferiority. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So his current goal is clear, let him open the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After about a minute of continuous knocking, Suger heard a roar from inside, followed by a messy footstep, and then the door was suddenly opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a bit of sour stench and smell of alcohol, Evan, with a big beard and a sullen face, appeared in front of Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is wearing a dirty pajamas, his cheeks are thin and pale, his eyes are muddy and violent, like a madman who wanders on the streets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Evan's murky eyes saw the sleek and neat Su Ge, he immediately flashed an indescribable panic and turned and hurriedly closed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge stretched out his cane and took the card to the Lord. He said seriously: "I just learned about it with Betty. I think we should talk about it." , brother."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brother said that Evan’s body trembled and said in a vague voice: “I am no longer qualified as your brother, I am Kinds of rubbish will only drag your hind legs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of giving up closing, turned and fell to the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Betty once said: "Brother, Su Ge can help you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I No need for help, those things that belong to me, I will definitely get it back!" Evan whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s cane fiddled with the beer bottle on the ground and said, “Can this thing get you back?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, he went to the desk again and saw a lot of deceptive books about mystery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is "Thirty Days of Getting Started Mystery", "The Four Keys of Cursing Others", "Astrology Mastering Your Destiny in Twenty Days", "The Human Body The ability to dig.........<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this the way you get your things back?" Su Ge continued to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Betty is a little worried and wants to stop Suge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge made a look at her, and Betty silently left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current situation can only rely on Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After flipping through the books, Su Ge opened his mind and looked at the current Evan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The psionic energy is much weaker than the normal warning line. There is a mental paralysis, the possibility of illusion. The body has a faint mystical atmosphere, it really is because of Something has been contaminated with some mysterious things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone has psionic power, and ordinary people also have it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a more general sense, psionic power is the fire of human soul, that is, the spirit of the spirit. This kind of thing can be high or low because of emotional fluctuations and mental state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Low energy is too low to represent the soul and spirits, and it is prone to mental paralysis, hallucinations, confusion, delusions and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if the psionic energy is too high, it will be easy to reach something that should not be touched,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now Evans can be very low and has already passed the normal warning line. This situation is not just a matter of emotional and mental state, but something that has taken away his psionic power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the current situation, the psionic energy that is sucked away is transformed into mystery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Evan on the bed, a dark red bloody smear under the sleeves of his left arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bloody area seems to be very large, with only a small piece on the wrist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug went over and grabbed his arm and picked up his sleeve, and suddenly saw this piece of huge blood that was 30 centimeters long and four centimeters wide.痂 covers his entire arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Blood Mantra!?" Su Ge brows and asks Evan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time Evan was a little confused and violent, and suddenly opened the Su Ge loud voice: "Don't you manage, roll!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, carefully guard your left arm in your arms, as if you were protecting your child's mother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s finger, a moment of the night of the soul, passed down, and finally calmed Evan’s restless heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The violent attitude gradually subsided, and the turbid eyes also had some clarity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Quiet it?" Su Ge wanted to find a place to sit down, only to find that it was messy and could only stand and ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan groaned and nodded slightly and asked, "What is this ability?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is a sacred rumor of the priest." Su Ge said casually. At the door of the bedroom: "Go and wash yourself, then talk about it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Avon nodded and stood up and said seriously: "Thank you, Su Ge." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Betty at the door saw this look full of surprises. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Evan went to take a shower, she curiously asked: "Suge, are you also mysterious?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before they only knew that Su Ge was a clergyman who was responsible for patrolling and solving crimes. He did not know that he was a mystery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, the information of the church is not open to the public. Who is the ordinary person and who is the mysterious person have no right to know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled and nodded slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is the situation with my brother?" Betty hurriedly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge indulged and said: "He should have inadvertently touched some low-level surgery, which really caused some mysterious phenomena. But it is not serious yet. After a few days of rest, it would be fine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before hearing this, Betty was deeply relieved and patted his chest and said: "Thank you, thank you, Su Ge "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half an hour, after washing, Evan, who shaved his beard, appeared in front of the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this Bettyton happily hugged him: "Thank God, you are finally back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Avon has a slight apology on his face: "Sorry, you and your parents are worried."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two brothers and sisters warmed for a while, Su Ge said: "Betty, you should avoid it first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Betty knows the mysterious surprise and horror, and nodded and turned away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, come over and let me see this curse!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan nodded and walked over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A closer look can see that this bloody blood is like a living thing, seems to be slowly creeping and breathing, like a huge worm lying on his arm, It is disgusting and scary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the lowest level of blood cursing, using the other's blood as a primer, and the aphids cultivated through their own blood. "Effects of being human."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan’s face is somewhat proud to say: "You know me, I won't do something that doesn't make sense."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But do you know the price?" Su Ge raised his head and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan screamed: "What can this cost? At most, you will lose some blood."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Suge sighed and said: "I don't want to pull you into this world, so I won't tell you too much. So, all mysterious curses and sacrifices are not equivalent. It's often that you pay a lot more than you get."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This blood curse, which has only a trace of each other's blood, left The next 99.9% is your own blood. If you really want to use this to curse him, at most, let him catch a cold once, and you will end up with dozens or even hundreds of times more bad luck than him! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing this, Evan's face suddenly paled: "This...this..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "And you don't have enough psionic power, but if you want to spur this curse, you can only burn your own soul. If this thing really starts. The result is that your soul will be because of 诅Burning to death, and acting on your curse because of your death, through the blood of the infection, to your parents and Betty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear this, Evanton was stupid: "This...this is not the same as what he told me. He told me that this thing only needs a small price, just like a mischief."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge said faintly: "In two cases, one who tells you this method is a semi-intelligible half-hanger. The other is that he has ulterior motives."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Evan can't help but tremble, then tempted and asked: "You won't be wrong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your brother, me, Can sit on the position of the bishop, I do not know by blowing bragging." Su Ge responded confidently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Emilia’s coaching, more than half a year of continuous learning, and mysterious authority at the bishop level, Su Ge’s knowledge of mystery is already comparable. Many masters exist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not overkill to say that Su Ge has evolved into a sturdy Su Ge beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What should I do? There is no way to stop this thing before it matures." Evan was in a hurry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge patted his shoulder: "Don’t worry, there is me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon hearing this, Evan gradually relaxed and took a deep breath. He said firmly: "What do you say? If I can prevent my family from being implicated, I will be willing to cut this arm!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge puts his hand on his hand: "Don't look at mystery in a physical way. This kind of thing can't lift the curse if you smash the entire arm." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that he stood up and said: "Go back to the church with me, it is not convenient."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Is it too troublesome?" Evan looked worried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge set his hand: "It’s not a hassle, just need some props and venues, wear clothes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan listened to a sigh of relief, then went back to the bedroom to get dressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge and Betty made a greeting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Betty also said with a sigh of relief: "Okay, I will tell my parents."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;</div>
