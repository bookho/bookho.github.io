			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes continued to patrol, and Su Ge put his attention on the girl's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The physical condition of the two girls is not good. The long-term malnutrition causes them to lose weight and the bones are not very smooth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And for some reason, there are still some dark injuries in the body of two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two people’s bodies shivered at this time, not because of fear, but because of the cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge put away that kind of perspective, and found that both hands and feet have been frostbitten, and the thin clothes worn by the body are constantly being attacked by the cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the two dangerous and extremely evil witches reported in the newspaper!" Su Ge has seen through the essence of the two girls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simple thoughts, Su Ge asked: "Speak your dilemma, my people."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, the two shivering girls showed an indescribable ecstasy, and hurriedly squatted on the floor and said, "Thank you for your kindness, I will wait for you to give us our lives, the inferior people, we The soul, everything we have!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, the blue-haired woman whispered: "We have been wanted by the three churches and are dead at any time. Dangerous. We... We are now hungry and staggered, and we are going to live. The humble servant does not ask my Lord to let us live a good life, just to lower your kindness and let us live."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purple-haired girl hurriedly said, "Please don't feel that we are greedy. The great Lord, as long as we can live, we will offer us everything and spread your Glorious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at these two poor witches, listening to this cheap to Requirements points, Scottish hearts suddenly filled with compassion, but he can not lose the majesty of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he thought for a moment and said: "I feel your piety, very good, believers. Your wishes are not excessive,"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard that the two witches were happy and could not be attached. The body was full of fanaticism: "Thank you for your grace and kindness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Report your location My apostles are looking for you." Su Ge is very imaginary about becoming a god and wants to end the conversation as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue-haired woman immediately said, "We are in the basement of an abandoned school on the west side of the Bayan Empire City of Bain."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge faintly said: "443 Maple Street."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing these two women’s hearts The enthusiasm, hurriedly nodded: "Long live the omniscient my master!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Quiet waiting." After that, the huge body turned into a fog, disappeared not see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the fog disappeared for ten minutes, the two men dared to raise their heads cautiously, and then the two pairs of frozen red hands were held together, and they burst into tears...<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ice Warship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug, wearing a handsome armor of the Lich King, sat on the throne, and was immersed in a pistol in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The witches are poor, but they are all wanted criminals after all. If they are rushed to cover it, they will be discovered by the church, that is a felony."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On the other hand, the family's economic situation is not good. I don't have income, the three-person dog is already very difficult, and the two mouths are afraid that it can't afford it. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But...I really can't bear it!" Su Ge thought of this, pinching the spear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He now knows that the so-called witch is not a descendant of the devil, just being parasitized by mysterious creatures, inexplicably acquired the poor worm of super power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The parasites are now very stable, and the church says that it is out of control, and in all likelihood, it is due to certain stimuli and explosions that occur when threatened by life and death. If they are given a safe and comfortable living environment and a systematic exercise method, they have no problem in controlling this power."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Su Ge suddenly heated up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The witch is a huge force, the world does not know their value. If I take them in, I can not only get a group of absolutely loyal servants, but also Can master tremendous power. This is simply a pie falling from the sky!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The world is not safe, but it is very dangerous. The power of one person is ultimately limited. But if it is a group of people, an organization? It will be very safe!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, the eyes burned two blue wildfires. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This group of witches, I have settled." Su Ge instantly firmed in his heart. After deciding, Su Ge continued to think: "Then, I need at least some income and self-protection ability. Since I am so powerful now, then I Just study your own strength and see if you can't get some means of self-protection."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am now known as the Lord of Death and Storm, from the present form As far as the attributes are concerned, I should be able to master the forces related to death, cold, and storm. If this is the case, I only need to dig out a little bit of something from here, which is enough for me to protect myself."<br />< br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "? so then, how to excavate it," Scotland looked at his body, lost in thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! Boom! Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bell rang three times, and Su Ge looked back from the meditation and looked up, just seeing three transparent souls disappearing into the fog through the big clock. ,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Soul!?" Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Randomly he jumped up and came to the edge of the big clock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, just a distant fly flew over a soul and passed through the big clock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bell rings again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turned out that I said that no one knocked on this clock. The original hit the clock is the soul. I didn't see it because of the lack of vision. Now I have the vision of the gods, everything is clear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looked at the soul through the big clock and listened to the distant sounds of the big clock, gradually entering the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the daytime, he discovered that this sound is not the sound produced by ordinary vibration, but the sound directly acting on the soul through the vibration of the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The vibration of the soul...the guidance and vibration of the psionic power, the sound of the ghost impact, the vibration and interference of the sound diffusion, the material of the soul, the shape of the soul... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, Soge’s head is like a supercomputer that is running at full capacity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The countless unrelated things and knowledge made him think of it together, forming an unprecedented mysterious knowledge that appeared in his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time doesn't know how long it has been, Su Ge feels that his head suddenly bursts open, and after a sting, everything in the world becomes clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He heard countless subtle voices, heard the mourning of the soul, and even heard the harsh twist of the soul, the harsh sound of the squeeze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge suddenly took a breath and sat up from the bed, the shock was undecided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those mourning, those squeezing and distorting Suge's heart have produced intense fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After looking around, Su Ge found himself back in the bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What the hell is that? Is there such a ugly voice in the world?" Su Ge couldn't help but vomit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wiped the sea water on his forehead, Su Ge just rolled out of bed, just to see the second hag on the ground, looking at himself with a look of silly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
