			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For his younger brother’s whereabouts, Vanas is not clear, and Su Ge did not ask too much. He turned and asked: "If this is the case, why are you not? Going to the likes of the Berant Empire or the March Church for help?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas shook his head and said, "That is impossible, you may not know Our Guinness family used to be a member of the Berant Empire. At that time, it was the time when the entire Battle of the Bertrand was weakest. Our King of Guinness ordered the emperor to settle the war. After the rebellion, but because of The power of our family at that time was too great. For the stability of the empire, the Church of the Holy Blood, in the name of the pollution of the blood of our family, removed our family from the Church of the Holy Blood, and from then on, we were not allowed to enter the Belland Empire." Br?/><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“??” Hearing this Su Ge’s heart is a bit of a slap in the face, he didn’t know it at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas continued: "Fortunately, we were armed enough at that time, and we gradually opened up in that war-torn place, forming the current Guinness Kingdom." Since then, we have vowed that Guinness will never be included in the Church of the Holy Blood and accept their control."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge is silent, grasping the key points Asked: "Your eyes are blood red, normal human eyes are rarely blood red, and you have a special breath of death, what is going on?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas was shocked. She did not expect Su Ge to see her biggest secret as soon as she met. Without any concealment, Vanas said truthfully: "Our original eyes are green, according to the record because it was changed by the curse of the Church of the Holy Blood. The filthy red. Our family has been a family that can fight for a long time in the past. The long-term killing has left our ancestors with some bad breath, which has been inherited unconsciously."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"About when?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When is it not clear to me, but I feel it should be After being expelled by the Church of the Holy Blood, because the entire family was in a long battle during that time, the rumors of the ancestors were lying in a pool of blood."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “How long has it been now?” Su Ge seems to have caught some of the points and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s been about a thousand years!” Vanas still had some unclear why the apostles were so concerned about the secrets of these past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug nodded after listening, and then asked: "The church I founded and served my Lord is called the Church of the Night. I will be in the last few days. In the past, your kingdom was included in the shelter of the late bell.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Grateful! Apostle!” Vanas listened with great excitement and stooped salute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge raised his hand: "Don't rush to thank me, there are some details in the middle that need to be said."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You please say."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our evening church is different from those churches full of worldly dross, we serve the Lord Rarely involved in secular disputes, so this time we will not use the power of our church, but through the Church of the Holy Blood to help you solve this matter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Vanas was a little anxious after listening: "Isn't that..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Listen to me," Su Ge said faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas hurriedly shut up and listened quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Church of the Holy Blood and the Bertrand Empire owe your family. At this time, let them pay for the help of your recovery and reunification. You don't have too many ideas."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, they have a lot of terms for gestures, such as hoping that you will accept their rule again."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas listened to his fists and said: "Yes, their messengers have been here for two months, but they have all been rejected. We Guinness The family is dead! Even if it is completely ruined! It will not be put into the embrace of the Church of the Holy Blood again!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to this, Vanas is excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Cough, don't say this easily." Su Ge coughed, thinking of a real incense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immediately, he explained: "Of course you are not engaged in their arms, but in the arms of the late bell. For many years, I believe that you also want to retaliate against them?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear this, Vanas pinches his fist and whispers: "Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That listens to me, temporarily accepting them Domination, accumulate strength, and enhance strength. When necessary, you can give a deep blow to those who are self-righteous!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear this, Vanas eyes One bright, but then some hesitation: "But what if they let us hand over the autonomy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reassured, there is me, they still dare not propose Those unreasonable demands." Su Ge is confident in his voice and his voice is dull. The gas field is full. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emilia gave enough loose conditions to give Suger extra confidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This voice is very powerful, and immediately gave Vanas the strongest confidence and hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes! Everything obeys the orders of the apostles." Vanas agreed with great care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded with satisfaction, and with a look of a stick, he gently clicked on her forehead and said softly: "Don’t worry, don’t Anxiety, don't be afraid, don't worry, release your spirit, obey my will, the shadow of fear will dissipate, the breath of death will dissipate, the haze of war will soon be gone, peace and harmony will come. Come The Lord's children, dedicating themselves to everything, let us put all the burdens in the evening bell and integrate them into one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A long, heavy bell sounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas feels that his body is flying, she is lying on the clouds, bathing in the warm sunshine, the whole body is warm, there is a kind of can’t tell Comfort and happiness, as if your soul has been promoted to the legendary paradise, away from all the disputes of the world, in a pure and innocent world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle, she opened her eyes and found herself lying in the bath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
