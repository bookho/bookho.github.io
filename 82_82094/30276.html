			<div id="content">"The main reason is that we are very short of people now."<br /><br "Lack of people?" Su Ge stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerlos explained: "The situation in Bain City has been more complicated recently. There are not only death sects, but also two sneak sneak peeks, as well as some others. Dangerous organizations, and because of the update of the Trade Act, more foreign traders have come here, causing a lot of troubles, and there are many dangerous people in it. Because of the lack of psychics on the police station, once they encounter murder The case, fearing that there are mysterious clues, each case requires me to deal with it personally."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But people don't know, the church in Bain city There are not many mysterious people. The configuration of this second-tier city is very tense. Due to the special nature, the night watchman can only act at night and can't handle the daytime. The police station does not have a person who knows the extraordinary knowledge. These things add up to make me busy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Su Ge knows that the prestige hunter is not so good. of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The reason you know, then talk about the dangers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Second Point, I need you to help the police to check whether there are extraordinary factors in the murder. You have the ability to communicate with the deceased, it is easy to identify. This way I can release a lot of energy in the case of the police station. But you have to understand, insight Too many mysterious events can easily make the vision grow rapidly. The position of the psychic is not a battle compilation, so you can easily attract the attention of those who do not care."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Hearing this, Su Ge thought of this aspect, and suddenly there was a trace of fear in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Second: Your current heart is not good, you don't have your own career. You can easily collapse after seeing some horrible things. It leads to loss of control. At that point, we only have the choice to kill you." Speaking of this, Gerlos looked cold and without any mercy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Third: All your identities must be kept secret, and after becoming the spiritual media of the church, you must be monitored by the church. Without the permission of the church, you must not rashly. Leaving Lin Encheng."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fourth: Excessive participation in mysterious cases will attract the attention of other forces, and the probability of you being attacked by them will increase significantly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After these four points Jeros said faintly: "I have already said the pros and cons. You have to think about it. Although we lack people, we have not yet forced others to join us. In short, this is the job of changing money. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge has just cooled down and whispered, "Sorry, Master Geros, I need to think about it."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have a day to consider, come here to answer me tomorrow." Gerlos said standing up and going out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meditation to leave the police station, Su Ge has returned to his home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just opened the door, the second ha happily rushed over, lively around Su Ge and jumped and jumped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s face barely smiled, reaching out and licking the dog’s head in Erha’s head and sighing: “This life in the opposite world seems to be different from the plot in the fantasy novel. Too much. Under normal circumstances, shouldn't I give me a few years to develop slowly? Why did I suddenly give me such a high-risk job?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜呜......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two ha seems to feel the pressure of Su Ge, a scream in the mouth, holding Sug’s thigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lying on the bed, Su Ge looked at the dilapidated shack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When you join, you can get a monthly salary of 10,000 yuan, which can greatly ease the economic pressure at home, and can let Winnie and Black eat every day. Good meals. And you can formally enter the mystery."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the cost is huge, high risk, loss of freedom, and the danger of going crazy at any time. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temptation is huge, but the price behind it is terrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! Boom! ......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unconsciously, Su Ge heard the twelve bells and fell asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dream, he came to the frozen ship again, but it was different from the last time. This time he held a silver spear and sat directly on the supreme throne, accompanied by a lot of pale blue mist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Su Ge is not as boring as it was last time, but the spirit is as active as when it is awakened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where is this place? Where is the ship sailing?" Su Ge sat on the throne and fell into meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bell on the head is very irregular, sometimes it sounds once an hour, sometimes it sounds ten times a minute, very weird. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a spear, Su Ge found himself able to step on the air and calmly walked down to the throne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing on the deck, the outside is still foggy and can't see anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This...is my battleship!" Holding a spear in his hand, Su Ge’s instinctive flash of thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This idea is like instinct, and Su Ge feels that he has absolute control over the entire warship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, just feeling. Because Su Ge can't control this huge warship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What does it mean to come here in my dreams? I am the king of something? Why can I use this rifle? What extraordinary power can you give me here? What?” Su Ge’s heart is full of doubts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Su Ge meditated, he suddenly heard a whisper in his ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These whispers are not the whispers of the ancient gods, but a statement similar to prayer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are not many sounds, it sounds like there are only two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
