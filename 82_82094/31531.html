			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At half past three in the afternoon, Sug came back with an empty box and bought two pounds of big bones at the butcher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I got home, I saw the second corner of the sofa when I entered the house. The claws were holding the corner of the sofa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seeing Su Ge’s return, he immediately stood up, twisted his butt and grabbed himself through the sofa, and opened his mouth to stick out his tongue at Su Ge. Shaking his tail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge looked at the two goods silently: "What do you say is the mount of the gods! It is a giant wolf!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗷呜! Hey! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing that he was a wolf, he suddenly raised his neck and cried, his face smug, ignoring Su Ge’s hatred of iron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug helped the forehead and threw a bone into it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two ha hops half a meter high, open the mouth and bite the bone accurately, and open his long legs and squat in the corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;搓 搓 搓 哈 哈 哈 苏 苏 苏 苏 苏 苏 苏 苏 苏 苏 苏 苏 苏 苏 苏 苏 苏 苏 苏 苏<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today he is not prepared to show his talents, after all, his work has not yet landed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make delicious meals, spices and flavorings are essential. However, as far as the current situation is concerned, this family cannot afford the expensive cost of spices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prepared for a regular Western dinner in accordance with the memory of Suger Sotos<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6 pm Half, Winnie and Black came home, watching the hot meals on the table and the brothers sitting at the table and looking at the newspaper, and I was relieved to know that everything that was last night was not a dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The police station has already dealt with things?" Black asked, taking off his coat and a plush scarf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge put down the newspaper and said, "Well, I also reported the organization. The police have already started investigation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good job!" Thumb up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This little girl has a strong sense of justice from an early age. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the dinner table, Su Ge first said: "I met a former tutor today, and he is now a consultant at the police station."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How can a teacher in the history department go to the police station as a consultant?" Winnie listened to her blue eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough cough...that he is more knowledgeable, and he has a lot of research on criminal cases and the law." Su Ge, who just found an excuse, did not expect Winnie to do so. Quickly found the problem of this lie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wennie didn't pay too much attention to her brother's expression, nodded and asked: "After?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sug continued his performance: "When the police were assisted in investigating the fraudulent dens, the tutor saw my talent in criminal investigation. They just lacked a high-educated intern detective, so I wanted to try it. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black smiled and said: "Well, Su Ge does have the talent in this area. In the past few years, every day mysteriously said that people do not If you understand it, it is very similar to those who are holding a pipe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This spit is very deadly, and Su Ge could not refute it for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wenny thought about it: "Detectives are not a too dangerous job. It is actually a job for the police. It is quite good. How much is the salary?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge truthfully said: "The internship period is two months, 15 francs per month. If the internship period is qualified, it can be turned positive, every month can be Get 25 francs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"25 Langke!" Hearing this, the two men stood up and looked surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This 25 francs is one franc more than the wages of their parents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there some risk?" Winnie asked cautiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The salary is very high, but the two brothers are not stupid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug did not lie: "It is impossible without risk, but this is my best choice now. I have missed this opportunity without choosing to stay in school. Going to the factory or the newspaper to be a bottom-level worker, get a daily salary of 10 cents a day. I have spent more than half a year, I don't want your living expenses to work for you to earn."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, the two were silent and the atmosphere on the dinner table was somewhat depressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’an said: “But don’t worry, there is no risk in the internship. After becoming an official detective, you can get the protection of the Church of the Holy Blood, without your imagination. The big risk."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a lot of good looks when I heard the Church of the Holy Blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then go! As a man, you have to be responsible! It doesn't matter if you are tired and tired! And there is 100% safe work in the world?" Black said loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Being a worker is already very safe, but their parents are still suffering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge patted his shoulder and said, "This is my good brother."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Winnie nodded and said, "Okay, but be careful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After dinner, the two continued their studies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The free Su Ge picks up a Blackbook textbook, the first thing I see is the construction of the steam engine, and then the principle and mechanism of the differential machine. The construction principle of steam gear guns, as well as a large amount of mechanical knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at these words and the most complicated illustrations, Su Ge feels a little dizzy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black put down his pen and said, "Is the historian with detective talent ready to learn mechanical knowledge?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge smiled and put down the book and said, "That is Look, nothing else."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Su Ge did not bother him, with two haha ​​back to his room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Grandma! I only hate the computer information management I learned before, not mechanical engineering, here is a paradise for engineering students!" Lying in bed, Su Ge A look of regret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He now has a scientific knowledge of the future world, but he has no practice at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After playing for a while, Su Ge washed and slept directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dream, he returned to the ice warship and became the owner of death and storm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sitting alone in the throne, Su Ge once again felt the clarity of his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait!" At this point, Su Ge suddenly found himself remembering all the knowledge and illustrations in the book before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And after this high-level thinking process and calculation, those complex parts, mechanisms, and gears are instantly decomposed into disregarding easy-to-understand knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, Su Ge suddenly discovered that the principle and structure of this steam engine, differential machine, and neat gear rifle are too simple, as simple as 1+1= 2 the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where, Su Ge looked very happy and excited and said: "My day! I finally know what my real golden finger is, this god card The processor! With such a processor, all the knowledge in the world, all problems can be solved, and quickly transformed into the most knowledgeable and knowledgeable knowledge. This knowledge is the most precious and powerful existence!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Time! I need time! As long as I can give me some time, I can have great knowledge and strength. At that time, just take the earth's things and just pick them up. I can have a lot of money. I have the opportunity to provide the church with two inventions, and to raise the status to the bishop to get some land and manor, then I can protect and shelter more witches and have more powerful power. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
