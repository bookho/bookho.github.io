The ability, the speed is very fast, although the defense is not high, but the number is great, if it is close, the mysterious person at the dominator level will die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "They are very adaptable and can not only be suitable for extreme cold and extreme heat, but can even not eat for several years. It is praised by our army as one of the most dangerous existences in the abyss."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But fortunately, they can't leave the water and can't fly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to Andrew's introduction, Randall sees The dense insects in the pool sighed: "It's disgusting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge's face is not very good, the last time I watched the movie of the tomb adventure, every The times are inseparable from the disgusting mass of worms as the last disaster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, he left a lot of childhood shadows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now seeing this real scene, this makes Su Ge feel numb scalp, the whole body is goose bumps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrew looked at the opposite channel and asked, "What should I do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge calms his heart The fear, take a deep breath and say: "It’s good to fly over."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where, Randall took Andrew, and Su Ge flew through the black cloak This is a scary sea of ​​insects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the entrance of the passage, three people looked at the sea of ​​insects about ten meters from here, and quickly followed the passage down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The passage here is not steep and the shape is downward spiral. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire passage was very broad and clean at first, but as the downturn continued, a large amount of moss and wet vines began to appear on the surrounding walls, and the ground became More slippery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a drop of about 100 meters, the entire road approached flat, while three people also walked out of the passage and entered a solid brick The underground palace corridor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The underground palace is full of dust, but a lot of footprints can be seen from the ground, and it seems that a large number of people walked through it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The torch on the wall has already been extinguished at this time, and the front is very dark. It can be said that it is not reaching out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prepared Andrew did not know where to take out a very bright lantern to move on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This channel is very long and should be around 50 meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the advancement, there are more and more cobwebs around, and you can see fist-sized black spiders on the ground, as well as colorful scary snakes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looked around and found that there were some more embossed reliefs on the walls and some seemingly indescribable shadows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Close! Just ahead!" Andrew said, speeding up his pace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug immediately released the aftermath of the night clock, only to find that the material here is very special, the sound waves are completely absorbed by these walls, unable to detect and transmit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Be careful, this place has a big weirdness." Sug squeezed his cane and looked dignified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Randall’s eyes flashed with blood red, surrounded by dark bats, and looked at the situation with great vigilance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time passed another minute, and everyone suddenly found himself in a very bright place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very large underground palace with an indescribable shadow on the wall that seems to be slowly creeping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These shadows converge on the roof of the underground palace, forming an indescribable great existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be careful!" At this time, Randall shouted and pushed Sug away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next second, his body was directly hit and flew out, hitting the wall heavily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who!!" Andrew immediately squeezed the big sword and shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of the three people, there is an incomparably huge body that occupies one-third of the vast underground palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a pale skin with a festering, purple blood vessel and countless tentacles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to be an infinite number of times of the queen, her body is so bloated, huge, pale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the front of this bloated body, there is a female body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just a woman’s upper body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is full-bodied and she can’t see what she is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is full of disgusting blood, only one eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wore a worn crown on her head, and the white hair was countless squirming tentacles, like a mythical snake banshee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only, she is a banshee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is wearing a royal robe that has been integrated into her body, and she can see that she was a noble queen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the woman looked at the three people in a condescending manner, and made a voice full of majesty: "Invaders, you have come to the wrong place."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s eyes widened at this swollen queen, and his brows gradually tightened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can be sure that this form is similar to the swollen woman, but whether it is on the pressure or on the body, it is the swelling in the dream. Women are huge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrew looked at her with a dignified look, whispering: "Hand over Carl's skull, that belongs to our Wolf Blood Legion."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? Puppy, you are really big enough. You have been in the inner city for so many days, and it has been the greatest kindness to you since you didn't kill it. You dare to run here?" It’s cold and cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Andrew tightened the sword and said, "Is it? I want to feel your kindness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Then you will die!" The voice just fell, I don't know where the tentacles came from directly to Andrew. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Andrew is the top master warrior after all, and instantly propped up the defense of the sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;蹬蹬蹬! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three steps in a row, the giant sword plowed a trace of one meter long on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen does not seem to be planning to make a continuous shot. She turns her head and looks at Su Ge, who has remained silent. She has a hint of vigilance in her eyes: "Who are you?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge took off his hat and gave a slight salute: "Sug Sotos."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See Su Ge was so calm and courteous, the emperor later had some interest, the huge body squirmed slightly, and the body dropped some to look at Su Ge: "You are different from those who are ignorant."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug brought a hat and smiled: "Of course, I know a lot."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How much?" Queen asked Road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled casually: "More than I know, the source of your ability is from the swollen woman."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen’s one-eyed squad suddenly tightened and asked after a second of silence: “How do you know the name?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I also know a lot of names."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge said, spread his arms and looked at the empress with ease: "I have a little Very curious, who promised that you can complete the revival of Byrondias through the Holy Grail of the Soul?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen did not answer, and a large number of tentacles extended from her swollen body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time there are a lot of giant guards in the vicinity of the Imperial City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more weird thing is that these guards are not big in size, and they are covered with mucus, which seems to have just been born, giving a sense of vulnerability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Those soldiers are actually made by you." Su Ge looked at her bloated body and said suddenly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen sneered without answering: "When I eat you, I will know everything. Now you can die and become the great holy grail." Part."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge spread his hand and said: "As a polite gentleman, it’s not right to be motivated by women, and I hate to do it, I think you The contradiction between me should be solved with my mouth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen smiled: "Of course, I use my mouth. When I eat you, everything goes wrong. Solved."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, a lot of tentacles rushed along with other monsters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger’s body slammed back, and Andrew and Randall greeted each other, holding Su Ge behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dangdang...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pale white tentacle hits the giant sword and the glove , actually issued a burst of metal roar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrew’s constant parry defense asks: “Sogo, is there any way?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge looked at the giant soldiers around him, and the fierce tentacles, suddenly thought of a possibility in his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he took a handful of clothes in his clothes and took out a book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Her Majesty, let’s talk about the conditions!" Su Ge raised the book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The offensive continued, and the Queen asked coldly: "So, are you still qualified to talk to me about conditions?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge calmly said: "Of course, because of me Everything I know is in this book. I even know that a swollen woman is not a real god, it is just an incarnation of a great god."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, the Queen’s attack came to an abrupt end, with a deep shock and doubt in one eye: “You...how do you know this!?”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great existence, even if she happened to know it later, she thought that the whole world, only oneself knows this hidden great truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug swayed the book in his hand: "Of course it is seen in this book."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Give this book to me!" When I saw the book, the Queen suddenly screamed and the body suddenly rushed forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rumble...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With her forehead, the entire underground palace was bursting shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s okay, her body doesn’t seem to move too far. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lot of sonic blades in the hands of Su Ge and the book is wrapped in the middle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Her Queen, you should be careful, if there is any mistake, this book will be shredded by my sharp blade." Su Ge threatened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this, the body of the palace rushed to a halt, staring at Su Gehan coldly: "Do you dare to threaten me?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course it is a threat, or we will not die?" Su Ge's tone of calmness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time Andrew and Randall gasped back to Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bloated body, strength and speed are beyond the expectations of the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
