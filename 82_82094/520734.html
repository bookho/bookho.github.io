			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point everyone’s eyes fell on the ground Joel’s body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishop of the Church of Glorious Church is now squatting like a prisoner, with a pale face and no room to spare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other glorious church clergymen were pale and shivering, and they did not have the courage to face these monsters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people around are ready to listen to the conversation between the two people. When Joel just looked up and explained, the sharp swords flashed past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joel’s big-eyed head is out of the body, blood rushes out of his neck, and Vegginia kicks his head out of indifference Said: "I don't want to hear your disgusting voice. Now, go to hell and bear the eternal catastrophe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people around you look at each other, I don't know how to be good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, it is the bishop of the Glorious Church. Should you say something before you start? Or is it to advertise the crime? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a normal process! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Randall looked at Vegniya with approval, and he appreciated her decisiveness and directness, and was a good player. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to join the church in the evening clock." Vegniya turned back and looked at Randall seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well." Randall nodded slightly and stepped forward: "Go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Then five people followed the steady and calmly down the hill to the foot of the mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole process is surrounded by silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one dares to stop, no one dares to move, and no one even whispers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like these 800 people are like dead statues, they can’t talk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the watchful eyes of everyone with awe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thick bells wrap the body of five people with the cold wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few seconds later, when the cold wind dissipated, the figure of five people has disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome to the bell, go with the bell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The church of the late bells became famous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if the five people have left for a long time, these people have not returned to God for a long time, do not know what to do, what kind of expression to show. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took to break this dead silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was then Laurie’s body in the middle of everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Laurie looked too good, his face was pale, his face had this wound, and there was a lot of ice on his hair and eyebrows. At this time, it is still icing constantly, without the slightest melting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not Laurie’s powerful dark knowledge, I’m afraid his head will end with Sapir’s arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Laurie’s appearance at this time, everyone once again felt a chill in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white-haired man is just a master from the gas field! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gap between the master and the lord is like a cloud, and the master actually beats the lord of Laurie so! ? This is far beyond the limits of their imagination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"War!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This vocabulary, at this moment, is deeply imprinted in the presence The deepest part of the human mind, I am afraid that this life will not forget. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The floor of Laurie saw the situation around him, the face that was very bad was even more gloomy, his eyes slowly sweeping across the slopes, watching the squatting on the ground The Holy Swords and the Demon Hunter, watching the screaming players, looked at the sorrowful, stunned cleric, looked pale, succumbed to the three bishops on the ground, and finally saw the separation of Joel’s corpse The body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly he remembered what the inhuman existence had just said at the end of the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have already won."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fist is silently pinched, Laurie clenches his teeth . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monster did win, because under the great protection of the church in March, they killed the bishop of the church union and fulfilled the original promise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he has always had the upper hand in the battle, he almost killed the war at the cost of his own minor injury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s still a little worse, he didn’t kill it after all! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The evening clock!!" Laurie was filled with anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many years, the Church of March as the spokesperson of the goddess, for the first time suffered such a serious provocation and contempt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark star struggled in silence, his face was gray, and his voice said with awkwardness: "The Archbishop, please lower the punishment, I wait for the servant to make the goddess of the gods shameless." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lauri took a deep breath and asked calmly: "Now, when it is not said this, immediately gather the wounded, and build a battle camp here. Everything that happened just happened to me without any details."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a simple trim, everyone started normal operation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, the second wave of support for the Church and the Nighthawk Church has arrived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only a hundred people in their number, but they are also led by the Archbishop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two archbishops, like Laurie, belong to the secret internal archbishop, who has no name for strength and horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While looking at it, all three people know, it seems that they still have a good relationship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Archbishop of the Nighthawk Church has no name, single name, 枭. It is a woman who looks tall and looks very ordinary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Archbishop who cured the church did not say the name, only one name: the Holy Word. It is a middle-aged and beautiful man who is full of temperament and looks handsome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the occupation of two people, no one knows, no one dares to say, only know that these two are the lords. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time three people sat together and listened to the incomparable detailed report of the three stars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The frost on the hair of Laurie has already disappeared, leaving only a little bit on the eyebrows, and his face is very normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After seeing it for half an hour, these frosts can be completely dispelled by his knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listening to the incomprehensible detailed introduction of the three people, he first asked Laurie: "Sen's Black Goat? What is going on?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Laurie explained: "The bishop of Bain City is too high to flip, and in some way connects the Mori Black Goat and summons him. "嗣"."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of thing, two people's faces suddenly moved, the Holy Word asked: "Is that sure that this evening clock church handles?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At the time I asked the local residents and clergy, did not say that it was the church of the late bell, but did hear the bells, and there was a group of masked organizations in the city. Save the people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, the blasphemy and the sages are silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They really didn't kill one person?" asked the Holy Word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Horas statistics said: "Yes, the entire incident only killed one Joel Mick."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The higher vampire of the semi-owner level, the two master-level witches..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three are silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You three go ahead!" He said, looking up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three men retired after listening to the respectful salute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three people left in the big room at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you think?" Laurie asked the Holy Word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sages thought for a moment: "From their words and speeches today, as well as certain things that were once certain, their nature and the cold church The Institute of Polar Studies is different."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Their nature should be similar to the nature of the Wolf Legion and the Fortress." 枭 Make your own judgment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Laurie continued to be silent, did not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Worder nodded slightly: "It is indeed somewhat similar. According to the records, the Fortress and the Wolf Legion did indeed happen with our March church when it was just established. Many conflicts, even wars, prove their legitimacy through their own actions and values."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Laurie shook his head: "This evening clock is different, wolves The Blood Legion can help the kingdoms to accept the death penalty, and has a good reputation. The Fortress is now the last line of defense against the hunters. The most important thing is that these two organizations have the same bottom line as us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that he looked up and looked at the two: "But they are different, they are hosting witches, hosting high vampires, hosting female warlocks, and even planning to accommodate undead and more. The heterogeneity, their bottom line is far lower than us, and their potential danger is much higher than those of the two organizations."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear this, two people Fall into meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two of them just thought about the functional problems and behaviors of the church in the late hours, and forgot the members of this church, all of which were called heretics. people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the eternal bottom line of the March church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The March goddess is not wrong, and the church will not be wrong in March. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you accept heresy, or whitewash the heresy, it means they are wrong, this is absolutely not allowed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been many things since ancient times that they know that they are wrong, and they must continue to be implemented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because this is the majesty of the three churches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The March Church represents the will of the goddess, and their decisions will never be wrong! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the witch, the female warlock, the vampire and other creatures, the judgment cannot be changed or compromised anyway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What should I do? Want them all night? Determine them as cults?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Laurie said calmly: "This can only be done."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A little late church That's right." The Holy Word suddenly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people look at the same time, the Holy Word said faintly: "Our true enemy is not these heresy, but outside the starry sky, free in the stars Outside God. According to the most primitive teachings of the March Goddess, our first priority is to ensure that those outside God will not come again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But now, The tentacles of the Mori Black Goat have already reached out." The Holy Word said calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Laurie replied: "That was an accident."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the anchor has been left Come down." His eyes gradually became sharp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are not ordinary mysteries. They not only know the name of Mori's black goat, but also know his horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because twenty years ago, in March, the church had joined forces with this horrible god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three churches joined together and paid a very painful price to reluctantly send his avatar back to the astrology and promise that he would not Will enter again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The last time we were at our home, we have the blood of the great god as a container, keeping him inside. Waiting for the next time, we can't find the second. The direct descendants of a great god!" The sages whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laurie asked: "What are your plans?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Words said their thoughts: "The Wolf Blood Legion helps us to look after the abyss, not to protect the fortress." Looking after the city of trouble, is there an organization that will help us watch the stars?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lauri is silent, the words of the Holy Word are very reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;枭 calmly said: "I think it is feasible, since they can repel his sons without your interference, then they should also be from ancient times." A faction that has been circulated during the period is very familiar to all the gods. Otherwise, the monster that kills and kills can be repelled at such a small price?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "If this is the case, it can be said that they have a strong advantage for these foreign gods and the Yi people. If so, the March church may not be able to make some concessions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp Laurie whispered: "How to make concessions? Allow them to trample on the dignity of the goddess at any time? They are completely a group of believers. Can we allow them to shelter the witch under our eyes?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There should be room for negotiation here." He said calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lauri does not intend to continue the discussion: "This is the end of the matter, after all, we can't decide, hand over to those above!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other two people nodded in agreement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, now talk about what the city is!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the camp outside, all the clergy are very silent, bowing their own work, not talking, the atmosphere of the entire camp is extremely heavy and oppressive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three bishops sat together and did not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge also followed three people and comforted: "Work hard!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sapir, who had no hand, heard this and suddenly raised his head. His eyes faintly reddened: "There is no place for you to talk, you coward!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Suge has no choice but to spread his hand: "You are not an opponent of this group of masters. I don't even mention this expert. Going up is to die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; just said After that, Su Ge sneaked a sneeze and said innocently: "I was too cold with too much blood in the cold yesterday. I have a cold today and my condition is very bad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Horace looked up at Su Ge and smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that this smile is full of irony and disdain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They all know the true ability of Su Ge, although there is no master level, it should not be far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his use of sound waves, at least he can resist the Sonic Witch, replace the Dark Star, and attack the Master Pastor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark star is also very ugly, but after all, he is still a member of his own church. He resists the anger of his heart and whispers: "Since Sotos Bishop If you are not injured, go to help other clergymen to build the camp."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled and nodded and turned and walked briskly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, I don’t know why the hundreds of mysteries outside are not rushing into the city at this time, but are temporarily stationed on the hillside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that they are still immersed in the shock of the church in the late bell, and some are not returning to God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge put his hands behind him, standing on the edge of the camp and looking at the city on the top of the mountain, his eyes sparkling with deep light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first appearance of the Church of the Night Bell, ending in the most perfect situation, the remaining night clock will pass to the world through these mysterious people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic and Frost Witch are still safe, he can take back a lot of mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now all his attention is on the top of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Repair today, and more powerful troops will enter the city to explore tomorrow. According to Andrew, the horror of the entire city has not yet emerged."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three lords can It is said that this era is a big hand, and now the clergy and the mystery have combined to break through a thousand, plus the people who died before and the aborigines of the city, these sacrifices should be enough." Su Ge said Slowly squeeze the <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the Holy Grail of the Spirit is a must, which is the first and most important step in his realization of his ideals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Must be prepared for the perfection, that is the holy grail that symbolizes the origin of the world, but not just some sacrifices can be revealed, it should still be needed Some other important things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other side, in the cave on the cliff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss leaned up and leaned against the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can see his whole body full of sly wounds, pale face, even a large hole running through the abdomen, broken right leg, right thumb and ring finger completely Deformation, very embarrassing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jenny, who had just returned, was shocked and rushed over to help Jackos stop bleeding and then correct his leg bones and phalanx. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately after using all of their psionics, help Jelos recover the abdomen through the big hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only three centimeters, your spine bone was broken by this attack." Jenny looked ugly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss smiled slightly: "Injuring a lord, and living under his hands, it should be a glorious record."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Randall looked at this year’s one-fifth of the demon hunter, a heartfelt admiration and sighed: “You are a madman.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss is so aggressive that he is very impressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half an hour later, the wounds of Gerlos's whole body were almost restored, leaving only some shallow crusted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a whole new muscle around the big hole, and the intestines inside were filled from the gap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This method of maximizing the self-healing of cell growth is not costly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Gerlos was like being drained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Food, energy." Jenny wiped the sweat from her forehead and said immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound waves on the side rushed in and listened to the barbecue, water, bread, etc. that had already been prepared from the room on the inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just in case, Vegginia took out a blood medicine that could supplement protein and energy and inject it into Gerlos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This medicine is very useful. After five minutes of injection, Gerloston was reborn as if he had eaten spinach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jeros, who finally recovered, slowly stood up and put on his clothes, looked at the sound waves and frost and asked: "The cooperation here is over, the two decisions What?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two sisters looked at each other silently. The older one-year-old sounded a deep breath and said, “We want to see the great storm and death. Lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jenny faintly replied: "My Lord is not what you want to see, you can see, God can't look directly, you are not clear?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You mentioned the Kingdom of God before, we just want to witness what you said is true."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Frost said, with a bit of bitterness: "The biggest disadvantage of the witch in this world is that we don't have any faith, and there is no god who is willing to shelter us. If you say the real existence, you can even carry out the witch. Healing, we are very willing to join in and dedicate all our beliefs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He added: "Yes, not only us, we will spread through Save the witch." <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;Jelos listened slightly and nodded. "Well, I will take you into the Kingdom of God at night."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two people can't help but listen to the heart's accelerated beating. It is like a woman at the bottom of the emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The days of the day are quickly spent in repression and constant discussion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the people in the Misty Mountains can only enter, but the clothes of the late bell church, the power, the particularity, the domineering, etc. all go through a variety of ways. The March church and the entire mysterious world pass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intangible messages are always the fastest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Emperor of the Bertrand Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the night, Admiral Green looked at the information that had just come from the misty mountains, his eyes gradually widened, with a burst of horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sug Sotos, is this your bottom line?" Green's evaluation of Su Ge at this time has once again improved several grades. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Marquis, what should we do after that?" he asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green replied calmly: "Let's wait and see."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Guinness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty! Your Majesty!" Elena ran into the study of Vanas with her intelligence and even forgot to knock on the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time wearing a black tight dress, wearing a gold crown, Vanas is reviewing the documents, watching the breathless face of Elena’s cold face A touch of softness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong, so rash?" Vanas said, standing up, his hands slightly unfolding, stretching his body while showing the perfect body under the black skirt. The best of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illina quickly passed the information and said: "Sug, he succeeded!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;When it comes to Su Ge, Vanas’s brows are slightly wrinkled. As a result, the information looks down and the content is not much, but it is very happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas looked at not only the wrinkled frown, but also the rosy lips slightly tilted up, a look of joy and satisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You still have some use." Vanas was full of joy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illina came over and asked: "What should we do next?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The change, nowadays people's views on the church in the late bell are unknown, and the rash slogan will only become the target of public criticism." Vanas took the letter and sat down and answered steadily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the night church you said?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an aristocratic park in the League of Legends, the old man with a monocle asked Bart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bat touched his chin and said with caution: "It should be, this name plus the containment of vampires and witches at the same time, there will be no mistakes."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The two witches are the two you help?" asked the old man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart shook his head: "No, those two can be transformed, one is controlling the metal, and the two should be added later."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about this female pastor? This method of completely overturning the treatment is the first time in these hundreds of years." The old man pointed at the intelligence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart continues to shake his head: "There was no such thing at the time. It is estimated that it will be added later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" What about a vampire?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This I know, this vampire blocked the explosion while blocking the ceremony, and protected us." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man is lost in thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
