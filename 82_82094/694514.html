			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a dead silence, Father Cagnes’s low-pitched cough broke the oppressive atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of priests returned to God and found that the god of death still existed, only to know that what he had just seen was not an illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"French, what kind of gesture is this?" The undead hunter does not know the fear, but at this time they obviously feel their own thinking. Messy and blocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because everything that has just been witnessed goes far beyond the limits they perceive. Father Sini sat up a little and looked at the death in front of him and explained: "You can think of Him as the embodiment of a god."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Incarnation!" When you heard the word, everyone's face became strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have experienced the ups and downs of their own spirits at this time have been numb. After hearing the legendary vocabulary, their expressions became as strange as the Hasta Dais, and they looked very funny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The avatar from ancient times is the exclusive vocabulary of the gods, and even the saints who can be called "hi" are not qualified to use this vocabulary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because only that can reach the highest level of knowledge, after reaching the source of a certain knowledge, can form a completely independent self through the absolute mastery of knowledge . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the ultimate knowledge that the gods can master: life creation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this, it is also the reason why the Church of the Holy Blood is eager, fearful, and helpless for Myra. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The bell of the church in the late bells is actually the embodiment of the gods!?" There are very few mysteries who heard this, but Sok clearly heard it. This is the avatar of two words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sure enough, not only the inheritance of knowledge, but also the inheritance of cause and effect." Sok seems to think of important knowledge, a face And then more excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of the sudden death of this Huangpao man, all the Yi people had a commotion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It can be seen that the Huangpao people are leading these Yi people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the other nine Huangpao people did not have much emotion for the death of their compatriots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like a dead person has nothing to do with them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calling...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, there was a hot heat in the dark night Gale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of wind is like blowing from the hot desert, with a horrible heat and a sticky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This viscous rushes like a stream of water, creating a sense of suffocation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining nine yellow robes are motionless, seemingly like a statue, and the strange eyes under the dark hood look at these inferior creatures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This style is very strange and violent, all the clergy in the square are pale in a moment, the sense of oppression and suffocation makes them open their mouths, but finds that they can’t Breathe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French Sini, who was seriously injured, sat on the ground, his pale face smiled: "His anger is still coming."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This strange wind is not something that ordinary mysters can achieve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only one who can produce this power is the one who exists and sits on the throne of the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind blew Sog’s darkness and made the feathers of his wings undulating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strange power even caused problems in the conduction of the late waves of Su Ge, and the circular ripples turned into a crescent crescent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the first time, the power of his first night was suppressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no anger in the gods. This is just the aftermath of his awakening." Su Ge is still familiar with the gods, and he can feel the truth through this faintness in the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using a one-of-a-kind sacrifice, the king of yellow clothes that comes with Myra as a container, is a collection of all believers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, these Yi people, these Huangpao people are part of his body, the tentacles extended by his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The insignificant low-level Yi people are irrelevant to him, just an optional fluff on the touch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The yellow robes of the main tentacles are very important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug now breaks one of the tentacles, and the body that feels the pain naturally responds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This reaction is like a human being in a dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this random turnaround is a terrible disaster for human beings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hot and sticky wind is the most terrifying disaster for all humans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind blows away the fog under Su Gebu, leaving all the people behind him exposed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if this wind can be transmitted through the line of sight, passing through the sight of those who see the peeper in a strange dimension. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啊啊啊......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the screams of the darkness, the peeping The mysterious eyes were instantly melted by this strange wind and turned into two bloody blood holes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the aftermath of this wind began to absorb the moisture of their heads quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In less than three seconds, their heads look like they are decades old, full of dry wrinkles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no aftermath after the miserable cry. No one knows which peepers are born or dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sok is lucky, he has escaped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead of him dying is a piece of meat that can squirm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a dominator he knows by chance, giving him a gift. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This piece of meat is treated by special methods, creeping life. After the critical moment of sacrifice, you can awaken a powerful force and let yourself escape a death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he was not dead, he was still sitting on the ground in shock and his face was pale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meat in front of it has turned into a pool of blood, and then quickly evaporated by some heat, turned into dry blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not only that, his spiritual vision has grown by three points, coming to the very dangerous 80-point boundary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next step, he will face the horror of flipping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trembled palm slowly placed on a black notebook, his face was pale and his eyes were full of horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that it’s definitely a life of nine deaths. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he still wants to see, he is the witness, witnessing all the secrets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is his persistence as a mystery, his pride in inheriting this secret profession. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since ancient times, all witnesses have not had a hospice, the content of this notebook has been passed down through the lives and contributions of countless people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Sok forcibly calmed himself down, struggling to stand up from the ground, with a damn decision, look again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he was watching, his eyes turned into a weird gray, which seemed to have countless bubbles and rays, and seemed to be unspeakable. The existence of the infection assimilated in general. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This will be my life, this will be everything for me." Sok whispered blankly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge, who is greeted by this horror, is also somewhat surprised, or stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he feels that he seems to be different at this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not that you’re being suppressed by anything, but that it’s like liberating something, giving him an unprecedented sense of power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's bring the time back to a minute ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of this kind of sacred wind, the face under the Su Ge hood that was directly crushed without any fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can feel the wind quickly licking his body, as his body has fallen into countless swarms and quickly died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, he was not horrified, he did not turn his head, his fog did not completely dissipate, it means that these clergymen did not die directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If that's the case, let's revisit it, the king of yellow clothes." Su Ge put his hand in his arms and held the cold art. formula. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This technique allows him to have a powerful power against the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, just as he was preparing to launch the surgery, the change occurred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, the fog he has produced is about to be blown away by this hot wind, and even the body of death has come to the brink of collapse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, however, a lot of fog appeared again in his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This fog is still pale blue, but both in quantity and concentration, it has reached a level of horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a moment, the rich fog has extended to the entire square, and all the fog is completely connected with himself, achieving complete control and resistance to the hot wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is going on here?" Su Ge was a bit stunned, and after looking around, he found the problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, the heart of the ice that has been beating very slowly, the speed of the beating actually came to the normal level, what kind of stimulation seems to have entered, A state of excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What kind of secrets exist in this heart?" Su Ge's heart is full of doubts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the beginning to the present, the existence of the heart of the ice is not high, but it is indeed the key to his entire alien life from the very beginning to the present. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compass!噗通! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ice heart beats vigorously and rhythmically, from which it slowly flows out some secrets that Suge can't understand and can't perceive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge faintly feels that under the influence of those weird things, his own spirit and his own body have been greatly extended. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, Suger heard a strange groaning sound, and then the sound became a thick bell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Would you like to give your knowledge to me?" Between them, Su Ge felt a very long-term will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not a voice, nor a word, it is far beyond the human level, through the direct exchange of will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course!" The answer is not the will, but the voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This voice is full of low and heavy, full of magnetism that people want to admire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This voice has never been heard, but Su Ge has an indescribable familiarity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because this sound is almost exactly the same as the bell of the late bell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can even be said that the amplitude and volatility of the late bell today is imitating the sound of this being. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice does not know men and women, can not distinguish between young and old, people can not describe, can not imitate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle, Su Ge continued to hear the sacred voice like a bell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "With the late hours of countless years, it is now known that this is one of the seven holy grail."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Night clock? Holy Grail!?" Su Ge felt the will at this moment, the mind was blocked, as if all this had left him, leaving him uncontrollable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The seven sources are also seven thresholds. The cycle has been countless years, you are a god, but the dream is still, surrounded by beasts." Unspeakable will appearing again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sever the undead dynasty, clean up the blood of the world, kill countless Yi people, sit with hundreds of millions of dead souls, the throne of the bones has supported the sky, and the abyss also worships my feet. Unexpectedly, the end of the end is so boring, meaningless." The sound of the sacred voice of the voice came again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can pass on your knowledge, everything you follow with me. One failure, two failures are no problem, the power I can wait for can be passed on Go on, until you get to the right person, then everything will wake up, and this endless cycle will greet the sunrise because of the world's awakening."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The world lacks a heart, and He can't wake up." The voice came again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then we cast a heart, a heart of the world, can resist all animal nature, can connect countless worlds, can accommodate all thresholds, all the world Heart."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Possible?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The door to the outside world is already open, two The king of God accepts the call to come to this place. All causes, all fruits, and all the doors are ready. What we need now is a heart, a heart that we can't guess."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If this is the case, then there is something to be said, hahaha..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last one, End with a loud laugh that cannot be described by that voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Su Ge is not as good as before, he heard it very clearly, and remembered it very clearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like these two voices are intentionally told to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pump! thump! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the will to recover, Su Ge found his heart beating loudly, and a strange gray glow emerged from the fog, then quickly condensed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horrible hot wind continues, and the ground and trees around the square have been completely melted and turned into muddy mud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, a group of blue mist that emits gray light has not been affected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This fog is like a boiling, the surface is constantly undulating, like being covered by countless boiling bubbles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, everyone feels the vagueness of self-existence, and all time and space are distorted, seeming to indicate the advent of terror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time does not know how long it has passed, and Su Ge’s body is above the fog in a human gesture, with numerous fog bubbles that emit gray light around him. bubble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These bubbles keep squirming and condensing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the moments, these misty rays form a strangely huge eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This eye is a pupil with a body that is indescribably distorted and deep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug is lying in the middle, it feels that countless indescribable existences are rushing in his body, and countless energy that he cannot grasp and describe is injected through this eye. His body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this moment, everything is like being smashed and turned into a venting of energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, he is a barrel, and countless energy is injected into it, releasing a horrible shelling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
