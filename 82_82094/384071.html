			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at this chapter of yesterday, it was a bit of a slap, and the inner shock felt very uncomfortable. Yesterday a word was not written. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been very serious about these chapters recently, but I still see that my brother said that it is very watery. I am still confused about the definition of water. I am caught in it. Self-doubt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latest chapter, I watched at least seven or eight times before and after night, still some people do not understand where the problem lies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some brothers who say that I am too trivial to write, and said that there is a lot of unnecessary explanation to treat readers as idiots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To tell the truth, I have encountered a lot of situations before, even this book has appeared several times, slightly concealed, and someone will jump out and say what The bug, saying nothing to understand, led to my writing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some brothers who say that the focus is not obvious, they are very chaotic, and some brothers say that they are too dragged and intermittent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The core of this little climax is not what force and force, but the protagonist from the weak chicken to the bully, not forced to force the excessive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the protagonist is somewhat complicated, and because of the power system of this book, I have to explain the details in such a huge upgrade, otherwise it will be It is easy to have a fault. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may have noticed that the last big climax, the protagonist's battle did not improve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This volume is to make the protagonist from scratch, the whole volume of the paving and promotion are for the next major event, the next volume of the ancient god Whispering" to prepare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, I am definitely having problems with myself, but I don’t think it’s the kind of attitude that deals with the number of words, it should be my pen and story. The rhythm control is really not in place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These I am working hard to improve, you may not feel it, but in the process of writing, I really feel a little progress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
