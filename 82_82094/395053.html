			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evening after the ceremony, a grand dinner was held in the National Banquet Hall of the Royal Palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The banquet is very lively, including about fifty people of the Church of the Holy Blood, including bishops, deputy bishops, ministers of some departments, and related clergy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there are almost 80 people in Guinness here, the old aristocrats after the war and the new aristocrats, all with some identity and fame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The banquet started from six o'clock and was held for four hours. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It ended smoothly at 10:30 in the evening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were people with a happy smile on both sides, and they left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At 11:30, a relatively secret conference hall in the Royal Palace, about 30 people are sitting here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are fifteen people on each side of the neat rectangular conference table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doing two people in the right position, Vanas and Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are all the core talents of the entire country today, including Vanes’s confidant, Elena, the one-eyed deputy commander in the battle, Old Green, and Old Green's boss, who was the commander-in-chief of the battle at the time: Knox, a quiet, refined middle-aged man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to the military, there are ministers and nobles who now have power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person sitting here has mastered 80% of the resources of the whole country and is the core of Vanas’s rule. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, everyone here is a werewolf, with the help of Su Ge to restore reason, and absolute loyalty to the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now, everyone knows?" Vanas asked solemnly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just now, she has shown a showdown with the crowd, told them about the existence of the church in the late bell, told the faith of the Lord of Death and the Storm, and told the Pope of Su Ge Identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, in order to maintain her queen's identity, Su Ge said that Vanas is the deputy pope of the church today. Of course, he is also planning to do so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We can get such resources under such a loose policy, which is the means of the Pope. Our true faith is the Lord of Death and Storm, now only "The expediency."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After everyone heard it, a 30-year-old nobleman tempted: "At that time, the Pope eliminated the power of the cult and saved. The Queen of the Living Queen, let us restore our intellectual ability, is it the god of death and the storm?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, that is my help with a trace of my Lord The power," Su Ge said calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to the crowd, they were shocked. These people were there at the time and clearly saw a series of huge changes in Sugna. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the future, our Guinness Kingdom will become the Holy See of the Church of the Late Bells, and we will receive a sanctuary that truly exists and can reveal the gods of God." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard the Queen’s words, everyone in the room jumped in the air, which was a huge temptation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jean went on to say: "We become a werewolf in other people's eyes as a monster and a heresy. There is no place for us in the world. Fortunately, we are His Majesty the Pope has a broad mind, accepts us, and gives us shelter and guidance to prevent us from returning to the chaos of the werewolf."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, numerous The nobility did not hesitate, stood up and bowed, and said loudly: "When you see the Pope, the Lord of Death and Storm will be the only faith of me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Su Ge sat down in a slight nod: "Good, I can feel your determination, but your piety and loyalty will take time to verify. This Holy Blood Cathedral, you can be our evening church. For the time being, I need you to cooperate with me to maintain the unity and closeness of the Holy See throughout the region. There can be no differences. I will gradually arrange you into the church so that you can get more benefits."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heard as Affordable, then suddenly all the aristocratic smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although the church is built, it is now a waste of time. You need to work harder. My goal is to make the entire city into an absolutely safe city. In the future, even the entire mysterious world. So, I ask you. In the future, use your resources to absorb the trustworthy people into the church through the most hidden means. Remember, to be trustworthy, we are now asking for the elite, not the quantity!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes! His Majesty the Pope!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The side of Vanas reminded: "If the Holy See uses our Guinness, Is it too eye-catching?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge raised his hand slightly: "Reassured, I have plans."<br /><br />&nbsp; After the time, the people discussed in detail the details of the future plan. Su Ge also said the purpose and development goals of the church. Finally, he said: "The Lord not only has the power of death, but also the master of dreams. In the night's sleep, the Lord's Knight will take you into the Lord's Kingdom, ready Their attitude, that there is not any gaffe "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;! & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; hear this, everyone staring, after a burst of magical reality, full of an air of excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mill’s eyes are full of light, and the heart is also looking forward to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep into the night. All the nobles dreamed of a knight who was so powerful that they felt suffocated and even fear appeared in front of themselves, with a fog that passed through them to a quiet, full of fog and ghosts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they thought it was a dream, they saw other nobles, saw Master Mill, and finally saw Her Majesty the Queen and the Pope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My God!" For a time everyone’s eyes widened and they looked at the sky for a long time and returned to God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irene was completely stupid, and a familiar voice came: "Is it very magnificent, sacred?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard it, I saw Hill and Randall coming from the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The real God of the time!" Mill looked at the giant wolves and ghosts wandering in the fog, and the guards and wolf cavalry surrounded by expressions, full of demeanor Shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge calmly said: "You are too weak to qualify for the Lord's voice. You can't understand the four principles of God."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All people wake up like a dream , hurriedly nodded to understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Apostle!" At this time, Chuck, Pamela and other knights full of terror and pressure came over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes under the wolf helmet swept slowly across the crowd, and everyone suddenly felt that their soul had fallen into the ice of hell, an unspeakable despair and The cold surrounds you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a thick bell rang, and everyone was sweating all over the body, pale, and the body trembled back, violently breathing, almost sitting on the ground. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the respite, they heard the words of the Pope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At this time, the believers of my Lord, put away your pressure."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Voice just Falling, these people feel a sudden drop in pressure and vomit a deep breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My God! Just a look, how powerful is this knight!" Old Green was thinking with trepidation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time Prince Zeon looked at the knight who was respectful to Su Ge, his heart was full of shock, he found that the Pope is definitely not just the Pope. Kind of identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others have also noticed this, especially Mill and Elena, as well as the Army Commander Knox. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three people look at the laughter, the calm Su Ge, the heart is more awe and respect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, since you have witnessed the power of my Lord, leave quickly and don't bother my Lord's rest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no hesitation after listening to the whole, the chicken nodded like a glutinous rice, and then squatted on the ground, with endless respect and piety, and bowed to the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, a thick voice like a scepter hitting the ground came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this voice, everyone suddenly felt a huge giant, stepping on his soul and letting their souls explode. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This...this is the power of the gods!?" Everyone suddenly felt turbulent and completely stupid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the voice of the gods, just the random crash! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Have you heard this sound? This is the voice of my master’s scepter striking the ground of the temple, which means that my Lord feels your courtesy and Respectfully, I am satisfied with your attitude. Then if you offer enough piety and faith, you can even get the gift of my Lord, well, go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Subsequently, in the unsettled sluggishness of the people, they were taken away by the wolf knight and returned to their dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, when these people gathered again, they saw the paleness and fear of each other’s face, no need to talk, everyone knows, Everything last night was true! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the morning hall, the refreshing Vanas and Su Ge came out from both sides at the same time, and the mouth looked at everyone with a smile! Yesterday, can you sleep well?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good! Of course!" The people hurriedly adjusted their own manners and said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge satisfied with a nod: "Remember what we said yesterday, your vows."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes!" The crowd immediately took a solemn and solemn response and was very serious and solemn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this, Su Ge and Vanas smiled at each other, and the plan for this step was perfect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After some heavy morning meetings, a bodyguard hurriedly said: "Reporting Bishop Sotos, four middle-aged men and women came, said to find You are your friend."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
