			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, after breakfast, Su Ge and two people walked out of the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger got a lot of valuable information in the mouth of the female ghoul yesterday, as for the female ghoul, Su Ge and Did not kill, but through the ceremony, sent her into the Kingdom of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not just the spirit, but the flesh also enters the kingdom of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The method is naturally sacrificed as a sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today's goal is very clear, that is, the previous captain of the night watchman is completed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. 4431 Yaoyang Street, located in the north of Huiyao City, and is a relatively old and old town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From here, it takes more than an hour to get on a steam locomotive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today is exactly Monday, and two people have already missed the morning peak, and there are not many people on the entire steam locomotive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two sitting in the middle of the left side, Su Ge looked at the buildings on both sides and suddenly asked: "If such a magnificent city is in the end, The loneliness and absurdity of loneliness and no one should give people a special kind of romance and art."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley listened faintly: "Premise Yes, then you can clean up the horrible monsters on the street."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg heard this and sighed: "I hope this day will never come. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has witnessed a similar scene, and that time, tens of thousands of people died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley knows what he is thinking, and changes the topic and says, "How much do you know about those outsiders?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge indulged and said: "I still know something."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley nodded: "Should someone be staring Come on, let's be careful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge's demeanor: "Who?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley shook his head: "I don't know too well. His memory was very disfigured when he first merged. I don't know too well. I just remembered some relatively low-level and shallow relationships and old days. I don't know much about some of the higher levels of existence."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge reached out and held her hand with a black gauze glove: "Nothing, there is me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have What use?” Xue Lier asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge calmly replied: "Nature is to protect you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I need your protection "What?" Shirley asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No need?" Su Ge followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shelly thought about it and silenced it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can you protect?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If I really push me to a dead end, I The channel that will forcibly open up a dreamland will come." Su Ge seems to be talking about a very casual decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley is somewhat upset: "Do you know what it stands for?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug Nodded, no words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't want you to be that cold." Shirley took Sug. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge grinned: "That was forced to the road, with my current means and connections, dealing with the incarnation of some gods, the problem is not big. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Shirley leaned slightly against Suge's shoulder, and the atmosphere became peaceful and happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seventy minutes, the two men came to a shabby, very old town, standing in front of a three-story, old apartment . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red brick wall before the apartment was covered with smog and turned black. The wooden frames on the windows were old and lacquered, and the glass was dirty and there was no new brilliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outer door of the black paint has been dropped a lot, the inside of the bracket also gave birth to yellow rust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the apartment is dilapidated, it can be seen that it is very clean and tidy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug took the key and walked in, going down the old stairs to the second floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some kind of old-fashioned old people who live here. From the perspective of attire and accessories, they are all retired ordinary clerics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the two people dressed today are not outstanding, very ordinary, and they have been treated through the Holy Grail of the Soul, so the old people who are chatting are not paying attention. To two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go to Room 221 on the second floor. There is light dust in front of the door. It seems that the owner of the house should have not returned for about half a month. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open the door and walk in. This is a two-bedroom, one-bedroom room with an area of ​​about 70 square meters. The overall layout of the room is very simple, only one in the living room. There are no wooden tables and four wooden chairs, sofas and coffee tables. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The walls around are clean and tidy, with no murals and decorations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room on the south side of the hall is a bedroom, the twenty-five flat area has only one wooden bed, the top of the bedding is neatly arranged, and the bed has a brownish yellow Simple desk, on the right is a wardrobe like a big wooden box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this, this can’t be called simplicity, it’s simply simple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second room is not a second bedroom, but a study room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are all kinds of books in the study room. Su Ge looked around and was shocked that the contents of the books were all handwritten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are at least five hundred of these books?" Su Ge looked around and was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley opened a copy of "The World's Basic Elements" and looked at the neat black pen inside. The tone calmly commented: "Although this behavior is stupid, this little guy is not stupid, he just puts Copying a book is a way of pastime. From this font, I can feel that he likes the process of copying books and enjoys it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at these hundreds of books Thick books, Su Ge looked at the simple and extreme house outside, found that the only amateur fun of this night watchman captain is actually copying books. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This life, he can actually stick to it." Su Ge clenched his fist and felt a little uncomfortable inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley put the bookwork back in the tone, with a special tone in the tone: "The book can be concentrated, immersed in it and forget a lot of unpleasantness." "Things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge was silent, the sad words of the captain before his death, and the appearance of relief appeared in Su Ge’s memory again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Putting the book back, Su Ge released the night bell and found the money bag that the captain said in the secret cell under the desk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But while discovering the money bag, Su Ge also unexpectedly discovered that there was a special thing behind the bookshelf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thing is covered by special materials, the conventional perception is not known, and Su Ge still feels there through the vibration of the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After taking the money out, Su Ge pushed open the bookshelf, touched the wall and found the dark space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the mysterious shell, Su Ge found three shabby books inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Diary?" Shelly came over and looked at it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge flipped through the dilapidated cover of the book, looked at the contents inside, and nodded and said, "Well, from the content, it should be that he became a night watchman." The diary has been recorded since then."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing at the beginning, it is some daily life and experience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
