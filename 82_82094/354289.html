			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge’s expression was very calm, staring at the mask man: “Your purpose has been reached, it’s best not to continue to intervene.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the mask of the mask man, a bitter smile came out: "If you can see it, you will never say such a thing. Our goal now is very simple and we want to live." Its requirements are not high, so I can temporarily control you, we will not be against you, I hope you can understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, I can't understand." Su Ge's body began to struggle, and his face was full of no sorrow and no joy, and it seemed to give people an inexplicable sense of oppression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Masked man sighed: "You can't see it, so you are safe, but I am different, I saw it, so don't struggle, we twins The ability of the Alliance comes from the great black blood Gemini. I temporarily paralyze your muscles through the temporary local coagulation of the blood. You are temporarily unable to move."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hula! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suge’s eyes suddenly burned two blue flames, and the fists slowly squeezed, seemingly struggling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What?" Suddenly seeing Su Ge’s dual-purpose changes, the mask man’s heart suddenly jumped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two flames do not seem to be aggressive, but they represent a very serious possibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The form of this guy does not seem to be an ordinary human form. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, how can humans burn this strange flame? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is he? Is it a devil? Or what other devil!?" The mask man is constantly thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Su Ge’s voice passed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I control my blood through psionics? Your means are no different."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thick bell didn't know where it came from, directly smashing all the external psionics in Su Ge's body, and the stiff body quickly returned to normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is this possible!" Suddenly, Su Ge was like a broken puppet, and he lost his mask to the man he was in control of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug is now slamming his back in the waist and taking out the ice skull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If I were you, I will try my best to leave now. You don't know what kind of existence you are provoking. You may be threatened by the Yi people. Temporarily alive, the egg you spurred his existence, and will endure the endless catastrophe of eternal life!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the voice falling, the cold flame rises in the skull . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hehehe...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a weird, low smile, two flame elves from the flame Separated and surrounded by Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this ghost thing!?" Feel the cold flame like a thousand years of ice, the corners of the mask under the male mask are constantly twitching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This strange flame he saw for the first time, while feeling a fierce danger in the flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are not a member of the Church of the Holy Blood!" The mask man shouted, taking a step back cautiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of thing is not the power of the March goddess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge approached further, the cold tone replied: "Leave away immediately, otherwise the Lord of the Frosty, the blazing blaze of the King of Hunting will completely devour you The soul."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Lord of the White Frost...the king of mad hunting..." Hearing these two names, the mask man’s heart could not help but tremble stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he has not heard of these two names, he has seen similar names in the history books. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, this strange flame is somewhat similar to the record. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't the ancient king wake up again??" The mask man didn't know what the brain had made up. He suddenly yelled and turned his head and ran with Julie. The two men didn't care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the two people’s bodies seem to use a secret, flashing a stench of blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In silence, the ground beneath the feet of two people suddenly exploded, as if they had been blasted by the rocket launcher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know if it’s an invisible attack, or the effect of two people’s mystery, and the two disappeared and disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Accounting for your knowledge, when I see you next time, I am in a good mood and will probably leave you a life." Su Ge finished, the flame in the hand . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he doesn’t know what the guy’s brain has made up, it’s best to be able to scare him away. He doesn’t want to be with two masters at the same time. Level war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the killing of Randall’s Yi, he is not worried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know who is fearless, I can’t see it, and it can’t hurt Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since the Yi can't hurt me, it's a lot easier." Su Ge has been worried that the Yi can directly shoot himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, he is down inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Oliver here has a lot of welts at this time. Although there is no bleeding, it is also red, as if he had just used his "master" The whip is finished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are not many high-skilled Yi people who will actively abuse the abuse. From the traces of the whip, it seems to be similar to some tentacles. In combination with today's circumstances, This is what the Yi people, I have already guessed more or less." Su Ge thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knowledge of the relevant Cthulhu that his mind acquired on Earth seems to be unaffected by the system of vision, and there is no problem in thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oliver, who had been pumped a meal here, stood up in a gloomy face, staring at Su Ge with both eyes, whispering and hoarsely said: "Small nephew, lost the helper, you are nothing, I will Take your soul out and wash my failure!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his opinion, Sug now loses the help of the Twin Alliance and Randall, already It is a waste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a double-eyed, whispered a few words, before the huge ghost of ghosts shrouded his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no positive response, Su Ge did not feel anything, at this moment, looking directly at this huge ghost, Su Geton felt a burst of exudation from the soul. The cold spread throughout the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Invisible pressure seems to be on his soul, making him feel like he is carrying a hundred pounds of bricks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good physique, this should be complete crushing of quality and quantity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; At this moment, the claw of the huge ghost quickly swung over here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug immediately propped up the night clock, while pulling out the pistol in his hand and raising his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just at the moment of shooting, Su Ge suddenly felt a horrible sight staring at himself behind his own, and his eyes flashed a pair of bloodshot Full of sly and frantic eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the hair was upside down, and Suge suddenly turned back and found nothing behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fear! It's bad!" Su Ge thought of it at the moment, but it was already late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Sugg's return, an indescribable coolness permeates into Su Ge's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, Su Ge felt his body torn out with three sharp wounds by a sharp claw. The unspeakable pain and nausea filled him. spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪嗒! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
