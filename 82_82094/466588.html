			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge certainly does not say that he is the god of dreams. After all, he does not intend to pull Green into the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The church's doctrine and goal Su Ge is very clear, this is a church belonging to a few people, here is the fate of those who are persecuted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asked and laughed, Su Ge said: "I am not the kind of person who is idle and has no trouble running to other people's dreams. I still have a lot of things to deal with. For a long time, you are the first person qualified to let me enter a dream conversation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard this Green was very surprised, and said: " I am very honored."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sughaha smiled: "I hope we will be in the real world next time we meet!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, the body suddenly disappeared as if it were moving in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the departure of Su Ge, the whole dream is broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green lying in bed calmly opened his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moonlight barely illuminates the thick curtains, and Green slowly starts to open the extravagant electric lights on the bed, looking at the patterned ceilings, with The faint muzzle's mouth is slightly tilted up: "Sug Sotos, I hope you don't let me down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, everything is ready Su Ge, who is a bishop, did not have any farewells, and drove the carriage calmly out of the Cathedral of the Holy Blood, just like an insignificant little person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's too much!" Griffin in the carriage was very gloomy and very angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug, sitting in the car with a black cloak, feeling the second side of the street, looking through the window at the magnificent Cathedral of the Holy Blood: "Reassured, we Will come back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the carriage was about to leave the city, one person stopped the carriage and walked in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge threw the bloody sacrifices to the incoming Morris Road: "I have been frozen by me, as long as you don't die, you won't wake up. ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Morris carefully took the hockey catch and said with a respectful attitude: "The Marquis will not forget your friendship."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, go!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The farewell person has already bid farewell to it, and Su Ge is very smooth and calm out of town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Church of the Holy Blood Church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What!? The sacrifice of blood is in the hands of Suger Sotos!?" Nell heard the return of his subordinates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subordinate priests nodded: "Well, the news from the mouth of the mysterious person who just caught."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This gives the damn heresy, the thing that has harvested this danger is not handed over to the church, but wants to take it for yourself!?" Nell's eyes are full of coldness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Bishop, he should have not yet gone far, let's go chase!?" asked the sergeant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nell shook his head: "No need, when someone dies, everything will belong to the church."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear this, the god official smiles coldly and suddenly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is the central investigation?" asked Nell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest immediately nodded: "According to the news from the healing church, the initiator of this event is the Byron Dias, and the subsequent message needs Further confirmation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is it so slow?" Nell looked unhappy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sergeant’s body is deeper: “We don’t have a holy grail document for the rule. If you want to determine the source position, you need the saints to take the shot. So it will take some time. ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nell took a deep breath: "A group of waste, this small thing actually needs the saints to shoot? Can ensure that we are the first to find the location What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It should be no problem, the saints only need to take the shot, his big astrology can be very accurate to determine the source of the event through the body of the witch."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then let him live a few more days and make some modest contributions to the church before he dies."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The journey from Bain City to Guinness Not too far, but at the speed of the carriage, it still takes more than a day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three or two carriages on the way home, two for the person, one for the Suger in Bain City Physical. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now Su Ge himself is sitting in the carriage, and Lobo is on the side, very relaxed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Griffin has not had a good rest recently because of Emilia’s problems, and Sogo let him rest in the carriage behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scenery along the way has already been seen. I don’t need to watch the second time at this time. Su Ge took out the frantic book that has not been seen for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The book of Frenzy is not big, it seems to be only the size of an adult's slap. The whole book is scarlet, like a blood immersion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The material of the book is rather eccentric, not like paper, nor leather. But just touching it, it gives people a sense of shock, which makes people very uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are not many pages, it seems to be about thirty pages, each page is very thick, like the skin of an animal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening the first page, Su Ge saw countless twisted lines, which were very messy, like a mess of clutter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge doesn't even know where these lines start and where they end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at these messy lines, Su Ge did not rush backwards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Frenzy is one of the original attributes of Assos. This book should carry some of its attributes and knowledge, and the material and look tell me this book. The extraordinary point, that is, this book is not a fake. Since it is not a fake, there are some important things in this line."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Staring at these lines, Su Ge looked seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gradually, Su Ge felt a violent vertigo feeling, and then did not know whether it was true or false. Su Ge saw the lines above it start to wriggle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the scope of this creep is getting bigger and bigger, like countless bugs, like countless pythons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They squeeze each other, entangled with each other, and then separated by invisible things, then squeezed again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! Hey! Hahaha! ......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A burst of madness, tears of heartbreaking, laughter, screams gradually sounded in Suger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intellect is the shackle of freedom, and frenzied is free! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless people messy, crazy calls, passed to Su Ge's ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Su Ge’s eyes are wide, and his demeanor does not know why he is so incomparable, like a ghost of eating people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The breathing is getting heavy and heavy, and the chest is as dramatic as the bellows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time passed slowly, and some of the subtle red hairs gradually appeared on Su Ge’s face, growing slowly from the pores. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the book in the hands of Su Ge, the squirming lines have turned into countless tentacles, extending from the book, gradually approaching the face of Su Ge, to Go in his mouth and nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗷呜呜呜...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, a weird wolverine is suddenly in the carriage It sounded in the middle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get out!" Su Ge seems to feel something here, suddenly slamming, and the thick bells are coming out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pump! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, this bell seems to have hit Su Ge himself, only to see Su Ge slammed into the back of the carriage, his eyes closed, violent Breathing, hard to close the frenzied book in your hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know if it was because of Su Ge's awakening, or the book of frenzy was closed, and the large amount of red fluff that grew out on Su Ge's face slowly retracted into Su Ge's body, as if lurking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge closed his eyes and spent an hour before he barely opened his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was discovered that Su Ge’s eyes were filled with scary blood, and the clear and clear eyes had become cloudy and blurred, as if they were contaminated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wang...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, stand up, big dog sticks over, stick out tongue 舔Su Ge’s cheek, a look of concern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug’s somewhat sluggish look at the frantic book in his hand, hoarsely said: “Astos is not the Atstos, even this power. The corners of the corners can make me look like this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just now, Su Ge can be said to have experienced the most terrible of his coming to the world. feel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He feels his body is occupied by something horrible, after that horrible thing grabs his soul and throws him into a gray world in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing in the gray world, but everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is like a dream world, everything is illusory, everything is real. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw countless strange monsters there, but could not use any of his power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he can only run. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he can’t open those monsters when he runs, the most horrible thing is that in the center of the world, there are bursts of harsh, horrible horror People are listening to the mental breakdown, eager for some kind of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Su Ge couldn’t hold it, and was about to be assimilated by those monsters, a clear wolf came from his ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner of this voice has an indescribable connection with him, the sound penetrates countless worlds, countless spaces come here, and only one can use it Channel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
