			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I walked out of the temple, Vanas felt it all like a dream, looking down at her long, slender hands, she could feel that she had some special the power of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the power of the Lord! This is the Lord's recognition of himself, this is the gift of the Lord to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the gods, Su Ge appeared silently beside her, laughing and asking: "How do you feel?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas slightly daggers and pinches his hands: "I feel a little unreal, some dreams."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The position of the Pope is not Anyone can do it, don't let the Lord down," Su Ge said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas nodded hard and looked at Sugue, who was relaxed: "What is your position in the new system?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looks at the front: "According to the Lord's instructions, I am the human being who can best understand the main thoughts and thoughts. Therefore, there will be a "People Holding the Bell" above the Pope. Position.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Sug turned to look at the big clock on the temple: “The meaning of the person who holds the bell of the bell, supervising the entire church Movements, including your rule, to ensure that church development does not deviate from the original intentions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, Vanas nodded: "Well, this position is very important, you are very suitable for this position, the main thoughts are not what I can speculate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For me still in your head Nothing is dissatisfied?" Su Ge asked with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas shook his head slightly: "You are a benchmark and a hero, but you are not a qualified leader and ruler. You are not a Pope. The gas field, there is no attitude to rule the congregation, just like your attitude towards Elena and Mill. In your thinking, since everyone is persecuted, they should be equal to each other, regardless of the priority. When it's less, it's okay, but when there are more people, there will be problems."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger said with a wry smile: "You see it thoroughly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I saw it before, but it was because I lost myself and didn't dare to swear to you, but it is different now." Vanas said, looking up, the proud body stood straight, and the spirit was high, and the king was on the verge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled: "Then I will hand it over to you, and I should recycle my spirit to do something more meaningful."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For example?" Vanas Liu's eyebrows rose slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For example, look outside and see this colorful world. The Pope is a cage for me, now I am handing it to you, I want to go to the world. In a circle, look for some answers in my heart."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanas is very satisfied with Su Ge’s answer: "Good luck."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Vanas left, Su Ge returned to the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After that is the matter of Father Water." Su Ge raised his hand, four beautifully clear, style and color of different heraldry appeared in front of him . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Apocalyptic Storm Hunting, which represents my four strengths."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sickle, Representing the power of my death, the meaning is the death of the apocalypse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The scepter, representing the power of my dream power, means the plague of the apocalypse." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Great Sword represents the real power of my hunter. It means the war of the Apocalypse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Flame, representing the power of my fog. It means the absurdity of the apocalypse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The four apostles will inherit my four distinct forces, In the end, they can even evolve into a semi-divine existence through contact with me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The candidate for death has been selected, then let's get started!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you want to finish, order the knight to bring the old Father of Water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cathedral of the Holy Blood in Bain City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father, after listening to the bell, stood up with a cane and sat by the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; took a sip of water, he lay on a very simple wooden bed, covered with a worn cup to sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will sleep cautiously for two hours every day, hoping to get the call of that one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They have noticed me, and if I can't do it today, I won't continue to take risks." Father Waterer slowly closed his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For him, sleep is a very dangerous thing, and dreaming is equivalent to suicide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has lived for more than ninety years, but he has barely slept since he was thirty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t want to sleep, but I don’t dare to sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inheriting the special abilities of the ancient gods, it became a secretive occupation that is taboo, coagulation. He was appointed as one of the four guards guarding the maze of blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought that the power of the ancient gods can make you see more knowledge and more convenient to reach the root of knowledge, but what he did not expect is to wait for his own It is endless pain and fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He once had a dream and paid a heavy price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That time, when he woke up from a nightmare, one of his legs was taken away by that horrible thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Escape from the Labyrinth of the Holy Blood for many years, away from that connection, allowing him to temporarily enter shallow sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this sleep can't last too long, otherwise they will find him again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incoming into the dream, Father Watert wore a worn trench coat with a gray jazz hat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not have his left leg, but his position was very stable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holding the big scalpel with rust, the whole body is tense, and there is no easy sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is still an hour." Father Water calculated the time accurately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is at this moment, a lot of dark lines suddenly appear in the dream of awkwardness, followed by a pale white non-human palm suddenly from the gray dream barrier Stretched in, followed by a tear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, an indescribable horror monster appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This monster is five meters long, and the whole body is pale with a fold like dead skin. It has six hands, no eyes, and a plaque on the back and belly. The big mouth, while the head of the front section, has three human skulls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So so fast!?" Walter squeezed the sickle and looked nervous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After waking up, there is only one dead road, not killing this monster, it will eat its own soul through dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monster is very fast, and after it appeared, it came to Father Warren almost instantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Father Water is also very fast, the body instantly turns into a gray wind, the next second appears in the attack two meters away from the monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he scolded, an invisible attack on the monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This monster has no blood, it is my natural enemy." Father Waterer gradually lowered his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monster attacked again, and Father Waterer still managed to escape, and the sickle counterattack had no effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the stalemate on both sides...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗖! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lance with a storm suddenly descends from the sky, with an infinite force and indescribable penetration directly piercing the monster's body and holding it firmly Set on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嘶嘶嘶......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pegged monsters are constantly groaning and struggling, and it seems that they have not been fatally wounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is..." Father Water raised his head and looked at the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just looking up, he saw seven identical rifles in the sky again, like a fallen meteor falling from the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rifle fell and instantly nailed the monster into a hedgehog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then eight rifles interacted with each other, accompanied by a fierce storm, directly torn the monster into pieces, and died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; riding a huge ghost wolf, wearing a armor, the masked knight descends from the sky: "Mason Water, grateful, full of glory! Come with me Step into the Kingdom of God."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whit’s eyes are getting bigger and bigger, and under the wrinkled eyelids, he has a pair of crystal clear, like Gem-like blood red eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I saw, hope for redemption!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the temple, Watt’s squatting on the ground is full of shock and excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he is finally sure that there is a real god in the world today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just now, he has sworn, dedicating everything he has, and getting what he is far beyond his imaginary knowledge and a new vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has already withstood the power of the apocalyptic storm hunting, he feels that his corrupted soul has been reborn, feeling that his knowledge and thinking have entered a new In the realm, he mastered the new knowledge and saw the real roots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even, the oath of his and the bloody maze, the mark left by the horror monster, and the sacred library’s own restraint, It is a great power to dissipate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be seen that his dilapidated trench coat has turned black, with a hooded robes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the robe, a pair of eyes burning with a ghost flame with a strange deterrent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a brand new scythe in his hand. The scythe was dark, two meters long, and the blade was one and a half meters long. It portrayed countless skeletons and ghosts. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, he has turned into a true messenger of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now, you are one of the four apocalyptic apostles under my master, Watt Apostle, you must cherish this opportunity, dedicate yourself to everything, broadcast the Lord The glory of the glory, for the church to do their best."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walt’s five-spotted squatting on the ground, the voice trembled respectfully said: "Yes, great my Lord. I will You, offer everything to the servant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that, Su Ge came out of the temple with Watt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walter feels his state at this time, watching Su Ge sigh: "Thank you for your referral, so I got such a precious redemption." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled: "Giving a small number of poor people with salvation and peace is one of the core concepts of our late church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walter nodded with a deep agreement: "What are your plans for next? If you have any help, you can always tell me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Suge puts his hand on the wave: "You help me monitor the situation in Bain City and the northwestern provinces, and secretly shelter those of me. There are no other tasks for you."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this old priest, Su Ge still has enough respect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wo features the head: "This is no problem, what are your plans for the next?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Su Ge looked at the fog and said: "After the end of this soul holy grail, I intend to go to other places to see and pass the bell to a farther place."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;</div>
