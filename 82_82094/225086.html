			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At half past four, Su Ge quietly left when the lady was about to wake up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the way to the mosque, Su Ge thought about the clues he had just got at Luke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The ability to move at any time, is this procedure in some people?" Su Ge frowned, and some could not figure out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rune formation method, the operation constitutes the array method, the whole relationship is very clear. Many of the arrays that Su Ge saw have repeatedly emphasized that the technique cannot be moved casually, even if it moves by one millimeter, it will have immeasurable consequences. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, today Luke said that Su Ge’s previous learning content was subverted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go back and ask Ivan!" Su Ge let go of his brow and breathed a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Su Ge returned to the door of the cathedral to get in, he was stopped by a voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking up, I just saw Roland wearing a casual dress smiling at myself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, Roland looks good and has a hunting deer cap on his head, a blue gram on his upper body, and gray trousers on his lower body. Neutral clothes match her beautiful look, giving people a bright and beautiful look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Long time no see, beautiful Ms. Roland." Seeing Roland's present look, Su Ge's heart was completely relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland opened his arms and hugged Su Ge, smiling and asked: "Is interested in having a drink together?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know how to drink," Su Ge said truthfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s all good men who don’t drink, so let’s have coffee!” Roland gave people an unbelievable and free time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After ten minutes, two people are in the middle of the Holy Blood Square and the financial district The restaurant sits down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to eat?" A young and handsome waiter came over and asked with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge raised his head: "Hot coffee, thicker, don't sugar, add some milk."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Two people looked at each other and Su Ge stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waiter flashed a hint of concealed accident in his eyes, calmly asked: "Do you have any questions? Sir?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled: "I feel a little familiar, nothing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am the same," Roland said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, two wait." The waiter smiled and turned and walked into the kitchen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the kitchen, the waiter’s face sullenly went to the chef who was grinding the coffee and whispered, “Mr., the clergyman came, came with him. And Macock’s fiancee, two people feel what action.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged chef’s coffee beans paused and immediately said: “Everything as usual, listen What are the plans for the two people?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people in the front hall I still don't know the truth here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I need your help, Su Ge. I feel that I am a little closer to the truth." Roland said in a positive color, whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge slightly bowed his head and asked: "Talk about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland looked slightly Look around and make sure that no one is around and say carefully: "I have recently gone to the archives to get some information, and I went to the Criminal Investigation Department to see some recent cases. I found a problem."<br /><br />&nbsp "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the last two weeks, three people did not know why they committed suicide. This person is an elite with a certain status, the family is in good condition, and there is no reason to commit suicide in normal circumstances. But they suddenly commit suicide. ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this Su Ge nodded and motioned her to continue to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The time between three people is exactly four days. After that I went to the archives, guess what I found?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I found that in the past three months, an average of three people committed suicide every month, these people committed suicide The way of the interval is strange. Although the interval is not long, there are certain rules. What is even more weird is that these suicide cases have not been investigated in detail. It seems that some people intend to cover up these cases. You know, my criminal investigation department The captains, many of whom have heard of it, have never heard of it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "These three months..." Su Ge was lost in thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three months ago, it happened to be around the end of the Green Flame Brothers event. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So many suicides, there is no news at the church," Su Ge whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland nodded and continued: "There was another lawyer who committed suicide today. His wife did not believe it. He secretly found me and wanted me to help her investigate. I I promised. But I don't understand the mystery, so I hope that you will go with me to a crime scene tomorrow and help me determine the situation there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Suge indulged and nodded: "No problem, where is the location?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Abandoned factory in the eastern suburbs." Roland said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr., madam, please use." At this time the waiter came over and said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you!" Su Ge nodded with a smile and took a small drink of coffee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well? The taste is really good!" Su Ge's eyes lit up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waiter smiled and said: "Of course, this is our boss’s personal deployment. I am very proud to say that this coffee is the best drink of Baine. Coffee, no one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge’s heart moved and smiled and asked: “The food is also very delicious.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, we have a lot of returning guests." Waiter A look of pride. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled and said: "When I next time I will have an empty stomach, taste the crafts of your boss!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your support, the two are slow!" The waiter took a deep breath and immediately turned to find other guests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the waiter left, Su Ge whispered: "Is there any other news?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Roland sinks and said: "There are some, but the current lack of information is not very certain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Talk about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have investigated in detail the dozens of people who have died in the past three months, seven of whom are believers of the March goddess, and six of whom are believers in the Glorious Church. In seven or three Among the believers of the moon goddess, I can see from the archives that the godfather of two of them is Bishop Ron, and the remaining five people cannot find it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" And..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, Roland is hesitant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug did not ask, wait quietly. Silence for a few seconds, Roland said with a grin: "There are six people in the Glorious Church, three of whom are the godfathers of Mayor Arno, and the remaining three are unclear." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, Su Ge seems to figure out what to say, the face of the right color said: "No one can tell any of these messages, no one except me can do it." Don't be too weird, keep it normal, and try to protect your own safety."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understand!" Roland nodded hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, in the kitchen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waiter spit out the breath he had just sucked in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
