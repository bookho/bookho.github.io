			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerouss put away the bronze medal: "This matter is getting more and more complicated, you need to inform Bishop Ron."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger’s temptation asks: “Is it the person who killed him at the Institute of Polar Studies?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warren shook his head : "The other person who killed him, this brand is his own."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Su Ge knows it, knows that Gerlos has just The meaning of that sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You quickly go back and inform Orson, let him tell Bishop Ron to send the gods to the two, exorcise the nuns, and the police will block it here. I’m investigating everyone. I’m here for the time being.” Gerlos gave an order to Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes!" Su Ge quickly left after the order and returned to the police station. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the way back to the police station, Su Ge fell into thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The person who killed this magician is the one who is the Brotherhood of the Green Flame. However, he is actually a cult organization. Suddenly appeared. Two cult organizations, then the question is coming. Will it attract other cult organizations to come here for some reason or something?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think of this Su Ge’s heart jumped: “If this is the case, wouldn’t it mean that the entire city of Bain would be messed up?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗷呜! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Erh seems to feel Su Ge’s mood and is very concerned about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge touched his head, and his heart was inexplicably safe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After quickly returning to the police station, Su Ge said the whole thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ossen immediately nodded and said, "No problem, I will pass now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge nodded and was ready to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's wait a moment, I have other tasks here," Orson said suddenly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Other tasks?" Su Ge. Orson nodded and said: "Now the highest priority is definitely the master, but just after we received the report, one of the Bain City Museums. The inspectors suddenly went mad. Because the problem is not big, we can't apply for the church investigation, so we can only let you look at the situation and determine if there is a mysterious sign."<br /><br />&nbsp After the talk, Ossen took a shot of Su Ge’s shoulder and said: "You have been in the police for some time. Although it is still a little early, but in an extraordinary period, you must accelerate your promotion. This time. The case will be your responsibility. Except for the person in charge of other cases, the remaining police force will go to support Master Gerald."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Su Ge suddenly has some heart Hey, a face that said: "You can rest assured, Vice Minister of Sith!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ossen nodded and turned away with a gust of wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge took a deep breath and walked back to his seat to take out the badge that he had never used before, symbolizing his identity, and said in his heart: "Follow others I finally have to be alone, I hope that an ordinary case will let me finish it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't have any burden, let go! I am the first The same is true. "Jack didn't know where to get the news, came over and encouraged a sentence, and put on the coat and left in a hurry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland seems to still have some thoughts, his face is awkward, but he still shows an encouraging smile: "Come on, have confidence in yourself."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, also quickly leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug looked at Roland’s look, and said in his heart: “What happened to her? This is not the state and state of being ready to marry.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Forget it, or manage myself first!" Su Ge said, picking up his cane and leaving him with two halves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Xicheng Police Department is still a long way from the city museum in the south of the city. Because it is Su Ge himself, he can’t apply for the carriage to the police station, so he crossed the place. Five days later, I finally got on the steam locomotive of the city for the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, Mr., your pet is too big, so you can't get on the bus." The female ticket seller in a blue coat said politely at the door of the 20-meter steam locomotive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug immediately took out his own badge and said: "Lobo is a police dog. It has a high spirituality and will not interfere with any other passengers. Please rest assured."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Police dog?" The conductor looked at Lobo and then paid more attention to the badge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After determining the authenticity of the badge, the conductor was politely released. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s okay, I’ve missed the morning rush hour in the morning, and there aren’t many people on the top. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The configuration inside the car is very similar to the bus, but there are too many standing positions and there are too many seats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the expensive price, there will not be too many people in the car. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After paying 30 francs, Sug touched his pocket, leaving only 5 francs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you come back, you should find a financial reimbursement." Su Ge muttered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two ha happily squatting on the side, not screaming, not chaotic, screaming at the eyes of God, curiously watching everything here . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ticket seller stared at him for ten minutes, making sure that the beautiful big dog didn’t move, and he was relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other passengers in the car just started to give advice on Lobo, but after five minutes, they were completely conquered by Luobo’s spiritual and demon expressions. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a police dog!" These elites sighed heartily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the way, there are not many stops that need to stop, and the sound of running is not as big as Suge imagined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty minutes later, Suge tidyed up his hat and robe, took Luobo down the steam locomotive, and in front of him was a tall building . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of it is a neat and wide step. Above the steps are four white pillars carved with delicate embossed stone pillars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inside of the pillar is a large vestibule, used to shelter people from the wind and rain, inside is the classical and refined door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are not many people in the museum today. There are two security guards wearing black cotton coats and batons at the gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge walked with him and directly indicated his identity and intentions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two security guards were relieved and happy after seeing Su Ge’s badge and his teaching robes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You finally came, Joseph suddenly went crazy and scared us all." The tall security guard looked happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge asks: "Where is he now? How did you deal with it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A slightly fatter security guard said: "We were subdued with the cleaning staff at that time, and then tied him up in the warehouse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look!" Su Ge said immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You come in and wait a moment, I will go to the curator."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge nodded slightly Entering the museum, the empty hall is divided into three levels, surrounded by spiral staircases and porches, surrounded by a large number of glass cabinets for exhibitions, with a variety of things inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge looked at it roughly, both in size and size. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small compasses, skinny watches, books, and even pistols, glasses and the like. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are even large steam engines, artillery, and complex gear guns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire museum has been temporarily closed due to problems, and the entire hall is very deserted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugg took a few steps and suddenly heard some subtle voices in his ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
