			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The class that was hiding in the room was wide-eyed at this time, and his expression was sluggish and he could not speak for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Malki on the side took a shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Macock blinked and his face was dignified and said: "The umbrella, just turned into a sword, seems to have cut something."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The class was struggling to return to God at this time, and the tone was full of shock: "I have seen swordsmen, but I have never seen such a terrible sniper."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What did you see?" Macock hurriedly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is an ordinary person with only 6 sights, he can't see those Krakens. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The class organized the language, shocked and said: "He just killed two seamen in a flash, and it is a sea monster in the water!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;! ! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Macock was shocked when he heard it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not a mystery, but he knows what the Kraken is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even after two encounters, the clerics of the Holy See were struggling to repel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the surviving even the staff, the power of the Kraken can easily lift a carriage, running up to a dozen meters per second, the scales on the body are comparable to steel Swords and bullets can't open that layer of solid scales. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the Kraken’s muscle density is very strong, and even some of the weaker priest’s swords pierce the muscles of the Kraken, and even get caught by the muscles. Pull out the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You mean, Mr. Assass just killed the two Krakens!" Makok reacted suddenly. The face was shocked and the sound was even low. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The class nodded incredulously: "Yes, it’s like a chef chopping vegetables and cutting vegetables."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Upon hearing this, Macock suddenly remembered Su Ge’s calm and self-confidence, and murmured: “The general did not look at the wrong person.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other side, Moss handed down this key situation with some trembling, and his expression was full of shock: "This kind of swordsman, this kind of sniper. I thought he would be a fighter. I didn't expect it to be a master sword."士!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put down the pen, Moss immediately closes his eyes and continues to observe through the darkness: "This is not his real strength, can't let go. Seconds."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female warlock sitting in the three-story bedroom, Iyeta whispered with her eyes closed: "How far is this kind of person, hiding How far to hide."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The side of Piguton nodded hard, the evil and horrible smile, he could not forget this life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rain is still down, and Su Ge is still physically outside the cabin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the corridor, Su Ge came to the back deck of the hull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point the entire rear deck is empty and there is no one figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rain flows above it and blends into the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, there are three Krakens who just climbed up from the sea and looked up to see Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this Kraken seems to be a bit higher than the ones who have just been in the Kraken. After seeing Su Ge, they are not rushing over, but suddenly open. The mouth suddenly spit out a water column that shot like a high-pressure water gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger’s body motionless, the two water columns were placed in front of Su Ge and were blocked by invisible walls and scattered on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"咕噜噜!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this is not, the three sea monsters are called Two times, the body jumped to the deck more vigorously than the best gymnasts of human beings, and took out some rough weapons from behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are shell knives, stone spears, and rusty anchors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the three Krakens have a certain amount of wisdom, not rushing forward, but scattered into three directions, and launched an attack against Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three Krakens are extremely fast and healthy, and they are much faster than before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A distance of more than ten meters, almost in a blink of an eye came to Su Ge, from three directions to Su Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug took a deep breath, and the body slammed back in a strange angle, then the body turned a light flip, the iron umbrella became a long sword, first One waved, half of the siren head with the shell knife on the left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the body turned over in the air with a smart turn, and one foot will take a step back from kicking the sea monster with the anchor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foot is on the body of the Kraken, and the body suddenly rotates in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the brilliant sword light, the sea monster with the spear is separated and the body is separated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The weapon, not ordinary!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four groups also saw the Su Ge The particularity of the iron umbrella. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There can be such a rapid deformation, at least a four-level secret treasure." Yeta definitely said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This conclusion is also the conclusion of Moss and the class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last Albert has not yet recovered from the healthy body of Sugna. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Day, what did he experience in this year and a half? Master of Sonic Vibration? Master priest? Or Master Swordsman!?" Albert felt himself at this time. The head is shorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, this thing does not blame him for being scared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suger was only trying to find out that Gerlos had some physical exercises, to deal with Shelly, the goblin who was about to suck himself up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first he practiced muscles and practiced luck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later, in order to be more durable, he began to deeply practice the ability to control the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to exercise control, he also carried out some other exercises. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to facilitate the practice of other things, he learned some essential knowledge through the gods. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when he feels that he has a great ability to control his body, he can completely surrender this little goblin and find that he has already achieved a new knowledge system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sniper that is now manifested is not how superb his swordsmanship is, but his control over the body has reached its peak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can maximize the strength of his body through the sword, with the degree of sharpness of the artifact level of the Great God Declaration, naturally no disadvantage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don’t wear clothes, you can clearly see that Su Ge is now active every time, every time he runs a sword, his muscles under his skin are just like alive. In the rapid movement, adjust the strength of the body, make the most appropriate adjustment and condensation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, the last remaining Kraken saw it wrong, a flash of fear in his eyes, turned and ran, ready to jump into the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咔嚓! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the moment when he is ready to escape, an incomparable chain sword entangles its body like a viper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The razor blade smashed it at the moment, breaking its proud scales and cutting its body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strong pain makes it want to call out and call other companions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, just as its throat slightly caused some vibration, it had been pulled back by Su Ge and squeezed his neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咔嚓! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
