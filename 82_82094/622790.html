			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 9 am, Su Ge and Shirley followed Father Sini and the police to the Meyer Division of the Hui Yao Police Station,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After coming along, there is a worried face of Bernice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the relationship between Bernice, the whole inquiry process was very friendly. After four hours of inquiries by four clergymen and three policemen, the three people relaxed. Leave the police station. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benedict has left in a carriage after a few words from the police at the police station. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not the police who sent the Suggs, but the Father Sini. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some old faces are still lazy, the eyelids are pulling, it seems that some are not awake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the carriage that Bernice left and said calmly: "It is really convenient to have such a relative."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled: "The world is like this. It’s all about the world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The singer’s mouth is not too obvious Laughter: "But what I hate most is these filthy things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge brows and looks at Father Sini, calmly saying: "I It can be seen that you are a clergyman who has his own principles and is just right."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French Sini looked at him and asked: "How is that? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing, just a little admire. In the filthy society of the Imperial City, you can keep your heart for so many years, which makes me feel incredible. Su Ge said seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expression on Father Sini’s face eased, looked up at the sun in the sky, and said calmly: “I don’t like the sun.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's too bright, and can't give directions to people who are really lost." Father Cagnere retracted his gaze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sug smiled: "This theory is very novel because it is completely contrary to many theories."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; In general, the sun is an important indicator of the direction of the person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French Sini tied the brass chain with a slight movement, suddenly asked a very quiet look: "Have you experienced it? In a dark In the world of human horror, a soft and bright moonlight illuminates the soul, so that the thirsty and dry heart can be moistened and serene?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this Suge In my heart, I shook my head: "You are very mysterious, I don't understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The sun is too glaring, staring at the sun will make people's eyes Oh, in a permanent darkness. But the moon won't, the moonlight is soft, she can nourish our eyes and nourish our spirit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing these words Su Ge’s heart gradually began to pay attention to this priest Sini, and his eyes carefully examined the costumes of Father Sini. Su Ge found that Father Sini wore very tightly, with leather gloves and boots on both hands and feet. There are also fine chains tied with brass on the lower arm and lower leg. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This dress is very rare, or it is extinct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Su Ge’s impression, this should be a long time ago, the original logo of the Holy Swords. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brass represents sacredness and insulation, and the Expedition’s sacred swords are often eroded by blood and madness. Therefore, brass will be tied to the limbs, in the hope of eradicating those blood and madness, so that you can stay awake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, it turns out that these things are nothing but superstitions at the time and comfort to the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Sugerton was very curious about this seemingly depressed priest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go, I know the murderer is not you." Father Cagnes turned and suddenly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Ge’s mouth showed a smile and asked: “How can you be so sure?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French Sini said faintly: “Your spirit is very clean, both eyes And the heart is clear, people like you will not call the abyss demon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Su Ge still calm, smiling The answer is: "I have time to really want to have a drink with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, but not today." Father Sini said easily, turned and left . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When looking at the back of Father Sini, Su Ge asked Shirley with some doubts: "The bad things I have done, the people who have killed, there are many Is it so good like a long person?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley laughed and said: "For me, a good person is a derogatory term."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"........." Sugerton was speechless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Shirley still answered Su Ge’s question: "You used to talk to me about this sentence. This is a portrayal of you, you It’s really killing a lot of people and planning a lot of things, but these are not against the heart, but they are all heading for a better purpose. So your will is not distorted, your thoughts are not filthy. In your words, It is to miss the heart, the heart, the mouth, and the line."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's like a cup of water, like a watch, some people can see it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Ge heard this and touched his chin and smiled and said: "This year, a good face is really important."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley opened the umbrella and said with disdain: "Is your face long? For me, it can only be said on the ugly border."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Others are watching your psionic fluctuations, idiots." After that, Shelly went out first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suge doesn’t care, just step up and smile and say: “I’m ugly, and I’m stupid to hug you, I’ll never be in this life. Let go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, Su Ge will not let go. For various reasons, Shirley is the best fit for himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether it’s for Su Ge, for humans, or even for the whole world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley listened to the pause and seemed to be arrogant: "I want to eat wild fish!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then we go buy, let Betty do the grilled fish at night." Su Ge took her hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard the grilled fish, Shirley’s eyes lit up: “I can eat two... no, three. I’m three, you three, Betty and Benny Three pieces of silk are enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then buy ten." Su Ge said quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "One more waste, this fish I asked Betty in the morning, and sent fresh wild fish from the West, one for fifty miles."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then nine." Su Ge speaks very well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Su Ge two people are happily shopping, the appearance of an ordinary person in the far corner of the street reveals a glimmer of light, quietly following behind the two people, do not know what they want to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes under the glasses of Father Sini, standing in the shadow of the front office of the police station, flashed a hint of light purple light, reaching out and touching the worn sword of the rag The handle, a few purple particles that are hard to see with the naked eye, rush around his palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who are you?" Father Sini said, let go, and still look lazily and leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two hours, Gu Ju came out of the police station. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He should have been arrested as the most direct suspect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the evidence for his absence is sufficient. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
